It's also possible that a high average wage allows for this, though that might be confirmation bias as you could argue that you should expect lower wage places to see more gaming since gaming is cheaper than organized sports, but at the same time more expensive than going outside and playing catch. </text>\n",

       "<text> Smashville is considered the most balanced stage in Smash 4 because the blast zones are relatively average compared with the rest of the legal stages. The moving platform slightly benefits characters for many reasons. The existence of the platform and its mobility benefits characters that can extend combos on platforms, characters with high mobility that can take advantage of movement on platforms, characters that can shark platforms easily and characters that benefit from a slower paced game. However the relative lack of platforms benefits character that have from strong stage control and characters that need to play a higher paced game where running to platforms hurts them. And none of these categories seem to receive too much benefit (except maybe the high mobility ones). It's the most picked stage for a reason, and I'm sure I'm missing plenty of them. </text>\n",

       "\n",
       "Our rules have been reworded, and changed a little bit. There's been a massive influx of users and this has certainly caused myself and other moderators to look over some of our rules and realize their current version is very dated, and quite lacking. I won't bore you further, here's a TL;DR of the actual *changes* and explanations:\n",
       "\n",
       "-Removed the \"No tournament spoilers in the title rule\" because it's useless (this follows a similar decision from /r/leagueoflegends). If you don't want spoilers don't go on Reddit or filter out spoiler posts from your front page)  \n",
       "-Added a rule explicitly banning posts about things that happen to vaguely look like the smash ball  \n",
       "-Added a rule explicitly banning posts asking for non-smash characters to be added to smash because there are **SO MANY** of these posts, and to be honest, they aren't doing anything productive and most of them are reposts. They're perfect material for the daily discussion thread instead.  \n",
       "-We *are* however adding guidelines for how we'd like tournament threads to be posted. Because there are 800000 matches at every tournament we can't do a tournament-thread-team thing like other competitive subs, but hopefully these formats will help everyone make nice beautiful posts. We are aware tourney-tabler is outdated and will definitely be working on getting that updated for Ultimate's release.  \n",
       "\n",
       "But overall, again, the biggest change is just the wording and organisation. Consider reading them all [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/wiki/rules)\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "##\\#2: New Flairs!\n",
       "\n",
       "A few of our mods have been working very hard to get the smash ultimate flairs available for all of you guys, but unfortunately it's gonna require completely redoing our flair system which is gonna take awhile. So be on the look out for that new flairing system which I've heard is going to be better than ever!\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "##\\#3: Smash Ultimate and our future\n",
       "\n",
       "Alright listen up everybody. There's a big problem a lot of people seem to have with this sub right now that has always existed but is probably worse than ever. The problem is that there are two sorts of people who visit this sub, basically competitive and casual. The casual fans are larger in number, but they come and go. This divide is stronger and harder to deal with than almost any other video game because of quite a few reasons, and it makes the problem hard to solve. In the end we have to have rules that are stricter to both sides than other subs and that also makes a lot of people mad. We try to design our rules in order to balance the sub properly between these two communities and are constantly trying to improve on that balance, but both sides need to understand that there is another 50% of the community trying to use this sub as well.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the past week, any competitive players (as I know by the constant DMs I get from my competitive friends) will see the sub as having gotten out of control in favour of the casuals. But I can tell you based on the number of hate messages /u/DosRogers has gotten that casuals instead feel that our sub is far too strict. \n",
       "\n",
       "Is there a solution to this divide? Well, people CONSTANTLY suggest to us a second more casual or more competitive sub. There *do* already exist more competitive focused subs for /r/ssbpm and /r/ssbm, and these subs are AMAZINGLY well run honestly. But people still continue to come here, because many people, especially tournament viewers, are fans of the entire franchise not just one game. As for starting a casual sub and making /r/smashbros super competitive oriented, this NEVER works. It's been tried in the past, and in theory sounds great! But the problem is that once the new game hype dies off, there is just NO content to be had on such a sub, so the sub becomes relatively inactive and then when new hype comes around again, people would rather go to the sub that actually has people on it. So if there's a solution to this, we haven't figured it out or heard it, but if you think there's a way to design the sub better around this divide. The one thing we're trying to do atm is revive the daily discussion thread a little bit, and direct a lot of traffic to there and maybe start back up some those good ol' other weekly discussion threads.\n",
       "\n",
       "So **TL;DR**: The two communities need to learn to love each other until we find a solution that actually works, and we *are* open to suggestions, but not hopeful. The casuals need to learn to love the competitive people that keep the game/sub alive all year round, and competitive people need to understand new game hype and that for most people there is nothing more exciting to talk about than the new game.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",
       "All of that being said, now that a week of hype and CONSTANT posting has passed, we're going to move forward with these new rules and try to be more strict on many of the things we've previously been fine with. Please take this opportunity to give your feedback on the new rules, and tell us how you think we're doing implementing rules and dealing with the influx of users, and how'd you like to see us improve in the coming months towards the release of Ultimate </text>\n",

Apparently he was ranked in our city at the time, and we were all Smash 4 noobs who just brought a Wii because it was easier than bringing the Wii U. There was also the time our Math sub came over to us after school and played 3ds friendlies with us and even came to a tournament later that month.\n",

So I don't have a side in this debate, but I still follow shit on reddit/watch the big tournaments/talk with my smash friends on discord. That's not what this is about. Also, I'm a mod but this isn't a messsage from the mod team, just a personal issue I'm having as an active user, though I know I'm not the only one tired of this. Finally I use many examples or w/e from Sm4sh in this post, but it isn't exclusive to Sm4sh, that's just the most recent example of this bullshit.\n",

       "Now, I want to make this post because I think a lot of top player's views on this community are frankly backwards, misguided and unjust, and I want to make a post that explains my feelings on that attitude along with a proposition to those top players.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why is /r/smashbros important?**  \n",
       "Well, like it or not /r/smashbros is one of very few sites that host the fairly large smash community. There's essentially Reddit (250k subs for this and many more for the PM and SSBM subs), local facebook groups (in my experience mostly used for announcing/planning things, less so for discussion with the rise of discord), local scene/character discords (not likely used as much by top players in my experience), smashboards(...), twitch (not an open discussion platform in the slightest unless you're doing a real ass discussion panel) and twitter. Twitter is certainly the one most similar to reddit and also the one used by most people, and used the most by top players/personalities. The point is, when you shit smashreddit, you are shitting a huge portion of the smash fanbase. And I wish instead you would work **with** us.\n",
       "\n",
       "**But first to the average redditor** I also want to say to you redditors to not do the same shit. Don't take tweets and come on here to complain about them. Go on twitter. When one platform looks at another, pulls the arguments *they* want to discuss and then talk about those arguments amongst themselves, that isn't healthy, that just encourages more groupthink. I've seen some of you being awesome like /u/Big4Lil on that rushhoursmash stream, but posts like [these](https://xx.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7xa8ix/bayonetta_and_characters_as_functions/) or [even these kind of](https://xx.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7xa4q7/smash_twitter_in_a_nutshell/) piss me off.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Well what could I do**\n",
       "Well, in a perfect world we have discussion in real life in a great open lively debate every week at a smash bros town meeting. But that doesn't exist. I think it's clear I'd like you to stop with the shitting on us but I think the biggest thing you could do, is actually consider using this platform and let me tell you why in 3 simple reasons:\n",
       "\n",
       "1) **Expand your brand**\n",
       "Lots of you folks trynna make a living off smash? Grow your stream? Get sponsored? There are A LOT of jims over here at /r/smashbros that read this thing every fucking day. When hungrybox first started growing his brand he commented on here a lot, and still does but not as much, and in turn got a lot of supporters here and suddenly there were more hbox twitch clips on the frontpage than even mang0. It really does help just as much as if not more than twitter since you are continually making your existence known to everyone, not just your followers. And I don't mean just make an account and start posting your stream whenever it's up, that's not the best way, I mean start commenting like a regular ass user, which brings me to my second point...\n",
       "\n",
       "2) **Tell us we're wrong**\n",
       "This one's easily the most important. Have a problem with something someone says on reddit? Fucking reply. Don't tweet about it, because guess what? They probably don't see that if they're just \"some random reddit jim\". If you genuinely care about people being misinformed, genuinely want the community to change their mind or to continue to love the game, use your superior top player knowledge of the game and community to tell us why we may have misconceptions about it. If you think you're gonna get downvoted, trust me, you probably won't because people respect your opinon/are jims for you here. The Mr. R tweet calling out that anti-bayo post got hundreds of upvotes. Some commenters disagreed or w/e but people wanted to hear what you had to say. If you don't think it's important for the community to stay informed you're just wrong. If people see shit (or SAY shit) like \"bayonetta is broken fuck sm4sh\" on reddit and noone is there to tell them they might be wrong, they're gonna believe that, and maybe stop watching/playing sm4sh.\n",
       "\n",
       "3) **We're *just* as bad as any other platform you already use**\n",
       "Like I said earlier, reddit one of few platforms smashers use for discussion, but there isn't anything *incredibly* inherently wrong with it compared to others, except maybe the absence of top players calling out the bullshit, despite the fact they read it. If you don't want to use reddit because our opinions are bad or you might get flamed, well lemme tell you, I **READ** twitter, I see the toxicity and bad opinons there too (hell I **KNOW** people who are blocked by half the people to whom I'm directing this post). Reddit is no better, but no worse. You might get called a bad name or some shit, but you get called those on twitter too, and at least on reddit there are moderators to remove the absolutely awful shit. But if you can't get over the problems with reddit, the attention that it seems to give trolls, well, just give it a break then eh?\n",

       "/r/smashbros is a part of the smash community thats *probably* here to stay whether you like it or not because a lot of people like or already regularly use the platform. It's a decent and rare public platform for discussion that's main problems are either not exclusive to it or can be fixed, mostly by you. If you actually give a shit about changing people's minds about anything, about keeping your game's community alive and well, man up and make an account. Or, and this is perfectly reasonable as well, just stop reading reddit. Because if you really don't like what's going on here continuing to lurk isn't going to help your mental health. Other esports pros are often times blocked from reading their respective reddits for good reason lmao.\n",

Or better yet, comment on this post. *Or* you could tweet/stream about how I don't understand your perspective on this and I will continue to not understand and instead resent you because I probably don't follow you on twitter/twitch.\n",

You can't just say \"people downvote me because of my name\" and be more right because you keep repeating it, especially after I pointed out examples that are clearly to the contrary. I've seen your comments before, I've seen them get heavily downvoted, and in my opinion it is because of the way you write which I very clearly previously explained. You even said yourself that you think it is because of the way you wrote in the *past*, which again in my opinion hasn't changed all that much. \n",

Now, you can say it's only \"other people\" taking it as arrogant and condescending, but when it's a consistent trend it prolly means the tone of your text *IS* arrogant and condescending. That is the point in tone in text afterall, to communicate to the people reading what your attitude is by your diction and syntax. </text>\n",

And you didn't even mention the fact that I even slightly questioned one of the things you said, you just took \"I mean you're right about everything\" with no context.

Plus you don't even go into detail about why that statement might be true, which to most people would probably not be obvious.\n",

       "Then you end your comment by publicly pinging a well known 64 player, whilst also implying that you think the comment above yours is funny, most likely assumed to be because it's stupid/uninformed, when it was basically just some guy wondering/asking a question, not even making any outright statements you disagree with like \"modded FD should be legal\".

       "<text> In 20XX, professional Super Smash Brothers Melee player Mew2King announces his retirement from the ESPORT to follow his doubles partner Zeros career as a Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and 3DS player. However, it becomes evident that he is not as skilled in Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and 3DS as he was in Super Smash Brothers Melee. M2K is assigned a publicist, the bumbling Zer0 to make his new career less bumpy. Elsewhere, in outer space, an intergalactic amusement park called VGCBootcamp faces dwindling popularity, so its owner, Mr. GIMR, sends his diminutive minions, the Nerdlucks, to capture the Low-Tier-Heroes as new entertainment. The Low-Tier-Heroes live in an animated world hidden in the centre of Battlefield, but are unable to listen to the Nerdlucks' threats and challenge them to a game of Super Smash Brothers Melee to try to win back their freedom.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, the Nerdlucks steal the talents of Super Smash Brothers Melee players Mang0, PPMD, Leffen, Armada      and Hungrybox, leaving them incapable of playing. The Nerdlucks absorb the talent, transforming into the gigantic Monstars who easily intimidate the Low-Tier-Heroes. While playing Brawl with BobbyScar, TafoKints, and Zer0, M2K is sucked down a hole and is recruited by Axe to help the Heroes win against the Monstars. M2K agrees to help, but sends Axe and AMSA the Red Yoshi to his house to retrieve his Super Smash Brothers Melee gear. The two have a difficult time obtaining the controllers thanks to M2K's pocket fox, but his sponsors help them out.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile, Zer0 has been digging out the ICs chaingrab to find M2K, but spots Axe and AMSA leap down another one and pursues them, reuniting with M2K in the Heroes' world and joins the Low-Tier-Heroes. Another new recruit is Kage The Warrior, a skilled Super Smash Brothers Melee player whom Axe falls in love with. The day of the match arrives, but the first half is dominated by the Monstars, leaving the Low-Tier-Heroes unconfident. Zer0 eavesdrops on a conversation between the Monstars and GIMR, learning of how they gained their talent and informs M2K. Axe and M2K convince the rest of the Low-Tier-Heroes to fight back, and the first half of the second round allows the characters to take the lead using Fox. GIMR decides he wants M2K as a new attraction, and makes an agreement with him that he will become said attraction if he loses the match, sparing the Low-Tier-Heroes.\n",
       "\n",
       "To ensure his victory, GIMR has the Monstars play dirty and injure all of the Low-Tier-Heroes save M2K, Axe, AMSA, Kage, and Zer0. Zer0 becomes the fifth player and manages to take a stock, but is literally JV4ed by the Monstars and is removed to love nessa. The referee, Mr. Wizard, informs M2K unless the team gets a fifth player then the game is forfeit. BobbyScar appears and volunteers to be the team's fifth member. In the final seconds of the game, M2K counter picks FD and manages to use cartoon physics to extend his sword and take the last stock. Scar retires from the ESPORT, and the Monstars blast GIMR to the Moon in a rocket when they realize they don't have to take his abuse anymore. M2K convinces them to give up the stolen talents and they are welcomed to stay with the Low-Tier-Heroes.\n",
       "\n",
       "M2K and a recovered Zer0 return to the surface, the Nerdlucks dropping them off at M2K's next TR4SH local. Later on, the two visit the incapacitated Super Smash Brothers Melee players and return their talent. The players invite M2K to a four person free-for-all match but when he declines, they question his loss of talent. In a move mirroring his actual comeback in 20GG, M2K returns to EVO to reprise his Super Smash Brothers Melee career.\n",
