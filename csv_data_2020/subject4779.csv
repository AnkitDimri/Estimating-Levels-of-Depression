599," Youre under the assumption that we actually sleep? Ha! Yeah, right.

The time is 10:30. You have just sent your 16-year old son to bed; shortly after, you go to sleep yourself.

Unbeknownst to you, your son has other plans.

First, he gets out of bed and raids the fridge for shredded cheese and devours it all, as if his mouth were a vacuum, destined to purge the earth of any and all dairy products.

He shrugs on a black hoodie and goes outside. The night is cold. His friends are already there, in their monster truck. Theyre wearing Supreme hoodies and white Vans.

They all drive to a shady alleyway, shouting at girls to pull down their tops, and arrive. People are already there. Theyre gang members. And your son is the leader.

First, they buy drugs off of shady people from Craigslist and smoke them until theyre in debt. Then they drink and pick up random chicks they find on the sidewalk and bang them.

They go back into the considerably more crowded truck and drive to a building. There are people inside.

The Gucci Gang (which your son has so-cleverly named) beats them up and steals everything. Now they have money to pay back those wicked awesome dealers from Craigslist.

Then the black cloaks go on. Hoods are up. And the ritual begins.

Everyone makes a blood sacrifice, and they drag the people they beat up to the center of the room, where the pentagram lays, and start to chant. A low, cold voice laughs and says Thank you for your sacrifice.

Its almost time to get up for school. The Bros drive back to their houses, and leave after doing elaborate secret handshakes, followed by no homo.

Your son sneaks back inside your house, takes off his hoodie, pats the dog hello, and goes back inside his room. He slips in his bed and gets a few minutes of sleep before you go into his room to wake him up.

You briefly wonder why he looks so tired. Maybe the teachers are overworking him, the poor baby. You suspect nothing.

Today, one day before they would come, one of the two that would come said that they wouldn't come because something. So now there is 1 other dude and he doesn't want to go alone in the train, so he asked if other people wanted to come. The first dude reacted 3 times with no (trying to be funny but continued to be annoying) after that no one reacted because they didn't want to come or because they don't read 20 messages (due to the first being annoying)

You're basically saying that people of color don't have a right to be offended by racism that only affects them. 

They have the right, but why should they feel offended? Feeling offended doesn't offer anything good other than attention,which is not always good.

Ah, so when black people turned the other cheek when they were slaves, i guess that means the word therefore had no meaning and was powerless.

The black people who are living now where never slave themselves. So I don't think they have the rights to complain about their ancestors being slaves.
