0, ooh always wanted to take part in one of these. have to wait a few hours though 
1," hi, seconding the other person. I use social media for all 4 (regarding the last question) "
2," ""the truth about birds"" so dramatic hahaha "
3, tell us about some good songs here. I'm looking for more new music. 
4," I'll start: it's been pretty slow, I've hung out with my dog and I'll be doing chores later. I'm practising guitar too, my grade 6 exam is in 25 days. wish me luck! I'm hoping for a Distinction, but it's not looking so hot rn. "
5, hope everyone's having a good day. how's yours going so far? 
6, reverse image search confuses me 
7, 4chan stuf 
8, hi could I get the link too? 
9, that's one good father son relationship 
10, more context? then we could give our opinions more informatively 
11, happy cake day 
12, can you mark this as completed? makes it easier for users looking through the sub for challenges 
13, would be nice if you have the estimated time for the survey in the text. I always like being able to gauge how long it'll take me before clicking on it 
14, why is email mandatory? 
15," could you add something like ""option 1/2/3""? I was waiting for it to load for a bit, before realising that it was meant to be blank. might confuse a few people "
16, will you be able to post the results? 
17, no permission. can you reply with link so I can remember to take it when you've granted permission? :) thanks 
18," I wouldn't be too offended by anyone calling me these things (whether the slur was applicable or not), but I wouldn't say that they all should be freely used. I don't mind the n word in joking contexts at all, but when used seriously as a race-based insult it's **extremely** offensive imo. needs more detail, or a short explanation on what ""offensive"" means. "
19," I think you worded it in the best way possible. Reddit definitely doesn't seem to fall into the same category because you can use it ""intellectually"" (?) unlike the others. 

but I feel like Reddit still has a place in making people feel insecure like other social media, but it's just more subtle and avoidable. I'm not sure if it's worth changing the survey, depends on what kind of results you're looking for. I thought it could be applicable feedback, maybe for another project or when analysing the results. "
20," depends on the flavour of the specific cake I guess, pumpkin spice would be Thanksgiving. for the shape though, weird that it wouldn't be year-round "
21," I think you would get more responses if you made a survey where the question described how one part of the Filipino healthcare system worked, and there would be a section to give our thoughts. I don't know anything about the Filipino healthcare system as an ASEAN resident, so I don't think Westerners will know much either. "
22, is there a mailing list or something to find out when this app/product is released? I'd be interested 
23," hi, we need permission to access the survey (don't want to request it and put in my email) "
24, was the choice of social media deliberate? I don't use anything regularly besides WhatsApp and Reddit so I put 0 for everything. however that doesn't feel *fully* accurate since it makes me seem like I don't use social media. just something to consider I guess 
25," done! I liked the way you did the survey, it felt really fun to take "
26, damn. might give it a watch then 
27, nice! how was the movie? 
28, googles 
29, link doesn't work 
30," Thank you for participating! People like you make the world a better place :)

bless you "
31," sorry I can't help bc I live in Asia: my definition of cheap is CHEAP and I don't really understand US pricing. but, I just want to tell you those crochet creatures are adorable! "
32," there are multiple kinds of berries, i think you need to be more specific "
33, strawberry 
34, looks like we need permission to take the survey 
35, the basketball diaries 
36, BUY MY NUDES 
37, this bload up 
38, kdkdkd 
39, zero lol 
40," was the neutrogena lotion for the body or face? yeah, I might buy a big tub of decent drugstore moisturiser for my neck "
41, [removed] 
42," oh really?? I thought it was a high school skating team, something like Free! well then I'd better get started watching it then haha "
43," oooh thanks so much for all the links! I'm okay with dubcon/problematic fics if they're written well and it's not just violence for the sake of violence. flawed characters always have a certain charm, so I think I might enjoy the last one the most "
44," 1 upvote now, what would that mean "
45," can I wash my neck and chest with normal bar soap, and mosturise with cheap drugstore lotion? using my mosturiser and other products from my forehead to my nipples (as is recommended) seems I would go through stuff *quick*.

(no neck or chest acne, just a few bumps on my upper back) "
46, I'll check it out! thank you 
47," I've been meaning to watch YOI, but teenager love stories always make me feel a little odd. maybe I'll jump into the fanfiction side instead "
48," any specific ones to recommend, or authors? "
49," nope, I'm good with anything! "
50," okay but the ramen in the bottom right is amazing. you should fish it out and give it a try, it combines cheese and spiciness and perfection in just the right way for 3 bucks "
51, pewdiepie time 
52," same here, I remember there being three different incorrect spellings of ""disappointed"" in three separate chapters. really took me out of the mood, especially when editing a chapter shouldn't take more than 10 mins. I want to volunteer myself for it! "
53, I do it too 
54, same 
55, not if you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle. then you just wake up groggy and worse than before. 
56, wtf is the original 
57, I'll check it out! 
58," I'll check it out, thanks "
59, hope this is a thing 
60," here are two fics that I love that have the trope, I'm looking for more. they're both Inception because I love Arthur x Eames dynamics. I would prefer if the fic was set in adulthood, teenage fics don't sit right with me.

[A Fake Handshake Don't Make No Man](https://archiveofourown.org/works/481393) by recrudescence

[Unkissed](https://archiveofourown.org/works/450454) by toomuchplor

also you should read these fics if you haven't yet! they're so great  "
61," avid ao3 reader for the last 3 years, have never thought about making an account. I probably should to show my appreciation for authors more, but I've never wanted to do more than leave a like (which I regularly do). if a fic is good, I save it to my iPads safari reading list and treat that as my bookmarks. "

64, MADE IN BRITAIN 
65," ""Hope you're doing well!"" is a bit more chill than ""I hope you are doing well!"" as an example, because it sounds like something a person would actually say in conversation to a good friend. I don't communicate much with email, so it's hard to give any more concrete translations. 

perhaps you can save those ""open sounding"" emails and reread them when having trouble crafting an email. try to ""absorb"" the feel and the looseness that those open emails contain. that's what I did with other people's essays when I was having trouble finding my ""writing voice"", and it helped. "
66," I see, things make a lot more sense now. thanks for the detailed explanation! "
67," well, you're not wrong for saying it because it's just instinctual politeness, and you're trying to soften the blow. it can also come off as sarcastic, yes. its also a way to acknowledge that you were listening to the other person, by first replying ""I'm sorry, but..."" to them, and then presenting your point.



any other alternatives are going to have the same vibe of ""I don't agree with your point, here's my point"". it would be weird to start taking about your points straight away without acknowledging the other person's points as valid or invalid.



however, if you do want those alternatives, here are my ideas:
thats a fair point but...
I agree with you but...
I respectfully disagree because.../I disagree because...
you make a valid point/statement but...
I don't think that point is relevant because...
while I agree/disagree, I think/believe that...



it's all kind of the same idea though. it's all just verbal filler, to make a conversation sound like a conversation, instead of two robots mechanically arguing. "
68, [removed] 
69," maybe you shouldn't carry it around so often it's just *too* easy to use. if buying sth is as easy as swiping and you can't physically see yourself ""losing money"" you're going to be impulsive "
70, doesn't bother me 
71," not a fetish, but killers in TV shows that kill bad guys are a big thumbs up (provided they already have a pretty face) "
72," yes. I prefer ""ah."" sounds less gormless "
73," I need something to fill the Matt Alexander hole in my heart. (in the ""two dudes talking"" genre, I already listen to Hello Internet, The Complete Guide to Everything and Dear Hank and John) "
74," I was listening to the Hello internet podcast when they said ""Squarespace's RSS feed only allows up to 100 items"" (regarding only their latest 100 podcasts being displayed in most apps).

I thought that an RSS feed was like a huge multi-website timeline where you got every single article from every website you subscribed to? why does Squarespace have an RSS feed, why's it being used for podcasts, I'm entirely confused. I think my earlier idea of an RSS feed is also incorrect. "
75," if anyone has any reasons for which word they use, share it here! I'm really curious. I call it autumn because it's a fun word to pronounce, autumnal is a great word over ""fall-y"" and it's clear that you mean the leaves season, not falling down. "
76," 
nice. looking forward to the results "
77, meirl maybe? not too well versed on the meme subs 
78, link broken 
79, make another survey seeing whether fall or autumn is the more popular word? 
80," I don't think this is an antimeme, but it's great "
81," not helpful, but same "
82, nope 
83, you can use a classical guitar to do acoustic stuff first (to practice). the strings are nylon and softer and it's quieter 
84," you could hold them or ask if they want you to leave (other than the typical comforting phrases, I'm not good at those) "
85, I believe that they were firing tons and tons of arrows and one just happened to strike there. the rest just bounced off 
86," I can't say whether you like women or not, but not liking looking at dicks doesn't mean that you don't like men. "
87," technically no, but fuck u a legend "
88," I hug a pillow, smaller and softer than my head pillow "
89," just hover over it, or hold it in "
90," hm, honestly yeah 5'2 is a little short for me. I like someone, man or woman, to be at least my height (5'4) or taller. it's shallow of me, but my honest answer is that he'd have to be quite the catch.

it wouldn't be a flat out no ofc, but I don't think I can be attracted someone physically ""smaller"" than me since I'm already kinda small. sorry for the downer answer "
91, ignore it 
92, hyperhidrosis perhaps? or finding a good antiperspirant? 
93, yeah 
94, oh shit I didn't realise other people could smell me. no wonder there are green tea scented pads. I thought that was just my paranoia being paranoia 
95," yes. for me, height is just a bonus if the guy is already hot. height itself will not play any part in attraction if he isn't hot in other ways (face, other features) already "
96, in my country schools start at 7:30am-8 usually. starting later is pretty strange. I think America is just being weird here 
97," attraction to danger and an attraction to guys who literally ""do whatever they want"". on the sweeter side, it's nice to believe that you might be the person special enough to change this bad guy into a good guy. or you might want him to stay ""bad"" but treat you like a princess, which makes you feel extra special. "
98," lately all the movies I've seen have been closer to 2 hours than 1.5 hours actually. but for your question, considering our decreasing attention spans shorter movies are better for good ratings. additionally between a ""tighter"" movie where every plot element matters, and a longer and ramblier movie, the tighter one is preferable. "
99," yeah I do it too, wouldn't want to explicitly say anything to 99% of my friends. but having them suspect it is always fun "
100," serious answer, I would tell you to write more like how you talk. but do you also talk very formally? if you could give some examples of what you would say in the post, we could try to ""correct"" them for you so you can get the idea better. hard to really give advice when we don't know what exactly you mean. "
101," let's say you're writing about a fire, something like *Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire that has broken out on the premises of 123 Cavendon Road.* is too formal.

*Fire! Fire! Help me! 123 Cavendon Road. Looking forward to hearing from you. Yours truly, SweetSweetEscapism.* is just perfect. "
102," I'm not american, but Easter is mostly celebrated by Christians and little kids (with Easter eggs). Christmas is like the ""default"" year end holiday/celebration. Christmas is more cultural than religious at this point, what with Santa Claus, Christmas music, trees, gift giving, none of which is really tied to Christianity much. I don't really think the question is a valid one, but if we accept the premise, Christmas fits far better than Easter. "

116, I like your font. fancy 
117, honestly tho 
118," I don't think effort necessarily means something is cool, or interesting to watch. for me, neither video sounds interesting. but others and I would probably lean towards the aeroplane (something everyone is familiar with) vs super mario pancakes (something more niche). often the lack of popularity is because something is niche, not necessarily because people are thinking ""hitting the woah is cool, look at that nerd wasting their time shaping compenents"". 

I respect the artist showing off their talents, but frankly a dance is easier to understand  you don't need any context like knowing Super Mario. so that's probably why dances are more popular. "
119," isn't ""cool"" a subjective term, what's to say that a new dance isn't cool? it seems pretty simplistic to say that everything popular is stupid ""no matter what"". what makes the pancake mario guy cooler than the airplane guy exactly? "

121,  
122," I don't play soccer much, but the culture has always intrigued me. I want to understand where the fans are coming from, though I doubt I'll ever become a wild fanatic. I think anything that can make ""normal"" people so passionate is worth exploring a little. "
123," guess I'm throw myself in the deep end headfirst, no faffing around with rulebooks lol. thanks for the advice! "
124," should I start with iconic/game changing matches, or just see whatevers been posted lately on YouTube? "
125," I know next to nothing about football (soccer) of any kind, national or international. I have a friend that can explain terms to me, but he told me to do my own reading and just ask him when something comes up. Problem is, we both have no idea where I should start. "
126,  
127,"  I just had secondhand ick reading that lol. I took self defense classes with my younger brother for a while and hated that, even though he was in a different group and we couldn't even see each other during it. practising the steps with him at home was not any fun.

maybe it's a kind of cringe because we feel like it's ""too intimate to be allowed in this world"" or something like that? i got into my first relationship a few months ago and sometimes both our eager sincerity make me want to curl up and die. (even though I really like the guy and he makes me feel so warm inside with _feelings_)

it's just so painfully cheesy sometimes, even though I like romance and cheese. maybe an issue of self awareness?? idk man but I'm glad I'm not the only one feeling confused "
128, 6 
129," not in Asian countries, no one would let you waste food like that "
130, are you getting tired of the same songs and repetitive themes? try branching out? I like rock and recently I've been getting into rock sounding K-pop for something new 
131, rip attention spans 
132," oh my god ive been trying to put this into words but its been afflicting me for so long and i feel so bad about it. I get this way if family gatherings are going well, like i'm happy at first because I'd rather be having fun than being bored, then suddenly BAM that weird disgusted, run-away-now kinda feeling. i suddenly have the strong urge to move to the czech republic where I know nobody and start afresh.

I got it again recently when I was hanging out with my friend, his mum and his brother. they're a super tight knit family and the way they all warmly accepted me made me feel nice, then suddenly icky all over. it left after a few minutes, but not before I was considering bolting over a dumb excuse just to get out.

I'm introverted but pretty social outside of my recharging periods. I like intimacy, who wouldn't want to be close to their family, friends and partner? but sometimes that feeling makes me really want to move and leave everything I know behind.


 it's a weirdly powerful emotion, considering it comes out of almost nowhere? anyway hope you relate because I feel shitty for feeling this way and I'm hoping its a normal thing "
133," that stupid *""I wonder what people think of me"" ""they don't think of you""* is both discomforting and a lie. people do think of you and often about your negative qualities. and even if they didn't think of me at all, how's that any better? it's all just ridiculous "
134, yes. 
135," I see, good to know. don't think I'll be able to change them for a couple of months though. were you using butterfly clips before? "
136, thanks!

149," apologies on behalf of the lgbt community. we've been burned so many times by some cishet white guys that we treat all of them like shit sometimes and that's not how it should be. it's not everyone, but it's a loud minority.

it's generally seen as harmless because you guys have ""had your time"", but it's also unfair and super disrespectful at times. "

155," if the question isn't too serious or it's been answered enough already, I think a light-hearted joke is okay if it's funnier than it is annoying. goes on a case by case basis though "
156, design porn? 
157," I got a double helix about a month ago. how long did it take you guys to heal yours enough to change it out comfortably? and any tips on speeding up the process?

my second lobes took about three weeks to look + feel the same as the lobes I've had since I was 7. I think that's faster than normal, might my helix take a shorter time than the average? (a year-ish from what I've seen) "
158," as background noise for maths subjects, yes. doesn't work for subjects focused on writing "
159, yeah why not 
160, I'm imagining walking by a Starbucks and seeing through the window some guy watching porn on his phone and just nodding along while sipping his latte 
161," I see people taking the piss out of perfectly respectful questions. sure they may not be intelligent, but they were asked politely and ona sub called No Stupid Questions. if you don't have anything to contribute go away. (jokes are allowed in some circumstances though imo) "
162," seconding this guy, but the sleep cycle tends to vary a lot person to person. if you wake up at the end of 2 sleep cycles, you'll be more refreshed than waking up in the middle of your 4th cycle. that's the general idea, but you have to personalise it for yourself. "
163, why are you watching porn in public? 
164," it's more about the sublimnal ways it gets into your head and the general capitalism maximalist societies we live in

I didn't have any problems with ads until I started having spending money, now I understand why everyone hates then more. they really do get into your head and you'll be craving a burger at 3am even though you don't even like mcd burgers. you just liked the glossy juicy ad they had on that billboard yknow "
165, I look the same a year ago and I'm still waiting on that glo up 
166," this is why I always check price first, then consider if I want it "
167, my friends have had some great moments that I think deserve an Oscar 
168," bro same, I look at my problems rn with the lens of ""you'll probably have cancer, heartbreak and crippling debt in the future so this seems kinda trivial"" "
169," that's why we have the squares, for little syrup pockets. otherwise I would eat pancakes "
170," because it's super personal and it's like offering a part of your soul to someone else. if they don't like the music, it feels like they're attacking you directly. "
171," I figured that people would still find their ways around it, and since I don't live in the US or European I wasn't too invested even at the beginning. then the hyped died down and I forgot it even existed until I look at old Reddit threads "

205," the people that came to Reddit from Instagram meme pages tended to use emojis a lot. emojis became associated with annoying tryhard normies, and everyone that used them was heavily downvoted and attacked. use r/emojipolice as a reference. people are harsh about this sort of thing.

He is to fragile. He doesn't care much forplay fighting. Josephs always give the best hugs, you know you are safe when you are in his arms. You don't have to even meet him to know he is the one for you. Unsure of himself at times. Knows what he wants and goes after it.Hard to readhis mind, but not afraid to share it.

359," most bi people will tell you that this is NEVER the case and it probably isn't for 95% of them. they're frustrated because bisexuals have always been stereotyped as promiscuous cheaters, which is obviously unfair. most of the answers here are going to be along those lines.

however, I do definitely need to have both male and female situations going on to be completely satisfied. I am pretty easily tempted to cheat if monogamous, although obviously I would never do it out of respect for my partner. for me, the experience with men and women are different and I crave both. im not sure if this is due to bisexuality or just because strict monogamy isn't my thing (too much commitment), or a mix of both. probably the latter.

Since this is confirming negative bi stereotypes, I've rarely seen anyone share similar feelings. Thought I'd add my perspective into things since I suspect all the comments will be a solid ""no"". "

371," nope, it's pretty normal and I think it's quite a good arrangement, especially if you guys lived with each other as kids and know each others patterns. "
372," the problem for me has always been the vegan extremists scaring people off. most people would probably be chill going meatless for one day a week, and then slowly increasing it. many people (meat eaters and vegans) see it as so ""all or nothing"" it discourages people from even trying.

I don't know much about the meat and dairy industry, but I believe while theres demand they will find some way to keep pumping out supply. isnt mistreatment of humans still incredibly rampant in business? they won't care about animals. animals arent going to have it better unless we decrease our demand for their products significantly. "
373,  
374," what I mentioned is how most meat eaters feel when confronted with vegetarianism. it's not necessary logical, and it's not all my arguments. I don't like meat much so I try to avoid it, but I live at home, am busy, can't cook and vegetarian meals are expensive and not very filling where I live. that's personally why I still eat meat, though I try to cut down little by little

(and I maintain that if you eat meat, you should have no issues eating cats or dogs. course, I never say that because it's always taken as a troll.) "
375, ew ya'll is disgusting 
376," definitely, if it's not done gently under the sun "
377," it's such a normalised thing in most cultures to see certain dead animals packaged in a certain way as meat, it's just how so many of us were raised. most people, especially nowadays, realise that it's a flawed concept, but they were raised seeing meat was normal for many years. it takes a lot to undo that mentality. you really do need to detach a lot to be able to see how terrible the meat industry is.

even if you do realise that it's somewhat ""wrong"" meat is often the main source of protein, delicious and at almost every meal. it's hard to cut it out even if you wanted to, and if you still live at home it's especially tough. and humans have always been omnivores, it's in our genes. there's many ways to justify meat if you're looking to do so.

also vegan extremists making veganism look insane, judgemental and limiting makes meat eaters even prouder to be meat eaters "

386," like that quote, ""knowledge is knowing that tomatoes are fruit, but wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad"", I don't think calling blended tomato a smoothie makes practical sense. it clearly fits in better with soups than it does with smoothies.

however, blueberry soup sounds refreshing, light and has that fruity flavour still, so I feel like it's just a hot drink/smoothie rather than a soup. I'd have to taste and feel it to really ""know"" though. and if you eat it to warm up on a winter day, it might as well be a soup "

810, the crying dog ruined my entire day 
811," I think a lot of people do that. for me, I have a rational agent alterego that I talk to first whenever I'm facing an issue, because she literally knows me best. it helps me analyse things from a purely logical standpoint, and then we will together come up with a compromise between logic and emotions.

I treat her as a ""friend"" residing inside me, laying dormant until I'm stressed out. I'm not sure if it's healthy or not, but she's always been a help and not a hindrance so I'm good "

815," it's roleplay talk, uwu conveys a specific feeling and emotion. and the asterisks show an action, so it's easy to distinguish from talking. it's not really that creepy if you're used to the community. even in normal texts asterisks and uwu can be present, they convey quite a lot of meaning with few characters "

- selling my data to insurance companies so I get less coverage for things I'm predisposed for or have shown symptoms of in the past

- if you live in a country that generally tries to control the media (like I do) then getting your messages/calls complaining about valid flaws in the government leaked could mean jail 

- students have gotten scholarships removed due to sharing ""3dgy memes"" in a group chat. it was a very specific situation, but I would be at risk to get my scholarship removed too if my data was free to be seen

- companies wanting to hire you in the future may request to see your data and judge you on that, rather than how to present yourself in an interview. I don't think that's fair. "

926," it was a celebrity special I believe, the whole thing is probably available on the BBC website. If you just want to see James, there should be plenty of complilations on YouTube. 

If you want to see more of his work, his Mock The Week improv standup is absolutely stellar. Ken Cheng  another great comedian imo, his birds and stones routine is so clever  has a complilation on his channel.

He also was a recurring guest star on Josh Widdicombe's radio show, and he had a spot called James Acaster's Classic Scrapes. It's all on YouTube now.

If you don't want to listen to everything, at least listen to the cabadging chronicles (the playlist), it's pure gold. Also: 8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown.

945, Carl just asked if I had fun with a smile on his face. I was realllly hoping for a possessive moment but apparently not :( 
946,  
947, I am a giddy goat. 
948, spicier than sriracha 
949, season 2's character designs were probably the only improvement to S1 
950,"  never went for Bobby in-game, but I love his human version "
951," A quick two question survey (name and height). If you can get specific, please do!

Decimals would be helpful (eg 174.5cm).

957," hi there, I think you might need to fix the English translation a bit. The direct translation is a little odd (eg suits me rather not). still understandable, though. "
958," rise up, gamers "
959," strange how mint ice cream with toffee sauce was good, but toffee ice cream with mint sauce seems almost repulsive. "
960," quick survey, easy to take. props for that "
961," I forgot the name of a bullet journaller I used to watch. She was Greek (she had a traditional name I believe), spoke English and was in college. I think her pages were intricate and artsy? I can't remember much. "

975," Thanks, I'll give it a try. "
976," I've been trying to restart my day, a glitch made Henrik the one I wanted to couple with instead of Carl. Every time I try, the screen freezes on the page. If I exit the app, it goes back to Part 2 of the day and one ticket is gone. What do i do? "
977, meeee 
978, andy samberg always 
979, Yes i love them all 
980," Anyone else okay with the only option in S3 being a male MC? I'm interested in playing as one, and i don't think it's possible rn to have both male and female options. "
981, all of these wow 
982, yes pls 
983, Same here

985, these are the men marisol picked over me. Smh 
986, upvote for it not being boobs on a cartoon character 
987," um,, what?
q: will Randy and Nate allow their sexual tension to finally come to fruition and ditch jenny for each other? "
988," Elisa is terrible, i hate every shred of her being. Looks like she moved on from Carl to grafting on me instead. Jeez "
989," DUDE, SAME. Where did my sweet tech nerd virgin olive oil bby go?? Now he's trying for Elisa... ELISA. No. This is the man who angled for another kiss because he ""needed more data"". He and Elisa don't make a shred of sense. "
990, yes ginger queen 3 i would take her over Marisol and Elisa anyday 
991, Can you imagine how perfect of a match they would be tho. I can imagine Allegra clacking into preschool to pick up their kids while jakub is flexing his arms to the lunchlady. 
992, Allegra and Jakub omg. Can you imagine their tongue-out sprites side by side? 
993, i'm jumpy tigger

1002, chelsea and carl make zero sense together wtf 
1003, chelsea could've had elijah and she didnt take it 
1004," aww, a little disappointed with the standard lines. thanks for the detailed reply, i think i'll try using multiple accounts like you for kassam and carl. "
1005," not surprised about the dialogue, but I wish they'd add more personality. seems weird that people as different as Kassam and Felix could have almost the same lines. "
1006," He looks like Carl and Kassam mixed together, love it. "
1007," Carl is endgame, but I saw Kassam grinning and my heart has been stolen. For those who coupled up with him, was it everything you wanted? Is he worth a replay for once the season finishes? "
1008, if someone can find irl Carl... hmu
