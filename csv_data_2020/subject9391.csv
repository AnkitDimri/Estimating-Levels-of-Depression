And if you try to read a text with a word you've never seen before, you'll have to actually read it a couple of times before you can recognize it. It's the same with Hebrew. "

Inches are a fine unit, the problem is that there are 12 inches in a foot and 3 feet in a yard and god knows how many feet in a mile. Base 10 is just simpler, easier, more intuitive, and better in every way. As for day to day use, it really isn't more convenient. As someone who's lived with both systems, it's really no harder to use cm or meters than feet and inches. "

110," I'm late but proofs Cann be fun sometimes. They can also be tedious shit but I don't think you'll run into that in freshman year in the US. The name of the game with proofs is getting information. It's like any game: first, set a win condition. This will usually be what you need to prove, so you sure think about the final proof first; how do I prove that the triangles are congruent? Then think about how you can get more information, more angles, more lengths, and step-by-step, get to the ones you need by extrapolating from what you have.

Proofs are not a question in the same way an equation is: they're a problem to solve in any way you want. They're like the open response of math. "

173," I agree with ranger having meh core abilities, but take a look at the subclasses. They're all pretty damn awesome, especially the XGE ones. ranger has tons of identity and flavour; in its subclasses. And they're all pretty good, too!   ...Except for beastmaster, one of the coolest. There are two major problems with ranger. Core abilities, which are kinda underwhelming especially at higher levels, and of course beastmaster, which is near impossible to play without home brewing away the action cost of companion attacks. There's also the low number of spells known and short spell list, but other than those, rangers can be totally kick-ass. "

182, Just don't live in the us 
183," Oh oh yes of course!

So nouns in Hebrew have genders:  is female, thus the  gets a female suffix and becomes . Same for sky, but  is male plural, so .

Rivers  is male plural also, so it's also , and same for  and  (seeing a pattern?)

That's the basic linguistics of it, but obviously there are exceptions and such. So; the complete ~~sentence~~ paragraph? would be ""  ,   ,   ,   "" "
184," ooh ok, so rivers=, seas= (but that's an uncommon word, confusabke with days , maybe oceans ?)

As for ""the path we walk together here"", I'd say ""   "" ""the road/way/path we walk together"" or ""   "" (roughly same): there are a lot of ways to word this. Note that """" and """" are interchangeable for ""we"" or ""us"", and that while the first is slightly more 'poetic' sounding, it's a matter of taste.

""the path we walk together here"" would literally be ""     "" or ""    "", but these sentences are a bit cumbersome and feel like they have too many verbs.

Again, there's a bunch of interchangeability here: ""path"" could be either """" or """", together can be """" or """", and ""here"" could be """" or """". For the last two especially i can't really think of how to incorporate them. ~ This is where I'd love some input from other people here because wording is not my forte ~ "

187," okokok, first of all, your handwriting looks great (definetly better than mine). The only 'odd' things about it are your yuds () and your hes () ~ the yud is just a smidge too high: you want the top of it to be in line with the top of everything else*, and the margin between the two pieces of the  should be a bit bigger, that way it's more distinct from a . Otherwise, this is perfect. 


*in some fonts, yud has a little tongue sticking out from the tip going left. It's definetly not necessary but if you like it you can add it.

201," Hi! I'd just like to add two thingd to what other people have said here:

1. You are in the right place. Technically, r/translator would be the default, but in your case it's absolutely right to be here.

2. Things like blessings and other ""cultural"" phrases will never translate over perfectly; if you speak more than one language, you will understand what I mean. If you don't, just keep in mind that even if the literal meaning is close and the ""meaning"" (for lack of a better term) is also close, it will never be the exact same saying. Even if it's ""the way you would say it"", it might just not be something you'd usually say. So I just want you to keep in mind that while everything might be correct, they could still seem a bit weird to a native speaker. "

237," We largely learn 'neutral' English, meaning most people here don't really lean towards one dialect or the other. As for terms I think most people would either know the American one or both. "
238," what you have here is roughly ""i am either to find way or to make one"". also, the ""one"" at the end is male when it should be female as it's referring to 'one way', and the hebrew word for way \[\] is female. a better approximation of this phrase would be ""      "", but this really sounds bad and is not a good sentence. 'to find a way' doesn't translate perfectly into hebrew, so the best i could come up with is something like ""    "" (roughly ""i will find a way or create one""),  or ""   ,  "" (roughly ""if i won't find a way, i will create her \[it\]).

257," yo op, here's how to do this:

 #x200B;

* type regedit in start menu
* go to  HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Tcpip6\\Parameters
* right click on the white space and make a new 32 bit DWORD value
* name: DisabledComponents , value:  ffffffff , then click OK
* reboot

 #x200B;

the other methods i've seen here like uninstalling devices are too easy to repair. this is very hard to find, especially since your sister doesnt seem like the most tech savvy person (throwing stuff in lava instead of just deleting the world) and very likely doesn't know about the registry editor.

278," My grandma was smuggled out of a ghetto in a pillowcase as a baby. She was thrown over the fence to a friend who took her, and then was given from person to person, living as a Christian her whole childhood, which she could because she had light hair. We don't know much about that period, but we do know that her mother and older brother were killed in (I think) terresenstat, and her father survived but didn't contact her until years after the war, when he was married to another woman.

My grandfather really never spoke about it. My parents know more and I'm told he wrote his biography but I've not read it yet. What we do know is that he has to take his younger brother and run into the forests to evade capture. He was about 8 at the time and his brother around 5 or 6. I only know one story where they had to steal food from right under an officers nose. His brother married and I think has some children, but these days he doesn't go out of his home, and as such I've never met him. "

(also fun note; in all the languages i know \[all 2.5 of 'em\] the word ""shit"" is used in most or all of those circumstances, so maybe there is some consistency) "
299," you're missing. the. point. 

 #x200B;

in higher grades, you can do schoolwork from the moment you get home and only finish it at midnight. it's not laziness. it's not people not doing their work. it's just a lot of work. your opinion is, in fact, invalid, because you have it easy. just like i can't comment on, say, a commercial pilot's workload, because i'd have no idea what i was talking about, you can't comment on students older than you's workloads, because you have no idea what you're talking about. "
300," oh, so it's just twisting words to fit your agenda, without knowing anything about actual language. i guess i shouldn't be surprised, but its a bit underwhelming. i was expecting at least some fun linguistics and translation but i guess i should have seen it coming... "
301, i'd love it if you had an example for me. people pouring over a language they dont understand sounds entertaining 
302," How so? Can you give an example? afaik there's not much to be learnt from grammar, especially considering these guys don't speak the languages "
303," Can someone explain what they mean by ""breaking down greek and Hebrew grammar""? "
304," First, I'm not gonna ""fuck off with the you're 13 shit"", because you get less work. All I'm saying is you have it easier because you're younger. I had it easy when I was 13 too. But when you get to higher classes, it gets harder. Second, no one said that. The whole point of this post was that you can end up staying late EVEN IF you only do your homework. It's not starting your homework late at night, it's only being able to FINISH it late at night. "
305," You're contradicting yourself, but the point is that doing work until late at night is not because of ""bad work ethic"". Look, you're 13. Frankly, you ain't seen shit yet. Hell, I ain't seen shit yet. I'm about to start the most difficult year of school in my country, and I don't expect to sleep before 11 pretty much any day. "
306," Actually, no, some of us cant "
307, So not doing work is a good work ethic? 
308, No the point I'm making is that when you have a terrible work ethic you don't do your work 
309," terrible work ethic

Ok

do work late at night

What? No, I don't do it at all, that's the point of a terrible work ethic "

330," I'd like to add one small exception to everything mentioned: sometimes Hebrew is pronounced like English. Usually Jokingly, or to convey unsuredness or some other emotions. I which case, this would be the pronunciation. Any other time though, it's pretty much just wrong. "

336," Hey! So, Kepler 22 is a star (I think named after the Kepler telescope, not sure), and Kepler 22b is just the first planet orbiting it (imagine the star is a, then the planet is b) "
337," FYI exoplanets are named after their stars. So If there are 3 planets in a star system named, let's say, alpha Ursae majoris (brightest star in the Ursa majoris constellation), they would be alpha Ursae majoris b, c, and d. (skip a) 

Now, if there were two or more stars orbiting each other, they'd be A, B, C and so forth in order of decreasing brightness. And if a planet had moons they'd be numbered 1,2,3 and so on.

So let's say we have the fifth moon orbiting the third planet orbiting the second sun in the alpha Ursae majoris system. We can tell this moon would be called: alpha Ursae majoris Bd 5. Easy! "

* have them make clapping or other noises

* use a magical item to say the spells

* be a bard and play your verbal components

* have other items that make sound (throwing stones to the ground, igniting matches or powder, shattering some sort of spell ""container"")

* have them develop a ""magical sign language"" (flavored minor illusion or prestidigitation, etc.) where they make signs that actually produce sound

Of course talk to your DM before doing any of this. "

799," Well, there are two parts to making a character, stats, and, well, coming up with a character. I suggest you do the latter first. Once you have a concept, do the fillowing:

1. Pick a race and class that match your character

2. Generate stats. There are several ways to do this such as rolling, stansard array or point buy. Use whichever you prefer (PHB. 12-13)

3. Apply any racial benefits to stats. (in your race description) and calculate HP (highest value on class hit die + con mod).

4. Choose equipement. Either pick from recommended equipement (in class description) or roll for gold and buy (starting wealth PHB. 143, armor PHB. 145, weapons PHB. 149, other PHB. 150-157)

5. Choose any other class features such as proficiencies, languages and spells as per class description

Done! The PHB recommends doing things in a slightly different order, but I think that creating a character and then making it in-game makes for better characters than creating a character based on rolls, which is why I do it in this order. Hope I helped!  "

Since she wants to be friends after rejecting you, Id also conclude that she does care about you and your well being as a friend. Based on your current relationship with her, and how you feel she'd respond, I think you should consider talking to her about it. Clearly describing your situation, telling her that you're hurt, and seeing what she has to say. It's fair to assume she has given it some amount of thought herself, and might see it I  a way you cannot. Also: what's up with the guy from homecoming? Are they dating? Friends? Don't even talk?
