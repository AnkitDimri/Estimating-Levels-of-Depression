0," Obviously the internet happened, Ru. I dont know if youve heard of it.. I *gasped*. "
1," Valentina, sweetie "
2, The devil works hard but RuPaul works harder 
3, I GASPED. 
4, theres [this compilation](https://twitter.com/hyunandra/status/1144013908472033280?s=21) 
5, shes showing the kids versatility 
6,  
7, lets not forget the happy crying during the top 4 dance rehearsal :) 
8," file under: things I didnt know, oof "
9, Scaredy Kat would like a word 
10, *ooh shes different!* 
11, even the (semi-?)matching eye makeup UGH 
12, the absolute power that this picture exudes ugh 
13, Not in Frankfurt 
14," ok yeah I probably shouldnt have said its not her fault that she made several mistakes obviously if she prioritizes going to other shows instead of rehearsing thats what were gonna get, unfortunately. But the fact that she had good energy made what couldve been a disaster actually enjoyable "
15," Yeah, I thought she had great energy and was actually very funny. The only part that genuinely annoyed me was the magician. Other than that, I genuinely think she just couldnt have known where the spotlight could or couldnt reach. She was engaging so that made up for the little blunders. Im just not sure what you mean by the messed up cues? "
16, that part was so frustrating to me. all of us standing outside the doors while she was posting about being at the Prada show when she shouldve been getting ready for her own show goddamn it 
17," I actually thought her numbers were really great (besides the few slight wardrobe malfunctions) but yeah the magician that filled in between numbers completely does not go with her whole vibe. It felt like constantly going back and forth between a stunning burlesque show and a childrens party

Edit: I also wanna add that I snuck a few glances over at Aquaria while the magician was doing a number close to where she was sitting and she was NOT living "
18," I was at the second show (Milan) and she was actually over an hour late for the M G. And she made a joke about it in her intro like Oh, the traffic in Milan sucks.. conveniently "
19," thats honestly sad, especially for people who are spending a considerable amount of time and money to travel to the nearest city to see her perform (Im feeling like BooBoo the Fool Im traveling from Germany to Milan just for the show) "
20, refer to other comments in this thread. to put it simply: its a derogatory slur. many people are offended by it and it shouldnt be used *especially* by someone with such a big platform 
21, a-fucking-gain 
22,  
23," it was her episode on Whimsically Volatile that made me just love her! so sad that the edit she got paints her in such a bad light, especially since not everyone cares enough to get to know her real self off-screen "
24, Shangela mentioned that it was due to cancer 
25, what an... odd question 
26," i honestly thought it felt more like one of those producer-instigated fights bc she kept holding back laughter idk  

I agree with the not telling people what drag styles are valid part though "
27, oh yikes I didnt know about that. ya got me gal 
28, Naomi vs Derrick came out of nowhere and lasted about 2 seconds 
29, she really stepped her pussy up since S8. we have to stan 
30," If I didnt know this was Katya, Id never guess it was her in a million years. Ugh, the talent Fame possesses "
31," since I have literally nothing else to do, I went and checked and its U Wear It Well :) "
32," its a shame shell never be on All Stars, cause if she walked into snatch game as Roxanne, its over for everybody else "
33, mawma this is art 
34, the bitch committed 
35,  
36, Kameron linked her [DragCon playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/12183507730?si=XHQjBJxBQhyyDb_N1eMygA)  a couple days ago! 
37, mother does NOT play 
38, legends supporting legends 
39, Yes Ive heard this as well! Do we actually know of any other queens that wear Plastiques wigs? I feel like theyd look really good on so many people 
40, Kameron. Michaels. 
41, the *drama* of this scene was everything 
42, what *isnt* Sasha good at oh mY 
43," they do multiple crownings but Brooke and Yvie obviously knew they were top two so until they watched the finale along w the rest of us, it wasnt obvious who was going to win "
44," oh, she has TEA tea!!! "
45, Sasha Belle found dead in a ditch 
46, this is so pure yall must be so proud :) 
47," in the words of Miss Katya, *YOU HAVE THE NERVE* "
48," this right here is why she won. ugh, her mind "
49, is stealing fun for you lmao 
50, Its what she deserves 
51, you cant start your reign without a solid HUEHUEHUEHUE 
52, THIS BITCH DESERVED IT 
53, The Detox erasure is homophobic 
54, I would sell my organs to be that guy in the first row 
55, this bitch exudes so much power 
56, matata! 
57, I wanted to root for Kahanna sO badly and then she pulled up to the reunion with this petty non-issue... disappointing. 
58, I LOVE how sometimes shell start laughing before theres even a smile on her face shes a national treasure 
59," its not really a spoiler issue, its more like if they talk about it all over social media less people are going to tune in to the reunion which is what WoW is trying to avoid "
60, theres been speculation all season long and theyre not allowed to say anything until the reunion ! 
61,  
62," you can see the genuine pain in her face and it HURTS. 

and then to see Nina go... Im not emotionally stable enough for the mess that is this season "
63, legends supporting legends 
64, What were some unexpected aspects of the filming process or the competition behind the scenes? 
65, honestly aquarias responses are just embarrassing for a 20-something year old yikes 
66," Violets back tonight! not sure about aquaria but other than her, everyone else is there! "
67, *right?* this was unthinkable not that long ago and look how far weve come :) 
68,  
69, definitely related and definitely true 
70," yikes. in the words of MKD, this girl needs just a minute of Im not all that "
71, girl Im hiding my Aquaria merch forever how embarrassing 
72, Yes the way I understand it thats what it is! 
73," idk why but when you pee clear, cheer! just always sends me "
74," Scleroderma, its up on her story rn "
75, delete this immediately maam 
76, I honestly think that from an outside perspective the looks arent that bad... still dont quite measure up to most everyone elses but not horrible. Its just that weve seen the kind of immaculate looks they can turn out so we obviously had super high expectations and were inevitably let down 
77, YES when I think of these brands the very last thing that comes to mind is basic. The disappointment is hitting hard tonight 
78, thats what I was thinking. It seems to me that if they had had more creative control they wouldve turned up in something that wouldve given all of us a collective stroke (in the best way of course) 
79, Does anyone know if they had full control over what they got to wear? Or were they expected to turn it down a little since they are drag queens at a mainstream event? 
80," *When you pee clear, cheer!* "
81, imagine looking that good when opening the front camera. none of us mere mortals could ever 
82, YES thank you! 
83, I dont remember which queen it was (someone help pls) but someone said in Untucked that all her costumes for the show cost her about as much as going to college. Thats wild. 
84, delete this immediately maam 
85," i agree Sashas is for sure up there, its a very close second for me! "
86, nothing will ever beat Violets season 8 finale gown in my mind 
87, thank god shes gorgeous :) 
88, AHH. Well when are we starting our watch parties lets go maam 
89, is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/bhhoz8/got_to_see_trixies_moving_parts_documentary/?utm_source=share utm_medium=ios_app) kinda what youre looking for? 
90, *trixie scream* 
91, nO I might have to move out there then if I dont find any RPDR fans out here soon lmao 
92, her number suited her super well because there wasnt much dancing but she still puts her heart and soul into the lip sync and she serves looks while doing it! 
93, bitch I thought this was the actual photo for a hot sec! stunning!!! 
94, [here you go!](https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/beifc4/anyone_else_in_stockholm_amsterdam_birmingham/?utm_source=share utm_medium=ios_app) 
95," yeah okay I agree, I was definitely reaching with my comment there lmao "
96, I might be reaching here but I kinda like how serious Aquaria takes it? I feel like it shows how much she cares about her job and worries about how she might come off. but then again I do agree she just needs to breathe   have fun with it more 
97, what church is this sign me up 
98, My preferred method of death is her stepping on me repeatedly 
99," Violet, Trixie, and Aquaria "
100," This top 3 cured my depression, cleared my skin, paid my bills. Their impact. "
101," Thats how I felt at the Vienna show being the first one without Aquaria, but in a way it made me appreciate all the other queens performances even more. Trust me, youll still love the show! "
102, Shockingly I love the Werq the World tour tee with the tacky caricatures of them on the front 
103," I was just at the Vienna show and I have to agree Asias professionalism... we are undeserving. She has an amazing heart, not to mention a genuine talent for hosting! "
104, felt shed be The Vixen II since the beginning :/ 
105, glad you had fun!! also Im going to the Vienna show was there merch for sale?
