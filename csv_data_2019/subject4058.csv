0, I gave you an upvote at least. 
1," I don't dislike the theory of a false flag in itself, but mass propaganda behind it seems to hurt it, rather then strengthen it.  "
2," Not a great list of people there, to be honest. "
3, Good article. 
4," Shhh. Don't put facts into this only feels.

The fact that every parliament in the world has problems irrespective of voting system is NOT important here.

The fact is that politicians reflect the ""Will of the People"" in the own way and will never change. "
5, Have you lived there? 
6," The rise in the Far right has more to do with economic conditions and the internet than the left.

I never mentioned Joe Rogan, why keep bringing him up.

The reason I called you Far right is because you dislike people insulting Far Right speaker, try to force the conversation away from the issue and think everyone opposed to you is a far left ""SJW"".

I have no problem with people debating each other.

I do have a problem with people trying to downplay what the believe. "
7," The far right did not appear because of the left. They have always existed and always will.

I called him a far idiot and many people he appears with idiots, you had a problem with that. Why?

Is he not far right? or talking with far right people? "
8, Defending Far right idiots and bringing up the left all the time. 
9, You don't sound very centrist.  
10, Intelligent debate from the right again. 
11," You brought up the left as a comparison.

No party really wants the old ignorant voters look at the tories to see what you get.

You see the world as far to much of Left vs Right I think. "
12, Finally some good life lessons being taught in school. 
13," So if the Far Left are bad it is ok that the Far Right are. 

I am no friend of Far left idiots.

The working class have not abandoned Labour, just the old people who can't move with the times.

Defending Far Right idiots is not something from the centre. Nobody who holds liberal, open minded ideas looks at these bunch of muppets and thinks that is a cause worth fighting for. The Far Right breeds loser,s angry failures with nothing going from them, because thses people are easily controlled.

I am not calling for these people to be silenced, just let the spotlight hit them. These people should not be able to pretend it's ""bantz"" or a free speech issue. The Far Right hates any close look as it shows them as the clowns they are.

  "
14," Except the far right are using these connections to ""red pill"" people.

I have clicked on a link that was about a slightly right wing topic and then recommended videos up the ante. 

Now you can see this from other political groups, but not to the same extent. There is a clear propaganda effort in many countries to normalise far right views. "
15," The chart will include a few outliers of course, but it does show how connected the far right are on Social Media. "
16," Far Right guy is connected to other Far Right idiots. 

What a shocker. "
17, Any evidence or facts to back up these statements? 
18, Pick a fight? 
19, Nice tables. 
20," Be quiet. The mantra is ""the system we have now is bad, not stupid voters""

The fact that countries without FPTP are still run by stupid idiots voted in by stupid voters. "
21, I am unbanned cheers. 
22, I have no idea. There was no reason given.

They mainly target people who are well-spoken and who source their comments. These users are the biggest threat to them because they can persuade multiple others users with facts over emotions.


This made me chuckle. "
31," He banned me and didn't give a reason.

Put down the tendies /u/aleister, and spend 5 mins making rubbish up for me to be banned at least. "

 "
39," Where are they ""walking away to""? "

Not exactly former Democrats leaving the party, but two hardened trump supporters.

According to their link in the sub it was started by Brandon Straken a failed actor.
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6808229/

 I have been reading that this has been started as a psyop. Can anybody share some info? "
42," Not sure very mininal is the right word.

But it didn't help them win. "
43," This post has 31% downvotes, so I guess yes. "
44," Told you last poll.

Corbyn can never win and needs to go/s. "
45," Of course they matter. He cannot get almost any votes from the tories at this point. He has to attract the floating vote.

Right now i would not vote for the guy, but he can move on the issues except he personally feels against them. Though it is easier to change one mind than many. "
46," Time for the ""get rid off Stalinist Corbyn comments.""

Look at who is supporting the tories according to this it is the old and the people who think BREXIT is going well(the ignorant). These people will never vote Labour. Ignore them and move on.

Cotbyn needs to sort out his view on Brexit and foreign policy and wait. According to this poll if there was a vote tomorrow only 31% of people would vote tory. "
47," Or we could invest in the country and boost the economy, but that won't happen either. "
48," We have the money for all these things, it just sits in tax havens around the world. "
49," So you think we should let the US pay for troops around the world?

I don't think we can rely on the US to defend the world anymore, it is time we took responsibility for our own defence.  "
50," The EU started as a process wayback in the 50s. It has changed names , but the main idea hasn't changed. "
51," Which countires have the most soft power?

The EU got to where it is with ots of defence spending against the USSR. The countries were bound toghether by an outside threat. "
52," He seems like a cake and eat it sort of fellow. 

He wants to live in a world of peace and harmony, but doesn't want to spend any money getting there.

We can either have influence in the world or not, but we have to pay for it. "
53, You do know what forces we have now? 
54," Why not?
 "

Lets actually have a force capable of doing what is asked of it. "

57," When you went to Kazan, was it like that? "
58," Nunes finished his ""investigation"" why is he still asking for information. He knows what he will say before he gets the docs. "

60, You know where Kazan is? 
61," I dont want to defend the creep, but locally people do want the airport reopened. "

63," The daily Tommy idiot post. 

He makes the Far Right look even worse. "
64, Can I distract you as well. It looks like fun. 
65, This has nothing to do with Trump.

72, Israel always seems to be abut more than money to me. 
73, It was the first source I saw. 
74, Mueller is investigating anything he comes across. 
75, This is a group of high level people interferring in other countries politics for money. 
76," A secret group of TPTB by any stretch of the imagination are in cohoots. Lots of bought politicians and greedy idiots.


Edit: A better SS as requested. It seems that a cabal of former connected politicians have come together or been bribed to use there contacts to become involved in Ukraine.

The conspiracy seems to be a lot of these people are the same as before the overthrow several years ago. It seems that democracy there could still be under threat from people in the shadows.

Cheers for the gold. "
77,  
78, You have to live in Russia before you understand it. 
79, Best statesman? 
80, Do you feel the current president is doing much to help these issues?

How is any of the left wing?

If I look at the_d their comments match yours. "
82," Left leaning?

83, Does Mueller often talk to Trump? 
84," Shame flytape deleted his account he would have liked to have known that there was another user who has the same view on this subject.

 "
86, There  must have been at least 50 downvotes. 
87, But why would they downvote him being questioned? 
88, Why so many downvotes? 
89," It is.

The post is brigaded up, but the comments are real. "
90," What about before the vote?

 "
91, So Russia aren't part of TPTB? 
92," Of course there is brigading here.

Look at any pro establishment thread. Lots of upvotes, but all the comments destroy its arguments.

Sort by new for the truth. "
93," The calls of beware ww3 always make me laugh.

Russia cannot go to war. The country doesn't have the access to financial markets and an export driven economy. They have an army of conscripts, where anybody who can avoids going. Add to masive corruption in the system. They cannot take on the west.

The idea seems to be let Putin do what he wants or he will get angry and destroy the world. "
94, Maybe most of this sub don't believe Russia. 
95, My gran just had this. 
96, Or from the land of bears and vodka? 
97," Of course they could have won.

Many times in History ""who could have won on paper"" was ignored by the actual events. Look at France 1940 for example. "
98," That answer is not correct.

Germany declared war three times. Against the western allies in 39, agains the soviet union  in summer 41 and finally against the USA in winter 41. 

Each of these may be viewed as a mistake, but you can't lumber them all together as one choice. "
99, How? 
100, Where is the part about losing the civil war? 
101," I remember the Russians at Gettysburg or when they took Vicksburg.

Russians saved the USA in the civil war. "

106, They are now and the events mentioned had a direct link to the current situation. 
107, Look at the last remaining monarchies around the world. They evolved into something useful for democracies. 
108, No I am highlight the role a monarch plays in constitutional system. 
109," I am not in favour of autocratic monarchies, but a constitutional monarch seems a good system.  "
110," No I am not painting anything.

Any dictator of the UK would have to remove the monarchy to gain full legal uses of the powers of governments.

Can you answer my questions please? "
111," Yes that is true.

But it gave a framework for a successful change of power. "
112," Who would have taken over in Italy without a king?

Who was Franco's successor?

Cromwell was far more a dictator then any king for a long time. Read up on his rule. "
113, And removed by him in 1944. 
114," First the cam for the nationalist and I went REEEEEE, because I was a Nationalist.

Then everyone was happy. (apart from the alt right) "
115," Look at Mussolini. Removed by the king of Italy.

Look at Spain, where the king brought back democracy.

Look at England where the period without monarchy was a dictatorship.

Want any more examples?  "
116, It would also remove an obstacle to dictatorship. 
117, Which the law counts it as part of the case. 
118," He decided to film a court case.

In the UK it is against the law.

Now he is in prison.  "
119," I don't remember them being found wrong or misleading. 

Do you have a source? "
120, It does seem like a national front reunion in here. 
121,  
122," Very funny.

He can't ask a question without being banned? "
123," I have lived there for a while and you are correct on most of your points.

 "
124," No he is not.

In the last election he ""got"" 56 million votes out of a country of 140 million. The opposing candidates were picked by him. The communist candidate was a millionaire and a former member of Putin's party. There were huge numbers of fixed ballots across Russia.

He is not popular or well liked, but refuses to allow and alternative to himself. "
125, Minis Bay parking is just a cash grab. 
126, What a complete rip off. 
127," Hopefully people will try to be friendly and positive in the future. 

I don't mind losing Gammon as a term if people stay civil. "
128," I never knew that this sub was so well versed in racial connotations of everyday words and the social and political effects of them.

Lets see if this sub can maintain this level of discourse in the future. "
129, I will try to remember the high ground everyone rests upon when the next topic rolls round and people start insulting. 
130," Yes.

Most people are adults.

The Gammons are children though. "
131," Except we all know it is very different from that.

It seems the alt right are whipping people up about this. "
132, Remember we are here to talk about conspiracies. 
133," I find this Sub's attitude to this word funny.

Why are people getting so bent out of shape about this?

I called my manager a few years ago a gammon, mainly because he had a very round pink head. He was not amused, but did not find it racist.

People are complaining about insults, but they need to speak to people in real life. You will hear far worse than this about other groups.

If being called a gammon will change their mind on a who they are going to vote for, they are a simple minded fool and any party should not be trying to get their votes.

Why would you want to be beholden to the simple minded, afraid to take difficult challenges because of the fact your base is thick and can't comprehend issues?
 "
134," For non UK users, the express is a trash newspaper. "
135," Russian nationals have not turned up in court. Their lawyers have.

Why are they doing this?

The short answer is they want to see what Mueller has on them.  "
136," Looking at your downvotes, I can here the sizzle of gammon on this thread. "
137," No 90% of old people have managed to go through life without learning how the world works, To state otherwise is just fantasy. "
138," What people are you talking to?

Is there an enclave of old people who are aware of the world around them and their choices. "
139," Seems a very stupid move.

Rule 1 of EU politics- Always let the tories bicker before everyone else.   "
140," Not the ones I met.

They are nostalgic for times which never existed and have no care for the future. "
141, Have you talked to anyone over the age of 65 about politics? 
142, The fact is the old and the ignorant are dying off around the country. 
143," Of course this is being downvoted. 

My favourites were the locals who rented out rooms on Airbnb, but blamed me for causing housing problems. "
144, The money the paid was spent on them at the time. It went on the police and the NHS and other things they needed. 
145, There are a few native speakers here. 
146," About what?
 "
147," Lets wait and see, the truth shall be revealed. "
148," Of course she lied.

Why should she sit at a table with someone and not talk? "
149," I thought she would have come up with a better lie than that.

Why did Putin want to speak to her? "
150," LOL
 "
151," No

Why was she at that table? "
152," You have not seen this photo?

It refers to the title

 "
153," Of course it has nothing to do with with her ties to Putin.

Of course Trump is leftist opposition.

Of course we can not question this without it becoming a witchhunt.
 "
154, He lied. He was still leaking from it. 
155, It was Nunes who annouced this. Nobody cares what he says. 
156, I'll let the justice department do this one. 
157, Since when is colluding not a problem? 
158, Man it would hard to take those by force. The Americans had trouble in Vietnam with tunnels. They had the best success using tear gas and other non lethal chemicals.  
159," He laughs at Trump, prepare for disagreement on this sub. "
160, What happned to the rest of the cambridge analytica story channel 4 were doing? 
161, Careful of being anti Russia here. An easy way to get downvotes. 
162, Great post. 
163," Good catch.

I have seen this happen on this sub before. "
164," I think you are spot on here.

Russia can in no way hope to beat the US. "
165, You say it like they are two separate things. 
166, Forgive me for trusting the guy. 
167," No you have not.

This dossier was started by the RNC, just like I said. "
168," Do you understand how this works?

They didn't make new reports every week like a group of highschoolers.

The compile the information like a ball of string. "
169," I don't understand, they should have stopped looking for the truth because what? "
170, So he didn't go to Prague then? 
171," The infomation gathering campaign started under the RNC this is a fact and nobody doubts this.

The infomation pointed to collusion and corruption involving Russia. If you want infomation on this, what do you do? 

You get a Russian specialist in. This is were Steele appeared and the reast is history. "
172," The dossier said Cohen was a dodgy guy and he went to Prague to arrange a deal. The relevations last week support this narrative.

Which of course this article did not address. "
173," I read that he did in fact go to Prague last week. The raid was about shady leagl practises linked to the pornstar trump had an affair with.

It seems they are uncovering dodgy real estate deal linking trump, Hannity and the Russians in the middle east. "
174, I though Cohen was arrested the other day and his offices raided? 
175," The dossier had lots of details of corruption on Trump from the beginning, thats why the DNC paid to keep it going. "
176," Another good part from that text.

But unfortunately the truth about atrocities is far worse than that they are lied about and made into propaganda. The truth is that they happen. The fact often adduced as a reason for scepticism  that the same horror stories come up in war after war  merely makes it rather more likely that these stories are true. Evidently they are widespread fantasies, and war provides an opportunity of putting them into practice. Also, although it has ceased to be fashionable to say so, there is little question that what one may roughly call the whites commit far more and worse atrocities than the reds. There is not the slightest doubt, for instance, about the behaviour of the Japanese in China. Nor is there much doubt about the long tale of Fascist outrages during the last ten years in Europe. The volume of testimony is enormous, and a respectable proportion of it comes from the German press and radio. These things really happened, that is the thing to keep ones eye on. They happened even though Lord Halifax said they happened. The raping and butchering in Chinese cities, the tortures in the cellars of the Gestapo, the elderly Jewish professors flung into cesspools, the machine-gunning of refugees along the Spanish roads  they all happened, and they did not happen any the less because the Daily Telegraph has suddenly found out about them when it is five years too late.

  "
177," So the dossier was funded by the RNC first?

 "
178," Wow I lost a lot of brain cells getting through that.


So many lies.

The steele dossier was paid for first by Republicans running against trump. The article dosen't mention this fact, but like to remind readers of its connection to the DNC. "
179, So nobody here dislikes Nazis then? 
180," Next time somebody is wishing Hitler happy birthday, maybe more people will speak up.

https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8dt983/happy_birthday_hitler/
 "
181, Ignore the dictator running the control into the ground and giving his cronies money. 
182," Another good passage.

I have little direct evidence about the atrocities in the Spanish Civil War. I know that some were committed by the Republicans, and far more (they are still continuing) by the Fascists. But what impressed me then, and has impressed me ever since, is that atrocities are believed in or disbelieved in solely on grounds of political predilection. Everyone believes in the atrocities of the enemy and disbelieves in those of his own side, without ever bothering to examine the evidence. Recently I drew up a table of atrocities during the period between 1918 and the present; there was never a year when atrocities were not occurring somewhere or other, and there was hardly a single case when the Left and the Right believed in the same stories simultaneously. And stranger yet, at any moment the situation can suddenly reverse itself and yesterdays proved-to-the-hilt atrocity story can become a ridiculous lie, merely because the political landscape has changed. "
183, How do you think we can stop people posting anti Semitic or Racist things here as a false flag?  
184, https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/8dt983/happy_birthday_hitler/ 
185, To what? 
186, If it fights and plans with Nato and relies on supplies with them I would through them in together. 
187, So they didn't fight with the Germans and train them then? 
188," I remember learning about the SPLC in school. They were an organisation fighting for civil rights.

Top Minds of Reddit is a sub that laughs and mocks Racist idiots.

Yesterday we had a post about Hitler's birthday and what a good man he was and lots of comments supportting him.

Now if we combine this; a civil rights group, a sub which mocks racists and this sub which devolves into far right propaganda far to often. 

What will we get? "
189, Probably had to spend a lot of money to make it look more modern. 
190," I can sit around laughing at stupid things normally.

When I smoked in the past it had no real affect apart from becoming even lazier. "
191, So a book written by the Nazis? 
192," Yes they were.

They had a lot of freedom to do what they wanted, but they were on the same side.

The Germans used their naval bases, airstrips and had an SS division running around in the north, which was trained by the Finns. The Germans also gave the Finns armoured vehicles, guns and supplies.

The Finns were attacked by the Soviets twiceduring this period, but to say they weren't on the side of the Nazis is strecthing the truth. There seems to be a lot misinformation taught in Finnish schools, some of the comments above indicate the west left Finland isolated  and without help. I guess the volunteers from across Europe did not exist or the planes the Finns flew were not from the west. Or that the French and British didn't have an expeditionary force ready to go until Norway and Sweden said no (quite rightly to, the allies wanted to seize iron mines in Sweden) or that a bombing mission was planned against Baku.

Sorry for the rant. "
193," For all the people who don't know much about history.

The DNC did this during Watergate as well. The Republicans are put into a difficult spot here. The real benefit is discovery, the process where documents have to be given over to the other side. With the stuff already out there it looks like an open shut case. "
194, So Trump did not admit to speaking with Putin about prostitutes?  
195," These memos were written by Comey the ex head of the FBI.

They contain lots of quotes from Trump which paint him in a very bad light. "
196, Fair Enough. 
197, You thnk hate speech shouldn't be reported?

210, Which one? 
211," It is the start of a new propaganda push.

1No war with Russia

2This action will anyoy the Russians and start a war. Lets not do it avoid the war.

3Use this threat to avoid critism of Russia. "
212," They are both idiots, I give you that. "
213," No that is not true and you know it.

The crying Nazi proved you wrong. "
214, Is that a real question? 
215, People who post Nazi propaganda are the people who will be targeted 
216, Tell me when you get it. 
217, Actually most people in the real world don't like Nazi. 
218," If you have not noticed, there are lots of people who post nazi propaganda on some parts of the internet.

These people may find it hard to work if their future employers are not so fond of the third reich. "
219," They were the bad guys, but also the good guys. Humans are strange like that.

I don't like judge people in the past by what I think today. You have to look at the enviroment they were brought up in and the eviroment around them. "
220," It is not about whataboutism it is about people of a country looking at their history.

Do I want to go back to empires and colonism? No

But I look at history as it happened not through some revisionist lens. If you open a history book, inside somebody will something bad. 

People will look back on us and find our actions unacceptable to their morals and beliefs as well. "
221," You mean companies don't like hiring nazis?

Who would have thought that? "

225, Most Romans were pround of the Roman Empire.

I have no problems adding a few extra types of Britishness to diverseness we already have. "

This is the sort of thread that will get this sub banned.

After exposing corruption in Russia he has been killed. His reported phone call was of security officials and police entering his house shortly before he died. "
230,  
231," Lets see what Russia do.

I think they could be bluffing here. "
232," So you have not been to Russia or spoken with ordinary Russians then?

Corruption has been reduced? That will come as a big shock to the Russian people.

The Ukrainian people have no desire to be ruled by puppets from Russia, this is a fact.

If you spent time in Russia I think your view of the country would change a lot. "
233," I have to disagree with you on almost every point.

Have you ever lived in Russia? 

The military is an army of conscripts and most people avoid it if they can, corruption is epidemic and equipment is decades behind the west. 

China has no love of Russia and still look at the far east as an easy conquest and would have no problem with capturing it. Most Russian people I speak to are far more worried about China than the west.

Putin cares only about himself he has no love from the Russian people. Russians are angry at the corruption they see in their everyday life, the polltuion around them and image which is portrayed to the world.

His ""high popularity""? I guess he didn't he cheat in the last election then? I loved the ballon gag the best.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ayglwqw_fo

The people of Russia don't want to be dragged into a war to prop up a ""strongman"" "
234, Maybe somebody got to them and swore them to secrecy or maybe they went in a circle or maybe they are in  it as well. 
235, Careful of saying bad thing about Putin here. 
236, Who do you listen to? 
237, So Russia is not planning to take any action beyond words here? 
238," So the first person we should look at it the person who made a post about it.

Goons round up anybody who says SHi**s. "
239," Lets listen to the Syrian Mininistry for information rather than anybody from the west.

I can't think of a single reason they would lie or bend the truth.
 "
240, Ma-crone? 
241," To be honest, who was providing the liquid doesn't matter to me. But if you work out the fluid dynamics of it, fill me in. "
242," I guess you are far more sexually liberal than I am. I don't think people would want their sex lives on camera, especially if it involves pissing on Russian Prostitute.   "
243, Just because it was taken when he was a private citizen doesn't mean he can't be blackmailed now. 
244," Why?

If he can be blackmailed with it, it feels like a conspiracy. "
245," This is true.

Look at American Civil War. The south was full of people spreading lies about they are going to take you slaves and destroy the constitution. They cheated the ballots in many states to succeed from the union.  "
246," That a leader of country has been hiding a secret sex tape.

Seems like a conspiracy to me. "
247," There is a fair amount of it in the shops, not sure how many people drink it though. "
248, He is testing the waters and getting the pardons ready. 
249," Of course Russia does things like this.

Why do some people have this view as the Kremlin are peace loving hippies, that just want everyone to be friends? "
250, Have they caught the hacker known as 4chan? 
251," You seem to believe Russia over any other country.

Is there anyway you could be convinced otherwise? "
252," Some new info from the Skripal and the Russian poisoning in Salisbury.

This totally refutes what has been posted here other sources. "
253,  
254, Thanks for the info. 
255," There seems to be a tendency for some people to love bullying dictators, so called strong men. I think these people are trying to cover up for a failing in their lives.
 "
256," Lots of people on here aren't fans of conspiracies, they come on here to spread propaganda and attack the other side.

I don't know why the mods allow it. "
257, Cheers for the answer. 
258, I have read that the french suffere from problems with their guns at this time. Do you have any info about this? 
259, I have been reading up on ironclads and have found them very interesting. Unfortunately almost all of the info out there is about the ACW. I am looking at how a large naval conflict would have happened in the period 1860-1880. 
260," It could be ""food poisoning"", I heard Litvinenko had a dodgy curry which killed him as well.

Trotsky also ate a bad taco.

Russians never kill anybody. /s "
261," Using a weapon that is indiscriminate and hard to treat, sounds cunning and vicious to me. "
262," I feel he is cunning, ruthless and lucky, but he is not a great intellectual mind.
 "
263, I fail to see how he is a genius. 
264," So a person can say something and that is final and any actions afterwards shoud be ignore?

Wikileaks and Assange are connected to the Kremlin and are now just another mouthpiece. "
265," So an article reporting what somebody has stated, cannot be coneecte with the person quoted?

Wikilinks has far too strong connections to the Kremlin for my tastes. The brackets are to reflect the level of discourse you are using. "
266," The atlantic source was a invesitgator, who quit because Russia kept blocking the invesitgation.

The other links use wikileaks and infowars. Stop being a ((((concern troll))))) "
267, Maybe don't use crackpot propaganda sources. 
268, Can link the Newsweek story? 
269, What do you think then? 
270, Nobody has mentioned it to me either. 
271," Not exactly.

He wanted people to care about Putin, the most important person in the world. "
272," And nobody cares about old men suffering in Siberia, people do care about chemical attacks on the streets of Europe. "
273, Not for lack of trying. 
274, That if you cross the Kremlin death will be slow and painful. 
275, I think it was to send a message. 
276, The person quoted in the article eventually resign from the comission over Russian blocking investigations of war crimes.  
277," My money will be that it was a (((((false flag))))) and the UK killed him, because they are scared of every Russian Uber man even old men and a woman.

This is about their normal level of discourse. "
278," It was meant as a show of force like the Polonium tea. They bungled it .

There is no antidote, but never agents were developed for the battlefield to cause disruption and disable soldiers and they are good at this. They are not good for targeted killings it would seem. "
279, I am living in Russia and nobody has told me. 
280, Don't worry will adjust it now. 
281, Source? 
282," Gaddafi was overthrown for a reason. He killed his enemies and repressed his people. There parties and cheering when he died. Libyans aren't sad he is gone.

You could say the same about Syria as well. "
283, Libya and Chad seem like far better results than Syria to be honest. 
284, How has Libya been made worse? 
285," I have been following the normal chatter on here and certain posts have attracted my attention.

Russia has almost won the war, the rebels are defeated and peace is close at hand. This is completely false. https://syria.liveuamap.com/

Syria is a quagmire and Russia is trapped at the moment. They are  pushing back the rebels, but victory is far away and it could drag on for years.

USA to the rescue?

America sends troops in, the Russians pull out and now America is fighting an endless war and spending money.

Russia is free, Trump gets to be anti-Russian, Israel gets to have more protection and influence its' neighbours. Everybody is a winner.( Apart from you, the taxpayer and the civilians just trying to live their lives in peace.)  "
286," Again with the propaganda straight from the Kremlin. 

What has this got to do with conspiracies? "
287," What a coward. He finally gets what he has always wanted, an Republican govenment and control of the economy. Of course this enough to end his career, can't peddle lies forever it seems

Now he is leaving and will sit sobbing while Rage Against the Machine plays in the background. "
288," There are Paid Russians here now and there were some before.

I don't understand the ridiculous part. "
289," So there were users on this very sub posting propaganda and this of course means nothing?

 "
290, Hey I want to come back to the UK one day. 
291," The thing is you will read lots of Historians saying it was impossible or people spouting or sorts of magic statistics.

But wars are not won on hindsight or numbers, they are won on the battlefield and in the political will of leaders.  

Now lets look at how victory was possible. Two main things needed to happen.

1 The British Government needed to surrender.

2 The USSR needed to be vanquished.

If both these things had happened the war would have ended. The US could not have hoped to beat Japan and Landed forces in Germany by itself. The continual defence of Britain and Russia stopped the Germans and allowed the Allies to roll them back.

So where these two things possible?

The short answer is yes.

But lets look at the big answer. In 1940 the German army faced a force which had roughly equal numbers of troops, more gun,  more tanks and a far better strategic situation. It did have a superiority in a couple of factors, in the air and the use of its' panzers as an strategic force. The allies were dug in, had better tanks and in many cases better troops than the Germans. On paper it was impossible for the Germans to win, but they did. They won and spectacularly so. How did they do it? They had a far better plan and reluctant governments  in Belgium and Holland. 

This is a good example of what was possible in WW2.

So lets look at if the British government could have surrendered. The royal navy protected its shore and made Operation Sealion a pipe dream in many ways, but continually pressure around the world did wear the government down. If Britain had fallen Operation Overlord would never had happened, fresh troops would be free to be sent to the east and factories could produce larger numbers of armaments to fight on.

But the second point is where the war would be won or lost. The Germans deployed most men to the east and lost most men killed there. This was the place where they would have to win and gain victory. Operation Barbarossa caused the Red Army 5 million casualties and even the ""endless hordes"" as people sometimes try to paint the Russians as, could not take these losses for ever. The Soviet forces Mobilized 35 million men and lost a seventh in the first six months of the war. 

People will say the war was lost when Moscow was not taken in 1941 and the Germans were doomed to be defeated, but this doesn't hold much water. If the German had repeated this success in 1942 they would have been able to keep fighting much longer. Again the Germans had beaten a force much better on paper. So what happened to stop this? Many things the number of armoured forces on the Eastern Front weakened in 1942, many panzer divisions sat around and didn't take part in offensives. The Russian fought harder and didn't lose as many men on the battlefield or in encirclements. The Germans had to keep so many divisions in the West, which meant they were relying on Axis troops to fill in gaps in the line.

Stalingrad was a big defeat and a great Soviet success, but it again didn't doom the Germans. Production of tanks and the numbers of men on the Eastern front increased after it. In 1943 the Germans again could go on the offensive, but the Russians were prepared and after Kursk pushed the Germans back to Germany.  

The fact is as long German could keep winning victories, they could keep winning the war. 

 "
292, Yes I think we are. 
293," I would love for the government to fall, but the government knows how fragile it is an would't take risks.

They know who did this and how, they are just waiting for the Russians to keep lying easily proven false. "
294," It is hard to say if the government is winning when fighting an insurgency.

Isis has taken a knocking, that is trur, but there are still three other factions which have to be beaten before the end is near. "
295," This party line has appeared recently. Russian on the verge of winning or 99% succesful. 

https://syria.liveuamap.com/

It doesn't seem to hold much water. Assad has a long way to go before he controls Syria. "
296, It means (((((((((((((Soros)))))))))))))) pay Trump to use his basement for (((((((((((((eating Pizza))))))))))))). 
297," We have Berlusconi, the proto Trump. Stupid, despised by many of his people and a friend of Putin.

We have a Facist group which likes Putin, because why not? They look at a land where truth and freedom are restrained as a good thing.

I have to admit that I am confused why the five star movement want anything to do with Russia. It seems they fall into the same anti Eu pro Russia trap many others do. 

They does seem to be a pattern here though. Any govenment which likes Putin is weak, corrupt and filled with idiots. "
298," You prefer a state owned proganda machine rather than western sources?

I can say a smart man is doing something stupid or a a good person is being bad.  To state that a whole nation of 140 million people are barbarians and to say bombing civilians and ignore ISIS is barbaric are tow very different things.

How was Maiden a bad thing?

Why not move to Russia if you prefer it so much? The women are beautiful, the people are smart and welcoming . "
299," She did not call the Russian people Barbarians. She said the actions of the Russian Armed forces were barbaric. A big difference.

The overthrow of puppet president and removal of corruption are a bad thing now?

300, Maybe they had you tagged in RES? 
301, What is wrong with him being a Kurd? 
302, Why are you posting literally propaganda here? There is not a conspiracy just slander and assumptions. 
303," Russia can't steam roll Europe.

They don't have the tanks, the planes, the missiles, the money, the troops.

Russia had four things in large quantities, Nukes, Fossil Fuels, Subterfuge and Corruption. It is not the Soviet Union anymore. "
304," Not sure why you are bein downvoted.

There is nothing wrong with anything in your sentence, it is all correct. "
305," Or Russians who shot down a plane.

Or a dictator who opened fire on protesters.  "
306, I guess they are worried that the Kremlin will try to finish them off. 
307," My theory is that Russian wants discredit the rebel and buttress support for Assad, as a fighter against ISIS. 

They now the attack is happening before hand so try to pin it on the rebels to make them look bad.

How are the rebels getting chemical weapons into an area under siege? "
308," Maybe the Skripals don't want to see any Russian officials?

 "
309," The problem is you have to trust the Kremlin with this narrative.

Or maybe the Russians knew Assad was going to use it and then announced it to world as a false flag. "
310," Russia are the enemy.

If you look at the actions of the president over the last 18 years, there is a clear pattern. It doesn't need propaganda just the facts to see this. "
311," Why should I have a nihilistic view of the world, because I like conspiracies?

I like to search for the truth,  not disbelieve everything. "
312," Anti something can mean the organization or in general in the English language. For example ""I am anti Vegan"", this means I disagree with the ideas behind the group rather than the individuals involved. "
313," Which slur?

Putin?

 "
314," Boris is pushing this to gain power that is true.

He sees an evil, war mongering idiot and knows standing against him will win the support of voters and people around the world. "
315," What a good bait. Caught lots of ""Patriots"" who love Russia more than their own country.

Some mods here do have rather specific tastes about conspiracies. "
316," As long as they follow the sub rules, I think they should be allowed to talk rubbish here as well. "
317, It wasn't slavery then? 
318," Lol

No it doesn't.

Why not join the real world? "
319, You don't believe the Russians pay people to say this is a false flag? 
320, 300 years in the UK doesn't seem so bad. 
321," The cold war never stopped it just had a break. Russia is trying to expend its' power, but can't really force the world to move its' way any more. "
322, Really? 
323, What is your theory then? 
324, I have to agree with you there. 
325," Why do you think the author identifies Russia as a ""convenient scapegoat""? "
326," Why do you like the Kremlin so much?

An honest question. "
327, It is simple for Russia. Stop doing dodgy shit and when some dodgy shit happens they won't be blamed. 
328," Welcome to a conspiracy sub. 

If we can use conjecture and speculate here, where can we? "
329," What is left?

First of all motive. An ex spy and a tratior. He was an enemy of Russia.

Precedence. Radiation poisoning is of the table now, but the Russian Government has record of using drastically powerful weapons to kill it's enemies.

The fact is nerve agents can't be made at the kitchen sink. They need good chemists and a top lab. They also leave a trail which can be followed and are not a good weapon for criminals. 

I don't know why are Pro Kremlin. What are the good things about Putin's actions? "
330," Sorry.

I mean anti Putin. The Russian people are ok. "
331," Would you like to keep something sealed away, that if it leaks will kill you painfully and slowly and use it many years later on an old man. "

Of course it is being stifled. "
336, The man shot himself. 
337, It was paraphrased from Mein Kampf. 
338, A nerve agent is not something you want to keep around for years. It is unlikely that it is a rogue agent. 
339," Have you lived under the Russian government?

You will understand that they are on another level compared to western government.

The ""Yuan petro"" currency will not challenge the dollar and will probably damage the chinese economy.  "
340," Why do you think Russia didn't do it?
 "
341, Who do you think did it? 
342," Most stories I find do pop out out of nowhere.

Some stories like this have hints or clues before. John Oliver did a show about this last year. "
343," This is true.

The Russian Militiary is strong on paper, but couldn't beat the EU. China's fleet is still a long way of from being able to take on one af the many US fleets floating around the world.

The ""Allies are still far more powerful than the rest of the world at this point. "
344," Pack it up boys we have the facts.

This proves it never could be Russia and it must be Soros or Shillary./s "
345, Where can I get my Sinclair bucks? 
346," People can dislike more than one thing at once.

You can be anti Russian and not trust the government as well. "
347," We don't know it was just bluster. 

The UK government have no reason to blow this up so much without anything behind it.

The is a lot more evidence which will come out about this and the government is playing it cards close to its chest.

There is still no suspect, that has been announced yet for instance or how they were poisoned. "
348," Syria is worse than all those countries.

 "
349," This exactly.

The amount of times a thread will appear and the comments will rip the propaganda apart.

Look at new and you will all sorts of good threads downvoted. "
350," The greek people wanted something and the greek government gave it to them.

Unfortunately the thing they wanted was unsustainable and the government never had the balls to say to the greek people no. It will be like Brexit, sometimes they government has to tell people that what they want can't happen. "
351, Seems quite weak on their part.

356," You are missing the best one.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleiwitz_incident

The germans staged a fake attack on a radio station to give a reason for the start of WW2. "
357," You are forgetting that the clock is ticking against them and eventually the people will want to stay.

They already know the three choices they have;

1 Stay in

2 ""Vassal state""

3 No deal

Why is taking them so long when they have no power in negotiations? "
358," I think it will be fudged in the end.

Laws will be moved or ignored.

The EU don't want us to leave, most politicians here don't want to leave and the number of the public who do shrinks everyday. "
359," I don't think it will go that far, but we will have spent a huge amount of money for little. "
360, It was a lot more complicated than that at the moment. It was impossible to declare war on country before it existed and it was not about democracy rather and independence movement. 
361, They have already negotiated  a extra period on top of that and will go for more extensions. 
362," I am in favour of it, but the government should be clear to people about what will happen.
 "
363, They could have started earlier and been serious in discussions. 
364," It seems we will see on of the most unscrupulous events in British Democracy.

I don't support Brexit in any way, but the government seems to be delaying the exit until the majority of people who voted for it are dead and then will cancel it.

It has been two years already and it has not happened and it never will. The government should be honest with Brexiteers and move on with running the country.
 "
365, How does this website have this information?  
366," Iraq was a shitshow I agree.

Libya is what I always find strange. Gaddafi was an awful human being and nobody is sad he is dead. Libya is far better than Syria at the moment.

Why does it always come up in these conversations? "
367, Why did you omit Shillary Clinton's Shill Farms? 
368, I think this is the most likely result. 
369, Or maybe Russia should stop using nerve agents. 
370, Why do you believe Russia over the west here? 
371, Sounds like a conspiracy to me. 
372, The truth will set you free. 
373," I have looked into him, but he didn't invent the term mainstream media. "
374, So you think we should stick with mainstream media? 
375," Can you post a time stamp or tell me the time he said it, I may be a little deaf. "
376, I have to agree with you. 
377, You don't feel it is attached to one political group? 
378," Didn't hear the term mainstream media.

It seems his words have been taken over by certain people in the establishment.  "
379," Who first used it ?

Here is a link, but not final answer.
https://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/62/messages/110.html "
380," I am not disagreeing about the fact that most people watch the news.

It just seems the worst term to use to describe it. Why not use a term the better reflects what it is?

What would you call it? "
381, Seems better than what we have now. 
382," When did the term  Mainstream Media appear?

Educate me. "
383," It does not mean anything it was cooked up by some politicans to smear people they didn't like.

It does not mean anything when you think about it. Is mainstream good or bad? "
384," No we can't.

But can you focus on why you disagree with me? "
385, That's why I think Mainstream media is not a good term. It doesn't reflect what is actually going on in the USA. 
386," Why is it stupid, can you elaborate on your point? "
387," That was quick.

What is your problem with my suggestion? "

Why not use a term like Corporate Controlled Media?

It shows the difference between the people and the elite and doesn't make us look like fringe lunatics.  "

392," A video by a wargamer exploring the military history of the 1940 Battle of the Netherlands. This video tries to meld history and wargaming to help teach people about history. I found his work interesting and I thought I would share it about and see what other people though about it.

405, I have had the same experience as you. It seems they have evolved and added a few topics to back up that they are a real person. 
406, You don't think it was a rigged election? 
407," Russians don't love to vote for Putin. If they did, he would not need to fix the election.

Russians have always been willing to go along with the leader's crazy plans and then complain about them. They are smart people, but seem to have a blind spot when it comes to leaders. "
408, Do you believe there are Russians paid by Kremlin on here? 
409," I am not sure it is a translation problem, they don't seem to understand the western mindset.

I disagree with you about more people shouldn't trust the government. Putin would be out tomorrow if the Russian people cared about politics. The only reason we don't have people like him in our country is due the strength of the people. "

This article is a good start.

The only country I have been to where people have no trust in what their government says, is Russia ironically.

They believe nothing and question everything. It may sound great, but what you have is an uninformed zombiefied mass of people.

I don't doubt that other countries are on here, but they seem smarter than the Kremlin trolls, who talk such bollocks, that they are clear to spot.

Cheers for a good post in response. "
412, Keep up the good work. 
413," Why not focus on one problem at a time.

I think a huge cover up is being done right now by the government, but this is not the place.

This about Russians being paid to manipulate information.

Do you think the Kremlin pay people to be on here?  "
414," I don't think you are a Russian employee, but why does you comment seem straight from the Kremlin?

1 ""their"" not us, sounds strange coming from a person from this country.

2 Whataboutism. Forget Russia, look at other countries.  "
415," So you are against power hungry Republican smearing names, distorting the truth, lying and using the government to attack their enemies? "

421," This company have affected election all over the world.

The infomation is being covered up, but in a few years it will slip out. "
422," The solution would have been for them to save for their future and not fritter away money, but that didn't happen. "
423," Does anyone remember the flights out of Afghanistan, when the worst terrorists escaped before the fall of the Taliban?

We have the biggest catch of an organisation conspiring to manipulate people and the UK government is letting the evidence slip away.

Two good links to get background info.

http://bellacaledonia.org.uk/2018/03/22/scl-and-the-phantom-contract/

What evidence is being covered up do you think? "
424,  
425," It is not about UK independence, it is about destroying the EU.

That is what he wants to do. "
426," There seems to be two camps here.

1 Is denying it and saying it is not true and it is not a conspiracy.

2 Is happy that a conspiracy has been uncovered and the people who are manipulating the world have taken a defeat.

No guess who calls themselves the real conspiracy theorists and claims that everyone else is brainwashed. "
427, An Ip which was tracked the the Russian security services no less. 
428," Pretty much this.

I have yet to see another country, were drunk people fight as much as ours. "
429," If you are so English, why are you such a big trump fan? "
430, Good video. 
431," It was not that rude don't worry.
 "
432," I just have trouble with autocrats I guess.

I always feel that they band together. "
433," We are an open country where dissadents can spend their lives, without worrying about the governement hassling them. "
434," I was looking, where does it say this? "
435," If troops satrt lining up at the border, I feel we are farm beyond cutting gas. "
436," You mean a thread full of ""this comment was deleted"". 

Ask Histroians is the worst for this. "
437," The EU would be unhappy, but I don't think the Russians are likely to turn it off any time soon. "
438, Has the Italian government been formed yet? 
439," The reason some leaders in eastern Europe are Pro Putin is because they have been blackmailed and manipulated by the Kremlin. 

Did you not watch the Cambridge analyica doc the other day?

The Gas is always blown out of proportion. Russia would go bankrupt with out selling the Gas to Europe. "
440," Just when you think they can't be any stupider, they go and do this. "
441," He seemed the type of politician we needed in the EU, to help us.

This will be the damage, if Brexit happens. The long term affects will ripple for many years and really damage us. "
442, What does that have to do with anything here? 
443, I feel it was still bullshit in the original language too. 
444, Sums up the whole situation quite well I thought. 
445," If some countries say no, it could be to do with having Russian puppets as leaders.

Looking at Poland and Hungary. "
446," This is not even good propaganda.

""Tried to launch a cold war""

What does that even mean? "
447," Hey bots this thread went up in the very early morning in the UK.

Heads up for next time fellas. "
448, I spent more time in Russia than that and I am still not fluent yet. 
449, The previous power sharing deal. 
450," I was looking at this.

It seems this company is involved in emergency services rather than elections.

The SLC (slimey lying cretin) group are where they really do their work. "
451," She must be a super woman.

 I have been studying for a couple of years now. "
452, What has changed from when they made the last deal? 
453, Or they will think of their wallets and make a deal. 
454," The fact is they have left Northern Ireland without and effective government.

They should not be paid until they reach a deal. "
455," They don't work and they wanted a pay rise?

How are these people still around, who elects them? "
456," Russian is bloody difficult, not for the faint hearted. "
457," This old lie.

He is not beloved by Russians. "
458," ""Nice Girl"" Alert.

 "
459," A bit late, but here it is.

I was depressed for about 4 months, every second of every minute of every hour of everday. 

I was annoyed and frustrated and felt my life was slipping away.

Then I changed professions, studied and got a job I love. "
460," I guess it is a blanket protection to stop some people being screwwed over.

Or the government deciding to kick some people out. "
461," Wow

How do you think the government establishes facts? "
462," I feel that Cobryn can't become PM if the people don't trust him on foreign policy.

I like the fact that his open and meets with people who I disagree with, to be honest.

It is a different situation with the Kremlin, they will keep pushing until they feel force back. "
463," Maybe people on here disagree with what you are saying.

It does seem suspicious that a post will be massively upvoted, but all the comments in the post are actually contrasting with what is being said. "
464," I don't understand.

I am allowed to not be happy with Corbyn's response and feel he should do more?

Especially since I don't want the tories to stay in power any longer "
465, https://youtu.be/Igx_hB2XOzE?t=44 
466," Yes.

Watch it and see what he says. "
467," Here is the foreign secretary talking about it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igx_hB2XOzE "
468," In a world were Putin has done far more dangerous and awful things. Those comments could applied to most of the countries in the world with no problem.

 "
469, Did you watch the PM's remarks in the house of commons? 
470, Thank you for the information. 
471," So I listen to and believe the government.

What is wrong with that? "
472," I think it will bite Putin on the arse. Some of these groups will eventually turn on Russian and call for war, they always do. "
473," The government has said it was a Russian attack, have they not? "
474," Unless I am mistaken the scientists at a top secret weapons site don't go around talking to members of the public.

They give information to the government which then acts on it. When the PM says the country was attacked by a Russian nerve agent I believe the information is correct. "
475, That is some good news then. 
476," When did I say you were wrong?

Asking for facts is part of good discussion.

But again, when did the British government use nerve agents? "
477," The PM said after analysis from Porton Down informed the government that it was a Russian nerve agent.

The fact is believe what the government is saying here. At Porton Down the best scientist in the world work at identifying chemical and biological compounds and again I trust these people. The fact is the Russian governments childish response has removed and doubt that it was them. "
478," Ok prove me wrong.

When did the UK government use a nerve agent? "
479," Hitchens is one of those people who loves to argue about free speech and how far it goes. I don't mind the philosophical discussion he tries to have, but it seems out of place here. "
480," I don't know the guy personally, but the person who has to brief the PM on chemical attacks.

I know what you are going to say, it could be lies or a false flag. But to be honest I trust the government on this far more that the Russians.  "
481," Wow.

You can't produce facts, so I should shut up? "
482," Not sure about equipped though.

When I spoke to people in the army the mentioned ""borrowing"" equipment from the yanks and signals gear from the danes. "
483, When did we use a nerve agent? 
484," I am, but I don't think his comments go far enough.

Do you think he could have come out and said something stronger? "
485," Absence of evidence.

Why don't they claim none of this happened, it would be more believable at this point. "
486," He says he is not a supporter, but does not say he is a critic.

He uses generalizations instead of saying what actions he disagrees with.

And most importantly he does not say anything about the foreign affairs of Russia. No mention of hacking, political interference, attacking countries, assassinations or supporting dictators around the world.

It all strikes me as being far to weak and this will prove to be an albatross around his neck going forward. "
487," I agree that in the past we have run off to fast into adventurism, but on anything related to Putin we have to come down hard.

The Kremlin love to muddy the waters and distract from the truth. "
488," It was so weak and he could say much more.

If you compare that to other remarks he has made there is a big difference.

I like the guy and probably will vote for him, but he has to realise what sort of world we are in and be ready to defend the country. "
489," Great post. 

 "
490," Can you send me a link where Cobryn personally has a go at Putin.

I am not some right wing tory nut, I looked into this a while ago and Corbyn has always remained silent on Putin. "
491," The scientist at Porton Down have said it was Russia. The facts now say it is Russia and the anymore facts that come out will support the fact it is Russia.

When did attacking actions, which cause harm to British people become overzealous? "
492, Get ready for the comments from the Kremlin. 
493," That is true.

Except there are enemies out there that needed to be defended against. We have a leader ready t drag his country int a war it can never win. There needs to be a balance of course, but I do think we need to increase military spending to stop Russian aggression. "
494, Too true. 
495," I am for real, but we are not sabre rattling yet.

We are taking a strong action against a rogue country, who needs to be told it's action aren't acceptable.

The Russians d have more nuclear weapons, but that won't matter when they start flying. It will be the end of the world as we know it.  "
496," Good remarks.

Hopefully Labour can rise up from this and not get distracted defending Putin. "
497," I think it could be very interesting. 

I watched the Cambridge Analytics guy on there and he said some statements which seemed very hard to be true. Lets see what Zuckerberg says.

Hopefully /r/spez will end up there soon. "
498," It is weird how many people cherry pick the parts of Putin they like, but ignore the whole picture. "
499, I am in the case of the majority here. I think this will cost him the next election. 
500," For many reasons

1 He is an intelligence asset for the government.

2 We have never used nerve agents before, I don't think a 60 year old man in Salisbury is a good premier.

3 He lives in the UK, he could have been arrested or expelled anytime we want.

4 The most important reason we didn't do it is because Russia did. "
501, Russian is not in non travel territory yet. I have lived in Russia with no problems. 
502, Why do you feel it is dangerous? 
503, Your English is good enough don't worry. 
504," What a difference a month makes. Corbyn goes from dodgy commie traitor, to herald of peace. 

I don't want to become a total paranoid, shouting at the shadows, but there seems to be a connection. Putin, this man seems to be a central figure to so many. Not his actions really, but what he seems to represent.

Hitchens here seems to have completely lost the plot. Nato is bad, nobody knows anything abut Russia and Libya is worse than Syria.

I don't think Hitchens is a Russian Agent, he is an arrogant man who likes to be right and here is an argument where he feels he can make himself seem righteous.  "
505," Two jump to mind straight away.

Marinus van der Lubbe.

This Dutch man was a fantasist, who was framed for burning down the reichstag in 1933. He was picked due to his low intelligence and links with communist organisations. The nazis used this to consolidate power and establish a dictatorship.

Leonid Nikolaev

Another patsy this one was a malnourished angry ex communist. Jobless and angry against the world, he was picked to kill one of the most powerful me in the USSR. In 1934 he shot Sergey Kirov head of the communist organisation in Leningrad. 


 "
506," It is annoying that he is destroying Britain's future by keeping the tories in power.

The fact is Cobryn has never said anything bad about Putin. I looked it up last year and there were vague statements, but no real criticism. I don't mind if he meets with groups, who I don't like, but The Kremlin is another matter indeed.

Hopefully they can knock some sense in him soon.   "
507," Have you spoken to Russian people?

They don't watch the news or even know any of this is happening. You seem to think everything the British Government says is lies and have a fondness for dictorships.

What country are you from by the way? English doesn't seem to be your first language. "
508, Good point. 
509, Not enough comments? 
510," It seems to be active by comments, not by upvoting or number of subs. "
511, Why so? 
512," It seems another Russian Exile has been killed. Tensions are already high and I think they will get higher.

http://news.met.police.uk/news/murder-investigation-launched-after-man-found-dead-in-new-malden-298894 "
513, http://news.met.police.uk/news/murder-investigation-launched-after-man-found-dead-in-new-malden-298894 
514," They all know it.

They don't watch the news, most people there don't even know this is going on. "
515," It may not be the best thing, but it seemed something out of the ordinary.  "
516, [removed] 
517,  
518," I guess they had better taste.
 "
519, Excuse me? 
520," Unfortunately it is not true, although it does always seem to come up in topics.

The soviets had just smashed Manchuria, but a landing was out of the question.

The US and UK had completed multiple landings and knew it would be a bloodbath even with all the right equipment and experience.

The USSR had no equipment or experience and they way of fighting would not have worked in a naval landing. 

This idea seems to have come out of Russia and reflects their view of the world.  "
521, Or the daily mail 
522," That term is only used by ""enemies of the people"", don't you know "
523," Old habit, I call the UK there as well.

I one of May's citizens of nowhere I guess. "
524, Yep 
525," Many everyday, I live there.

I was speaking to one when I read you comment and he had no idea abut the whole thing. "
526, I think it would be interesting to compare the two sides at least. 
527, Most Russians I speak to have no idea about this. It isn't even on their radar. 
528," This is a good sign, I was kind of expecting him to ignore it.

 Or say both sides have good spies, but not as a good as someone he knows, which is the best person he has, but not as good as they told him he was and has been the best which is very important for making America great again.

Or something like that. "
529," Much better than I was hoping for, but lets see actions. "
530, They laugh at me as a foolish westerner. 
531," https://lawfareblog.com/prime-minister-mays-use-force-claim-clarifying-law-governs-uks-options-1

This link works. "
532, And what did you think? 
533," Sort of.

It was stronger than I expected and I am glad he said it.

But I still feel he can go back on it. "
534, Do speak a lot with russians? 
535,  
536, I wonder how Putin will react to this. 
537," The clip actually shows him saying it was Russia. 

""We treat that as fact"" "
538, Ofcom will ban them soon don't worry. 
539," They are a joke.

Apparently only 55% of people know how Navalny is. Lol

There is not a single person I have spoken to in Russia who didn't have an opinion on him. "
540, Thanks 
541," RT are not going to say Putin did it, now are they. "
542," They are cool.

There are some things I don't like about them such as Racism and Homophobia, but they are fed propaganda about this.  "
543," Having lived there I can say this isn't true.

You don't find many people who like him. "
544," Try this website.

https://snoopsnoo.com

It looks at a profile in 5 secs. "
545, http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/378083-deputy-tillerson-is-unaware-of-the-reason-for-his-dismissal 
546," I think that they will give the cash back, but things are moving in a bigger direction. "
547," Russian people don't love him, they fear him.

He is the worst leader they have had in a very long time.

He is corrupt, murderous and isolating Russia for very little gain. "
548," No he hadn't.

He found out from twitter. "
549," It turns out the circlejerk was correct.

Cum for everyone. "
550," As much as I don't like the tories, it is not the moment for political shots.

I don't like a lot of the choices they have made, but we have to face this issue straight on. "
551," Of course it was linked.

Tillerson has not gone aboard the Trump Train's destination of servitude to Russia. "
552, Farage and Salmond could lose a few nicker then.     
553, Or Hilary and Obama. 
554," It was up earlier, but with the sub private now, I am not sure. Maybe on an archive. "
555," I am sceptical too.

It does seem conected with comments yesterday about Russia. "
556, So I guess this is not the first time the CIA have been involved in a major way with a political party? 
557," Fair enough making the sub private.

I justed want to see about the nomination of /u/recoveringGrace, I don't remember who nominated him. "
558, What happened to the nomination thread? 
559," They must know how bad it will make them look, espically right before a special election.

They just ended the house intelligence comitee's investigation, which drew some heat of them. But now they replace Tillerson and Trump is silent on the chemical attack.

I do believe they are stupid, but to say this has not been thought about would be crazy.

My money is Trump ordered it to be sped up. "
560, The fun part is Trump is both. 
561," Then why announce it today?

The fact that he critised Putin is definitely why he is gone today. "
562," I guess you don't believe that yesterdays remarks speeded things along.

Tillerson has been treading water since he called Trump an idiot, but being fired straight after critizing Russia seems strange. "
563, But the willllll of the peopleeeeee. 
564," People chatted in the other threads.

I felt it was the wrong time, May was doing something good and he should have backed her on this issue.

Unless he is a secret commie agent of course. "
565," Lets see what trump says.

Edit. Trump says your fired. I guess critizing Putin will lose you the job. "
566," So leaving the EU will cost companies across the EU billions. 

Why are we still wondering, why they are unhappy about this?  "
567, Ancient Civilization is always interesting for me. The are so many clues around the world and infomation to dig into. 
568," True, but reading through it, it does all above board. "
569, The nomination thread all seemed pretty legit and hopefully they will be good. 
570, Just wondering what they think is the most interesting conspiracy at the moment or something they always enjoy reading about. 
571, Can I ask a few questions about the new mods? 
572, What job did Bush Snr have before he was president? 
573, Downvoted for pointing out a clearly Nazi sub. It took 2 secs to look at that sub and realise what it was. 
574, I guess the people from uncensored news came here then. 
575," I joined it after /r/news started hiding the race of terrorists, but it quickly became a haven for Nazis.

I am not talking about right wing people, but people who on the fringes of the right. "
576," Of course the white house won't say anything.

But don't worry tomorrow Trump will come out with something completely opposite. Maybe against Putin or against us. "
577," Putin seems to have misjudged the reaction of this.

I guess he thought it would show how powerful he is, but instead it will put pressure from the west against him. "
578," Most Russian people I speak with think war is miles of. They don't want war and I think will be very angry with Putin once this heats up a bit.

I think it is more aimed at the people at the top, to keep them in line for the election. "
579," The plane that was shot down by Kremlin backed Rebels. Then covered up by the Kremlin.

Those people were only ""Rogue"" when they shoot down the wrong plane. "
580, Russia. 
581," Some very good laws here, hopefully some will get through.

Cheers for the post OP. "
582, I have to agree with you on this one. 
583," You first sentence sets the tone for the rest of your comment.

Not holding hostages, but going after their money. 

So 750,000 pounds is not alot of money?

So you don't care who unleashes chemical weapons, aslong as we don't offend Putin? "
584," I don't see this as domestic power play. Most Russians don't believe that the government does most of the nefarious things it does.

They look around their country and wonder how an ineffectual government which barely runs Russia can change the world. "
585, Wonder how some people will spin this into it not being the Russians now. 
586," They now it is Russia, you think the intelligence agencies don't have a suspect and haven't worked out what happened.

The government should put all avaliable pressure on russians who support the Kremlin and there are a lot in the UK.

The fact that the governement is against a strong response and want this to blow over, while taking lots of money from Pro-Putin Russians speaks volumes.

Who do you think used chemical weapons on British Shores? "
587, Not using nuclear or chemical attacks. 
588, Hacking Politicians and killing people mainly. 
589, The lack of any meaningful action against Russian actions. 
590," I am not saying there isn't some friction in the Labour party, but the papers do seem to be blowing it out of proportion.   "
591, It's why my Nan voted. 
592, I think being right wing also really attracts a certain sort of people. 
593," I am a fat greasy sadsack living in Russia.

Yes the girls do have to form a queue. "
594," But for weeks the papers have been telling me that there is ""CIVIL WAR IN LABOUR PARTY"" or ""COMMIES FIGHT COMMIES"".

It seems that the right wing papers were again spewing falsehoods. "
595," There are some people on here, who love Russia a bit to much I think. "
596, That talk aint popular round these parts. 
597, For most of the time it doesn't really affect me. It is mainly for emergencies. 
598," It did apart from in one man's head, unfortunately he is now president. "
599," I am an Expat in Russia and I would be willing to lose the Embassy, if the government actually wanted to defend its borders.
 "
600," Now I am a big fan or a second referendum, but this does seem some dodgy logic to get one.

 "
601, Wow this explains a lot of the tories motive and actions recently. 
602," I don't agree with the Russian Government, but banning Russians is not a particularly fair or useful thing to do.

Especially since most Russians who leave Russia aren't big fans of Putin. "
603," The civil war started 3 years before.

The election doesn't seem to have been particularly fair or recognized by many people outside the normal dictatorships. "
604," Saw the same everyday.

The was a famous American you could see most Fridays in Placa Catalyuna. "
605," True.

When was the last election in Syria. "
606," Good Article.

Living in Barcelona for a while made me rather cold hearted towards beggars. Seeing the same people everyday, with their hand out makes you reluctant.  "
607," So a Fascist and an Idiot are on our side from Italy.

For me this is not great news. Look at who our supporters are in this; Trump, Putin and Berlusconi.

I know this is always brought up, but ""Are we the bad guys here?"" "
608," One of the best parts of being a stupid foreigner is can ignore all of that.

People think I am an idiot so I can get away with it. "
609," The Chechan wars of course happened, but the apartment bombings have a question mark next to them.  "
610," More Government control of the internet.

Don't they know Black Mirror is not a plan of action? "
611, Or maybe they didn't do the terror attacks? 
612," Man, they voted you to hell. "
613," Interesting sub.

Thanks for the link. "
614," I guess I am a child, who doesn't read so good.

Or maybe I see an account on a website defending one of the biggest dictators on earth, a man who has no value of human life.

What do you think of Putin? "
615," You have supported the Kremlin in every comment I have seen you make on this Sub.

So far the UK has had a reserved attitude to the Russian Government, but pressure is building on them to do something.

Do you seriously think the UK can't retaliate in a meaningful manner.?  "
616," I now you are a big fan of the Kremlin, but if the government wants they can punch back far above their weight in situations like this. "
617," Now this is just conjecture, but many things.

From a direct reply, to freezing bank accounts, hacking parts of the government or putting political pressure on the Kremlin. "
618," As a British guy living in Russia, it could be a risk coming here.

The Russian people are friendly and welcoming, but it is the Russian Government that will decide how this plays out.

If the government wants to show this as a symbol of Pride and Power, I think fans will be ok.

If the government wants to show strength and patriotism there will be violence.  "
619, You would be surprised at what the UK can do and will do. 
620," Bingo.

The allies needed each other to win the war. "
621," I have the day of because of it, so I'm pretty happy. "
622, Why can't we agree with that statement? 
623, I think he has been roasted. 
624," Looks good.

Keep the Hun on the Run. "
625, The rason was GW wanted more money. 
626," Sort of. It was due to the Horus Heresy.

Why did it change to what it is now? "
627," Imperial Army.

Why did the name change? "
628, What was the Imperial Guard called before? 
629," Do you want to release the info on who was a russian bot and was banned?

It would be interesting too see how many time people were arguing with them. "
630," Why?
 "
631," I agree that the west should leave Syria alone, but to claim they are the cause of all of this is misleading.

You have Saudi Arabia, Israel, Iran and Russia all interfering. My conspiracy senses are tingling.  "
632," Except the world these people live in. When you speak to them, they could sort it out in two mins and have time for a cuppa.

Watch Question time for the examples of these people. "
633," Somebody has a cannon they want to use, I think. "
634," As a Brit who works and lives abroad. I think that 10% is a bit low.

There are lots of Brits on the continent, but in almost every country around the world too. "
635," I guess you live under the flight path. 

Most people I spoke to want it as a passenger service.

Also the huge increase in homes would cripple the local area's roads and hospitals. Westwood cross is bad enough, it doesn't need to get worse. "
636," Pretty much spot on.

At first it was called /r/piratesofthrones .

Then it became about memes. "
637," I would say age is becoming a huge factor, which I guess is related to culture. "
638," It seemed people were on different contracts. It did not matter the colour of people's skin, just if they started when the job was more generous. "
639," Another ""Pay Gap"", just what we need.

If people who work the same job are paid different we need to do something.

If two people are doing two different jobs then we should pay them different wages. "
640," She has many options that will please me:

1 No Brexit

2 We actually know what we want and lets negoiate

3 The British people voted for something and I am going to give them exactly what they want. "
641, Is the detail of the speech going to be different from what they sent out to the press? 
642, Finally a reason to be proud of Planet Thanet. 
643," NEWS EXCLUSIVE

I was in my local boozer with Jezzer last week, he was on a session and steaming. I asked him about growing his own potatoes and he said I hate McCain chips. McCain chips is code of course for the McCain famly so of course he kidnapped Madeline.

More details in next Sunday's Express I presume.

644," Make sure you have enough Union jacks, Boris cakes (you eat them and they are still there), a couple of tubes of Will of the People and a box of stiff upper lips. "
645," If the speech does not match up with the drivel in the article, I will apologise.

If the speech is just waffle and platitudes I will be vindicated. "
646," Did you read the article?

The government makes the speech available to journalists before it has been said so they can report on it. "
647, I guess the are some subs on this very website full of these people. 
648, It was a joke. The biggest amount of rubbish I have seen in a speech since last week. 
649, The EU is going to eat David Davis alive. 
650," Pretty much.

The far left has always believed in solidarity, the people vs the rich.

The far right believes they are special, their country is special and the future belongs to them. "
651," Spot on.

The average Brexiteer sounds like the average Catalan Independence fan I heard when living in Barcelona or the fans of Putin I hear now in Russia.

They all say the exact same things, but don't realize that it is just right wing nonsense. "
652," Have you ever been to Britain. 

The difference between different parts is huge. "
653, Fair Enough. 
654," Don't worry about what people are saying, I can't imagine us leaving the EU. "
655, I think we agree with each other. 
656," It will make us more reliant on foreign exports, but I think we should make the full jump and reap the benefits. "
657, Did he give it to himself? 
658," I think we are at the point now.

If the foods stops coming in, we can't grow enough.

Better to save money and preserve the countryside. "
659," In some areas maybe.

I think the country needs to make better use of the land it has. Less bungalows and more planned towns. "
660, I do think you are correct. 
661," I view it like this.

Farming is not econimcally viable anymore, it only exists due to massive subsides. 

The EU provided that money, the rural areas voted to leave.

The Government should not cover that money, the farms are not economically viable so they should go.

The government uses that money to cover the costs of Brexit and invest in the country.

 "
662," The farmers voted to leave the EU, so that 3 billion pounds should stop too.

Increase wages and more money for the public sector. Food prices would increase, but the countryside could be turned into a nature reserve. "
663," I disagree.

If these people feel that someone is rude, this something I can't tell them they are wrong.  "
664," Depends how you view it.

If someone tells me they don't like someone I believe. I don't think because they are a women they might be wrong about who they like. "
665," So true. This person is ""mansplaining"" what these women feel. "
666, A simple meet up of people who were not handed life on a plate. Discussing their futures abd of the country. 
667," This is spot on.

I am living in Russia at the moment and cannot agree more.
 "
668, The fact I am working very far away stops me. 
669," I am working class, but I think Brexit is a load of cobblers.

I was watching John Prescott on Question time the other day and that is what Labour needs more of. "
670," No mention of being working class.

I thought it was the Labour Party.

Why not have an event for working class young people of all colours, creeds and races?

It seems like a middle class lovefest. "
671, To be honest living in Germany would not be up my street. You gotta ave a sense of humour. 
672, TPTB? 
673," In the UK we use capital letters or is your keyboard knackered?
 "
674," Does any of this matter?

Tusk has already shot it down and there is no room to move it with out upsetting some people. "
675," Try this link.

https://snoopsnoo.com

It looks through their history for you. "
676," Lol

Nationalized then. "
677," This article will add another 1000 voters to Labour.

How can these people not hear what they sound like? "
678," The job cuts are driven by the desire for profit.

I expect quality to fall and this company to be privatised with a few years. "
679, Or where they are done or even what time of day. 
680," Thank you for showing evidence.

In another comment I linked another poll showing something different.

Can't trust the polls I guess. "
681," You repeat something which is not true.

When I ask for evidence, you state opinions as facts.

Now you just swear at me.

If you have any evidence of what you say tell me or be quiet. "
682," So that survey was wrong and the people who were asked were wrong?

Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it was wrong. "
683," What about this then:
https://www.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/7t5oyp/britons_favour_second_referendum_by_16point/

You know about this, because you commented in this post. "
684," Actually support for a second referendum does exist as numerous polls have stated.

I would not be surprised if the next government has one. "
685," I would like it to be so, but May has proven to be resilient like mold in the bathroom. "
686," So the people who voted against Brexit now want their vote to not be ignored by leaving the EU, which they don't want to do?

You have lost me at this point. "
687," Got any stats on that?

I have not seen anything that matches that. "
688, If that person is not a Russian being paid I will be shocked. 
689," No his problem is the huge for support for staying in the EU from the public 49% voted to stay in.

His other problem is wanting an impossible policy that cannot exist in the real world. "
690, Now this is a good answer. 
691," A real answer versus what some have written here.

The soviets lost huge numbers of men in 1941. Millions of dead and captured. The equipment was bad, the tactics were dreadful and the strategy was suicidal.

After this it improved, but the soviets lost more men the Germans in every battle. Why? They had bad tactics, the men were badly trained and equipment was in short supply and not up to quality in a lot of cases. The strategic situation had improved though. Men were dying in droves, but the war was being won.

 "
692, Could take down the government. 
693," The problem as always is that the EU won't give us something for nothing.

They will make this part of a bigger deal, which the far right of the troy party can't agree on.  "
694," Growth financial services LTD seem to be bankrolling UKIP.

I wonder what the deal is there. "
695, Not sure Mogg and his gang will agree to that. 
696," Now the question is, do the tory rebels topple the government? "
697," So you can study a student of a school, who you disagree with.                If I look at someone's comment history I am bad?
 "
698," You would be surprised.

It takes me about 15 mins to get a students personality down in an individual lesson. An then to react and alter the methodology. "
699, I hope computers aren't teaching the courses. 
700," The sound of sizzling gammon must be heard in every pub in leave areas.

""betrayal of the people"" "
701," Teacher

Half the job is not explaining infomation, but understnading if the students understand and the best way to get this across. "
702, Harry Potter and the escape from asskaban. 
703, [removed] 
704," My dad said it as soon as happened.

How could he know?

Bin Laden attacked the same building years earlier. "
705, This guy has eyes. 
706," So if the tories do something it doesn't matter.

If Labour support something, but don't actually do anything, it matters?

Again logic escapes you. "
707," I shared a flat with four girls and then five girls.

The group thought thing was the only thing I didn't like about it to be honest. "
708," You said black Wednesday was caused by Labour.

Facts and truth seem foreign concepts to you. "
709," LOL

You can blame the moon if you want doesn't make it so.
You are proving that facts are not important for you. "
710," They are idiots, not battle hardened SS.

 "
711," The winter of discontent was not planned by a labour government, but by militant unions, supported by their workers (the current old generation)

The tories planned the miners strike and the destruction of industry, because it would help them politically. The average guy on the street was happy because he got a dirt cheap house under buy to let.

Black Wednesday was caused by stupid economic policy. Can't blame labour on this one. "
712," I watch a lot of stuff on tv too. The Iraq war, The Afghanistan war, the London riots, the terrorist attacks recently, the new cold war. 

Like many of the things in your list list they happened to a small percentage of people, so I didn't think they were relevant.

The miners strike, the de-industrialization of the north and black Wednesday were caused by tory politicians, voted for by a generation of ""where is my share"" 

The winter of discontent was caused by workers of a generation of ""where is my share"".

I think you demonstrated my point by knowing a lot of events, but not really understanding what caused them or their effects. "
713," What world do you live on?

I do know plenty of my friends who don't have a huge interest in world affairs, but they grew up in the worst recession in a lifetime.

They know exactly about life and the choices they have to make.

Old coddled people who worked for the public sector and retired on a good pension in a paid house, have no idea about the world. "
714," No the average old person does not follow the world or current events.

The may look at the Mail or listen to news, but speaking to them shows the lack of knowledge of the future of the world. "
715, You do know the budget can't be touched by the House of Lords? 
716, I didn't know that 18 year old were destroying the future of their kids. 
717," I don't.

The amount of people over 60 who are completely ignorant of the world around them is shocking.

The fact they are happy to sell our future to benefit themselves also doesn't help. "
718," No it didn't.

The questions were tailored for each group and the leave questions were done very well by brixiteers. "
719, Where are you from? 
720, The best bit about the name is the fact he is a yank. 
721," I understand that sleep schedules are different. But look at some accounts where people claim to be from one location, but their activity matches up with another country. "
722," What is up with the times of your posts? 

Don't you sleep? "
723," https://snoopsnoo.com//u/kuddlesworth9419 

He is russian I think, look at the times. "
724, Nothing to see here Komrades /s 
725, Seems good to me. 
726, I doubt it. 
727," Where are the facts?

Government ministers are here in force, but I fail to see any details about who is against Barniers or why. "
728," It may contuine, but what has it got to do with soem idiot at the guardian? "
729," I don't mind Russian people on here talking and listening.

What I have a problem with is people shouting out the lies of the kremlin. "
730," Just say you are not attracted to this person and make clear not just looks.

If he is an arsehole and answer will make him angry. If he is a normal person he will live with it. "
731, So you don't think there are any Russians on here trying to influence people? 
732," I am reading this thinking the same thing.

None of this has happened to me. "
733," Of course.

A mole in the whitehouse, dodgy politicans all over Europe parroting the Kremlin.

Suspicious users flooding the internet with propaganda. 

Smells like a very big conspiracy. "
734," I do talk with a lot of Russians.

Not just on this sub.
 "
735," I think you are russian, because your views and ideas in an argument match up with what a lot Russian people have said in conversation.  "
736, I wonder if they can detect other online propaganda campaigns. 
737," Editing the post to win an argument. You have Reddit skills.

Are you a Russian? "
738," I am not sure what bootleg copy of Kubrick's masterpiece you picked up down the market in Moscow, but it is 2001 a space odyssey. 

Yes I am suspicious you are a Russian. "
739," Hi Ivan.

This was to over the top try to be more subtle next time.

Paka "
740," Yes. To answer the question.

The result was 51 to 49%. That is saying that the public is split straight down the middle and their is no mandate to leave.

It will not be sunk due to a few old Irish men, but a Union sticking together versus one participant who wants to bully others. "
741," It seems it will lead to an no deal and sink the economy. 

If you are ask a brexiteer they will blame the EU, saboteurs and enemies of the people, but of course not themselves of course. "
742," Never give up.

Keep trying, learn from your mistakes and stay hopeful.

But never give up. "
743," I can tell you aren't from the UK.
 "
744," Really?


I see at as a fright wing party has changed the whole mood of the country in a different direction and the middle ground has been lost.  "
745," Bingo look at Europe. The system we have now works well, people just imagine the alternative is better.

Sort of like Brexit. "
746," The french did have a reserve in May. Several infantry divisions and the four best equipped units in the army, the four DCR. "
747," It is from different places on the Meuse. In the south at Sedan they launched counterattack which were beaten back.

In the north with Rommel they tried to create new defensive lines and failed.  "
748, It seems to be super effective. 
749, Came here to say this. 
750, What standards are you judging it by? 
751," Did anyone actually watch the video?

He was asked about it, he waffles on for a minute and then at the end there was a little query and a negative response.

As I have posted on this many times, Corbyn will not promise a referendum. It will come about as part of a coalition government. "
752," You used a conditional sentence.

Your sentence ""If a new party leader is chosen 6-12 months before that, there's not much point bringing the date forward"".  If one thing  doesn't happen, then next thing should not then happen.

So your sentence can also mean that is a new leader is chosen long before an election we should have a vote.
 "
753," Yes exactly.

He should have had a snap election and not sat around waiting to be beaten. "
754," The House of Lords functions as a net these days. It catches stupid or unpopular acts the government try to shove into law.

The Brexiteers will call for revolution again if this was to happen, but it is a part of Parliamentary Democracy. The thing they voted for and claim to like, expect when it does not give them what they want. "
755," It does give the party in power an advantage, but the main reason is to keep everyone on their toes.

It stops a weak opposition existing and allow more public interaction in politics.

But as May found out last year it can cripple your party.

It is a risk, but the benefits can be huge. "
756," I like the system we have now, it is more flexible and at the same time strong.
 
It will depend on what the tories do and what they believe. "
757," You are correct, but it will hurt this country if the tories keep limping on with a new leader. "
758, Are you disagreeing with your previous comment? 
759," It looks like rats on a sinking ship to me, to be honest. "
760," Their is no rule, but if the new leader wants to change the direction they will need a mandate from the people. "
761," I agree with what you are saying.

But if enough people get on the phone or see their local MP, then it can change who the PM is. "
762," So you agree that if a new PM is chosen this year, there should be an election? "
763," I am afraid you are wrong. We vote for our local MP, a person.

The fact is the tories will have to stick with May, because they can avoid risking the collapse of the government. She is totally useless, but the other choice will either fragment the party and lead to an idiot running the country. "
764," I'm not sure.

I can see them battening down the hatches and holding on until the majority slips away, but they have got what they wanted. "
765," Then why are we leaving?, is the real question. "
766," If she goes there must be an election. 

I don't want 4 years of a party in power swapping PMs without the people having a say. "
767," It makes no sense to do this.

Right now he is saying very little and promising nothing. He will the tories fight about this and hurt themselves, while he plans for the next election.

He will get the best of both worlds, support from left wing Brexiteers and from remainers who know him being PM is the only way to stay in the EU. "
768, Don't confuse the government and the people. Most Russians are the same as people around the world.  
769," It depends on what country you are from. 

As an Englishman I get treated with respect, an Uzbeck doesn't get the same. "
770," Most of what you say is true and correct.

Apart from the problem of size. Russians always talk about this, but it is not true. The size of a country doesn't really affect how it is run in the modern age. Very small countries have advantages, but once you go above a city state the problems don't change. "
771, Are you Russian? Have you spoken to normal Russians? 
772," An upvote for making a good measured argument.

Now lets have a look a your points.

Record manufacturing output. This is true. The value of output is higher than ever. Part of a trend which has lasted for well over a hundred years. The weakening of the pound has helped this, but the effects will be balanced out once costs adjust.

New Infrastructure projects. Can you be a bit more specific on this? 

Record Low Levels of Unemployment. The figures have never been fiddled this much before. Any unemployment figures for a long time are not accurate and this only gets worse over time. The figures the government release are worthless.

No sign of exodus. In every single financial business has a plan of how to leave. Not all of them will of course, but to say there are no signs is digging your head in the sand.

The economy has ""kept pace"" this is buzzword that doesn't actually mean anything. The economy has grown that is true.

Of course of countries want deals. They want their goods here. We don't have much clout with the major players to be honest and we are not going to get amazing deals.

The ""CANZUK"" Union. It may be popular here, but it will never be accepted by other countries. They have very strict rules on immigration and aren't going to like being flooded by us.

Due you have any figures for increase in wages and what sectors? I have seen nothing about this. "
773, I used to eat a meat rich diet and that was more than enough protein. My friend gave up up protein shakes once I pointed out how could get 50g very easily. 
774, Have you spoken to many Russian people about this. I have found them well informed about the causes of the rise in the cost of living and Putin is not a man loved by the people. 
775," I don't think they should be ripped off and nor do I want this, but that generation should keep future prosperity in mind when making political decisions. "
776, Seems like the NEC are doing what the people want and ending a classic under the table deal. 
777," Then they should have actually looked where their money was going. 

Most had no clue what was going on, and now want money which isn't there in many cases. "
778," No, peoples pension fund was spent on public services or invested into the economy.

The didn't save it they spent it. "
779, All of those countries were or are under the rule of evil dictators or groups. Nobody is crying out for Gaddafi or Saddam to come back. 
780," The Oxford Dictionary has this; The unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.

Not sure if any of your cases falls under this to be honest. "
781," No

How is it a terrorist act, it is an act of war and aggression.

Blowing in up apartment buildings is an act of terrorism.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_apartment_bombings "
782," Russia has committed more terrorist attacks in my lifetime by far.

The US has more bases in other countries than Russia but so does the UK. This is more due to countries not trusting Russia not to organise a coup.

The US did send troops to Afghanistan and Iraq. Why to fight against and enemy perceived or real. 

Russia is nice country full of cool people but the president is a symbol of evil in the world. "
783, He used journalists and papers like the daily mail instead. 
784," So we leave the EU which is good for according to the telegraph, but we are now seen as unreliable which is bad according to the telegraph.

Brexit will be a black mark on us for years to come. "
785," Lets hope it doesn't happen then.

 "
786, How many rubles is the correct rate for each comment now? 
787, Didn't he protect his mother's jewish doctor during the holocaust or am I mistaken? 
788, Thanks for you information. 
789, Are you not a Trump supporter? 
790, Thanks for you answer. 
791, Thank you for this information. 
792, Do you not think that controlling the start of conversations could be valuable to do? 
793," So you don't consider there to be any Russian ""bots to be operating on here? "
794," Do you think that these Russian ""bots"" don't exist or aren't active in this sub? "
795," Looking through some posts I see people talking about conspiracies, people from both sides of the political divide arguing.

One question is who is Russian ""bot""? I use the word ""bot"" in quote marks because I don't think most of them would be AI, but rather people being paid to post.

Has this sub been hijacked by a government power or am I just being paranoid?
  
(Edit) Thanks for the answers guys. The fact my question is at 0 with 43% upvotes is also for informative. "
796," You are not a centrist leaning left, even my american standards.

Supporting Trump pushes you way out of the centre. 

You seem to be agitating on a sub about conspiracies and trying to divert attention.   "
797," Finding a teacher would be the number one step.

I would look for a chinese tv program. You will pick up natural language common words and when they are used. "
798," Of course a regulation which opens up the markets and allows customer to see what a stockbroker is really doing, scares some people.

With Trump in the whitehouse expect some dodgy bankers to leave the city and hide in New York.

 "
799," The reasons for holding another referendum;

1 ""The will of the people"" This stupid term has been thrown about constantly since the referendum. This is a choice made by the people and at the end of negotiations the people should be able to speak again. If we had voted to stay and the EU changed the goalposts we should have had another referendum.

2 The average leaver will not be happy with what they are getting. There will be lots of this deal they dislike and the should have the choice to balance the benefits in their eyes.

3 If remain had won Farage would have kept piping on for years. This issue will continue to be open for years.

4 Leave know that people have cottoned on to the lies they were sold and are scared about the result. If you are silencing somebody then you are afraid of what they are saying.

5 The choice by brexiteers to devolve into children is awful. ""best of three"" or ""when do we stop"" and other stupid remarks. I am not sure remain would win an referendum, but the issue should be up for debate among the British people, not decided in some backroom. "
800," I don't know Korean, but find a good teacher, practise vocabulary on an app like duolingo and try to hear as much of it as you can from music or tv. "
801, I am an language teacher and watching tv is great for learning languages. 
802," The classic tale of two Englands. One is Big Gav fingering Stacy behind a kebab, the other is calculating the price of everyone's outfit and sipping cider. "
803, I am sure that was the case. 
804, It's all in the game. 
805, I read it was about women being distracted on their phones and driving off with the hose still in the car or some sexist bullshit like that. 
806," I'll bite.

First the Jewish religion would just be a myth. A relic of a bygone age.

Churchill would be viewed as an alcoholic warmonger, threatening the world's piece.

The Americans as a pacifist money loving weaklings.

The last of the slavs of the east would be dead by now and probably viewed as weak deserving to be whipped out by the superior Aryans. "
807, Do you know why people started this? 
808," She shaved a few days before. 

Stubble and penis don't mix. "
809," It will change, when I don't know. "
810, Relieves back pain. 
811, The army tested me. 
812, The drifting towards WW3. 
813," Got drunk and climbed a tree, goodbye phone. "
814," Money or card out before you are asked.

When looking for a fast queue follow men.

Ask the staff about offers, most will tell you what is really good value. "
815," The test done to check people's English are a lottery.

Maybe your nurse or an engineer working on a building, might not know enough English to avoid killing people.  "
816, England is knocking back the tenth pint and looking for a fight. 
817, I would put most leavers in the fruitcake category I am afraid. 
818, Unfortunately the leave side is quite fractured and will end up fighting against itself before long. 
819, Tell that to the EU. 
820, I am not sure anybody who wanted freedom of movement voted leave. 
821, Give it a few more months and a few more giveaways in the negotiations. 
822," Except people voted to end freedom of movement, which is tied to to the single market. "
823, Are you me? 
824," Nothing can be wrapped up quickly. This will take years and years to settle.

The fact that the government and it's party are disagreeing, should tell you a lot about how this will work. The end result will make everyone unhappy.

The brexiteers will still be under the control of the EU ""dirty foreigners"" will still be here. Remainers will be annoyed because we lose our say in the future of the EU. "
825, Do you want to stay in the single market and let the EU have a major influence on your life. 
826, The Pope is also still Catholic in recent news. 
827," The world changed and they have been left behind.

But note this is not a modern thing. Social morals went in the 60s and 70s. Economic morals went in the 80s. These people want a world which is long gone. "
828," What a difference a year makes.

She is now viewed as weak and unsteady.

The single market is a goal of the tories.

The EU has called all the shots and we are powerless to stop them.

The Brexiteers are starting to realize that they were lied to and the tories are not going to do what the people voted for. "
829," I did read a reliable source on the internet about the average ages of different arms of the soviet army in May 1945.

Unfortunately I didn't bookmark it but it said the average age of a rifleman was 45. "
830," Can you like a source to this Merkal stuff please?

Those countries are corrupt and have problems now because of this. "
831, Look at previous threads on here saying it is down and we can't go back. 
832," Since 2008 that graph is not looking good. He did help the rise that started under Yeltsin continue with a stable government, but he should have left in 2008 and not come back. "
833," Lets go through your points.

1 Oh my god the germans are invading Europe again. The army would be European it can't go around forcing people to integrate. The army would exist to make Putin wet his pants.

2 While I don't want us to join the Euro, it is not failing by any standard and with Trump in the white house could become a very important currency. The Euro does benefit Germany over other countries, but it does not fuck over the south.

3 Right now we are being ruled over by the most incompetent, useless and untrustworthy bunch of crooks we have had in a long time. How is this different from a democratic European Parliament?

  "
834," You may be surprised.

It takes the wind out of people's sails who think Brexit is in the bag. It gives us options and freedom, which are never bad. "
835," No that is untrue.

The priority is ensuring our way of life is not subverted by Putin. This is the number one we have to do.

Iraq is nothing like Crimea, we never annexed Iraq, when never sent our troops in disguises and we never shot down passenger airplanes. "
836," I lived in Russia and even they are more upbeat than the average brit.
 "
837," I am a Remainer, but I agree with your point.

If somebody changes the goalposts then any referendum is pretty worthless. "
838," Depends on two things

1 How the negotiations go. If the Eu keep hammering the tories, then support for Brexit will erode.

2 How long the tories can stay in power.     "
839," Theresa May is the number one cause of most peoples problems real or imagined.

How she gets away with it I don't know. "
840," It is harder to promise good things, than bad.

The problem was people tried to silence Farage and UKIP. If you stop someone from speaking it means you are scared of what they are saying.

Brexit seems to be a rebellion into nothingness. People don't like how it works now and will through it all away for something new good or bad. "
841, I am lucky I guess. I am working class and have a thick estuary accent. The point is people are starting to think about their future and what affect they have on it. 
842," The point is remain needs to explain to the manin the street what he will lose.

My brother voted to leave, after 5 minutes talking I persuaded him why he is wrong.

My dad on the other hand voted because he is becoming a daily mail reader. Common sense and reason are lost to him now. "
843," If anyone puts a number on the side of the bus they will be destroyed. Leave will have to come up with new lies, all of the old ones have been proved wrong.

if leavers are dumb rascist you can't change their mind, don't try. Call them what they are and try to seperate them from reasonable people. "
844," Anton Chekov was asked what Russia would look like in a hundred years, he said ""people will drink and steal"".

This problem has always existed in Russia, but it was the same in so many countries which have changed.

Russian people do have a lot of ""Old fashioned"" view, but aren't so different from you or I. The reason modernism doesn't exist in Russia is because Putin has hindered it. "
845," The generation of old people now is a different breed. I am not against everything the tories do, but I am against what this generation wants. "
846," 59% downvoted some people don't want to hear good news.

 "
847," Great post.

My biggest problem on him is his attitude towards Russia. Do you think he can improve in this area? "
848, The special interest are an evil which doesn't seem to be easily slayed. The problem is Brexit will allow these people to change the country and steal a wole load of money from people. 
849," If we leave and it is a great success people will have to shut up.

The problem is leaving will damage the country and people will look to our neighbours and think about what could have been. "
850," His ruthless, but I am not sure about smart.

He became mayor of St Petersburg and then President bacuse people thought he was a Yes man. He didn't get it through guile or intellect.Once he became president he turned on some of his backers and crushed his opponents. He has let the country stagnate and corruption flourish.

On the world stage he has managed to become enemy number 1 for every democratic government. He has gained a few scraps of land for this price.

If he were smarter he would be in a much better position now. "
851, People had to much faith in the man on street. The fight would be dirty on both sides if it happened again.  
852," The DUP for one have a huge undeserved say on what happens. The are people in the government who want a certain future for britian and this is how they are trying to get it.

Look at the tory rebels who fought for a chance to look at the deal at the end.

If we have to leave I want our brightest and best planning our future not the morons we have now. "
853," If something happens that could cause the people change their minds I would support a third referendum.

I just hate hearing ""the will of the people"" when it means nothing, without a second referendum.

 "
854," Leave were bad last time, but another referendum would see them destroyed I feel.

IDS had already gone to the backbenchs and I would love to see Borsi disappear the or to prison. "
855, At the moment the whole negotiating is being down by a week government beholden to special interests. It should really be a coalition effort. With all majoy political parties sending someone. 
856, I think the tide has turned on their way thinking. People look at Trump and others of his ilk and now see what it leads to. 
857," Mob rules strikes again.
 "
858, A second one would give the opinion of people who are aware of the process and the real reults it would incur. 
859," This issue will take a long time to settle down, but if we leave then it will never stop.

People actually now seem to be talking about issues. "
860," I think the tories are screwing the country up for a long time. i don't want us to join the Euro either, but I can't see that happening for a long time. 

I'd rather be a leading member of a big fish than a little minow on the world stage. "
861," The vote was not split evenly by age. Young people heavily favoured staying, old people wanted to leave.

I am not saying kill the elderly, but in a few years the ""Will Of The People"" may be completely different. "
862," If the people vote to leave again then most Remainers will ever leave the country or shut up and wait for a few years, only oopening their mouths to say ""I told you so"". "
863, Execpt noboday voted for what we are now getting. If that idiot Farage is agreeing with me you know the tories are up to no good. 
864, Demographics will tell a different story. 
865," Why is federalisation not in our best interests?
 "
866," According to brexiteers 51% to 49% is enough of a majority to change the country.

If there were another referendum, any lies team leave say will be cut to peices. They can't pretend that it will be free and not painful anymore. "
867," It depends on your view of the EU.

if you view it as an evil organisation bent on world domination and kicking puppies, you will see this.

By leaving we will have no say and the EU will affect more areas of our lives. 

If we stay in we have to be listened to and the voices have to be heard. "
868," I doubt it. Europe has been a hot button topic for years and was ignored, look at the mess we are in now. 

One of the reason the EU is happy we are going, is beacuse we won't be able to block what they want anymore.

If we stay in governments will have to tred very lightly around this issue.

 "
869," I think the opinion polls are organised by the government. The company that do them did have a reputation for being unbiased, but I am not sure that is true now.
 "
870," I wonder if her arguing with the protester who pied Murdoch, was sanctioned by Bejing? "
871," A second referendum would put the issue to bed for a long time.

If leave wins then we go out and negotiate with a strong mandate.

If Remain wins we stay in, but make sure the people are listened to when it comes to Europe.  "
872," I lived in Russia for a while. 

There are three opinions on the him;

1 Most people don't care and are happy being ignorant.

2 A large number of people hate him and want him dead.

3 A small group of people either profit from him or believe the propaganda and thus like him. "
873, What address can I send you twenty rubles to? 
874, Putin is not some all powerful god in Russia. He could lose control very quickly. 
875," The sanctions have had a huge affect on him, don't think that they have not weakened him. "
876," I have actually found something different. Stupidity is equal across all groups, but attitudes are different.

I have met so many working class people who are happy in their ignorance. Most of them know they are uninformed and don't care. Most middle class at least pretend to have an interest in the world.
This means that you can have a discussion  with them at least. "
877," Some polls say yes, some say no. People like Brenda are fools and have no part of this discussion. "
878, I have broke up with a girl for owning a horse. She was showing me photos on her phone. After the millionth horse i knew I was breaking up with her. 
879," Because it looks likely that it will be a Labour Lib coalition in power.

Actually very few people have changed their minds. The country is still split 50/50. Some undiecded have joined the remian camp, but that is it. That means half the country don't wont this to happen and want another vote. "
880," Why is it unlikely ?

The vote could go either way and looking at the polls for the next parliament it looks like we will be having one.
 "
881, It won't be overturned. We will have another referendum and follow that vote. 
882," I am a Remainer, but soft Brexit is a stupid idea.

We gain nothing we don't already have, but lose so much.

Nobody voted for this. Every brexiteer I have spoken to wants a hard Brexit. "
883," You flair says Libertarian. Why not follow this ideology?

 "
884," They voted for something stupid because they could.


I am working class, but I understand why politicians ignore a lot of people. There are huge number of working class people who are thick. They don't understand how life works or the affect of their actions.

Saying that, there huge numbers of stupid middle class people. They barely understand the world, but they integrate and are involved with others which rubs off on them.

Most people on both sides didn't not have a clue what they were voting for. But if Brexit is as bad as I imagine, it will be the folks at the bottom who will pay the price again. "
885, It will be a tax holiday I feel. 
886," Looks like some people are worried about about losing access to tax havens.

Their solution is to make Britain a tax haven. The whole piece seems to be making the case that these poor innocent bankers have their money trapped abroad and just want to bring it back and invest it. The more is there because of a scam 1 trillion pounds stolen from the people of the UK.

I have a better idea. Tax all money going to tax havens at a flat 5% goodbye deficit.

 "
887," People don't want wars or discrimination. 

The reason the far right has made progress around the world is simple: The Great Recession. When times are hard extreme political groups always gain popularity. 

Brexit will cause a backlash no matter what. The country is split down the middle and any choice will cause problems. "
888," Far right leaders never listen, they demand people listen to them. "
889," If somebody is stupid enough to join a far right party, they will find an excuse anyway. "
890," Teresa has proved to better than hanging than anyone thought. This government is completely useless at everything, except at staying in power.

It will collapse, but when I can't tell you when.  "
891," I see the plan as follows;

1 Wait for the government to implode.

2 Smash the tories in election, but still have a hung parliament 

3 Hope that the Lib Dems get enough seats to form a coalition

4 Reverse Brexit as part of the coalition deal.

 "
892," When you have the tories at their worst versus an organisation which is meant to be a fair future minded, the choice can be quite simple.

I don't love everything the EU does, but Brexit has shown them to be organised, pragmatic and willing to listen to the countries they represent

The tories are the opposite. Completely all over the place, dogmatic and willing to ignore the 49% who voted against this. "
893," The reason is because we know what we are getting if we stay, if we leave almost anything could happen.

Trying to predict the next ten years after Brexit is impossible. "
894," I am 5'4"" and shit happens. 

Do you what you want. I used to get annoyed about things like this, but I matured and it doesn't bother me now. If you want to date people who you like, do it. "
895, It takes a long time to create any army out of nowhere. We would have lost before the population will have been mobilized.  
896," There is an argument that they aren't a strong military piece of equipment, but they still have a lot of use in power protection.

In some situations they can be easily knocked out, but not cheaply or by any army. "
897," As much as I love that speech, I feel we are going to need a strong army in the future. "
898," I think we will have to disagree.

I feel it is another back handed way for the government to collect taxes, but I understand you don't feel that way. "
899," 1 Bingbongistan is not a real country.

2 Other countries will not allow us to go around nuking the world. "
900, None of those things involve the government. Name area in which you have to pay the government for an essential service. 
901," More effective?

They have been used once.

You will have two choices end the world or surrender. "
902," There is no choice.

You want a degree you have to pay. You can choose not to go, but you don't get a degree. For a huge amount of professions there is no choice.

It is a tax on people who have gone to university. "
903," I may not like the tories, but I didn't not expect huge cuts in 2010 while a war was being fought in Afghanistan.

They aren't a pro armed forces party. "
904," I see it as a new tax.

It is a tax on higher education framed in a different way. "
905," They don't have aircraft carriers or nuclear weapons. 

These are hugely expensive, but allow our country to have a place on the world stage. If we get rid of them and make our army a force that can defend the British isles then do it. No more death by a million cuts. "
906," The man is being borrowed, which covers the costs. Now if the money is not paid back, it won't disappear a future government will have to pay it back. "
907," How much will you pay back in the end do you think?

If people don't pay it back, we end screwing the next generation and the can will be kicked further down the road. "
908," None for me in real life. 

On the internet I remind people what their politicians have said. You like Trump, what do you think of this stupid thing he said etc. "
909," That is why I never joined. I went and passed the briefing, then the tories cut the army in 2010 and I went elsewhere. "
910," Any more cuts and we should do away with the forces. They are becoming a paper tiger, why waste money if they won''t be able to do anything. "
911, According to some of my old teachers you had to go speak to people at your local government or education to get some money. 
912," Not sure how old your Nan is, but after there was a lot of support from local government to help students got to university during the 50s.

The fact is we need more people to go Uni, because there are so few other jobs for people. Manufacturing and industry have declined. The government can afford this cost and would benefit from paying it. The reason it doesn't is because it would not benefit this generation of old people.

The voters in the 70s and 80s should have complained or done something to make sure the money was saved. They didn't, nor did they have lots of children so it would be paid for by this. They knew they were a large generation, but didn't care enough to think about the pensions.

I am not one of those people saying cull the old. But they should pay for their mistakes. The government needs to start thinking about the economy in the long term, not just until the next election. "
913," Did tests and passed, but got an injury which delayed it. 

My country cut the military budget soon after, so I decided against it. "
914," The Great Escape.

Classic Sad ending, but it really happened. "
915," Not Tajik. I have taught people from both of these groups though. There is a little animosity, a sort of home pride thing. There are some big issues though things like the Aral sea which they really disagree. 

To be honest their views on other Muslim countries or Russia were far more interesting. "
916, He cancelled because he is a child who can't take criticism. 
917," The fact is many resources have been used up to provide this bounty. This situation was caused by many reasons and current generations will be worst off.

Look at university fees. These are a burden and will harm the future prospects of these people.

The economy has been set as a giant ponzi scheme. This generation of old people seem to think it was all their hard hard work and skill.

My grandmother used to trot out the old ""I paid my pension so I deserve this"". Except she didn't, there is no pension pot. That money is spent on everyday services. These people are using private pension system or generous public pensions. Private pension have benefited from a boost in stock market. Shame this has not been spread to the rest of the economy.

Public pensions are in an awful state due to nobody saving for this issue.  "
918," After living in Russian, I can't recommend it enough. "
919," I know a few people like this. One of my friends was a fireman all his life, retired with a house and a good pension. His view seems to be screw everyone else now.

I think the part will be better off without some of these people. "
920, From my knowledge is the anti EU sentiment mainly from their leaders. A group of suspiciously pro Putin anti democratic idiots. 
921, Where will these people go? 
922," You didn't cause the sexual harassment, the arseholes at you job did.

I always ask myself why catcalling or general harassment are done. Is it ever successful. The truth is yes. I have seen it done in front of me and a lot of relationships start this way. "
923," When you only have one.

When my last laptop died I was completely fucked until I got a replacement. I almost lost my job, missed out on some private work and almost went crazy with nothing to do for a week. 

Now I have two computers. A good one and a cheap back up to keep me going. "
924," My brother's fiancee caught me jerking one off at 2AM. Luckily I had enough time to get rid of the porn, but she knew what I was doing. "
925," Most of humanity is dead. The world is ruled by a handful of super rich people and hordes of machines that keep these people alive.

Most people are genetically engineered, but some people have started to lose the traits that make them human. 

The episode would deal with what happens when people are surrounded by people with no personality and how there will be no happy ending. "
926," I like feminism, but living in a country ,without it in the western sense has changed my views.

Most guys do need to change their attitude, but most crap that women deal with is caused by women and has nothing to do with men.

After seeing a few different cultures there are somethings about western feminism I don't like.

 "
927," Yes, but there was an update either way i would recommend using it. "
928, Play V3 or at least use the books.  
929," What planet does she live on?

The only option she has about Trump is to ignore the subject until he is gone.  "
930, Every time I go by Chelyabinsk station I think of what happened there. 
931," I live with a girl who did this a lot. My reaction was to stare at the ceiling, until she either did something or let me look. "
932, Ask him when his Y chromosome is getting delivered. 
933, Tamiya paints do suck ass though. 
934," He had both those ports before. Syria has loved him for a long time. 

He is not a genius, but a rat climbing to the top of a sinking ship. Desperately trying to keep what he has as his power slips from his grasp. "
935, So the people in Eastern Europe should have been happy to stay under the boot of Fascism in 1939 and been raped and killed so the soviets in 1945 couldn't do it? 
936," The allies didn't get steamrolled as soon as the fighting started. From September 1939 to May 1940 is 8 months. The armies were mobilized and tanks and armaments were rolling of the production lines.

Germany would not have gone after Russia first unless they had several key advantages. Like more countries supporting them. "
937, No country in 1939 could realistically have annexed the world. WW2 was two alliances fighting each other. 
938, This is why Evil always fails in the end. The people can't stay together because they can't trust or help each other. 
939, I think Nazi Germany was a hell of a lot worst. 
940," Up to the Elbe. In the end the east of Europe is now free, but if the nazis had one it would have been a different story. "
941, From the realpolitik it would have been awful. If the allies had not  helped Poland in 1939 we would have lost all creditably around the world.  
942," While we did lose our place in the sun, I can't see any argument to why we should not have fought.

Hitler would have taken over Europe if not the world. Our way of life would have disappeared and we would be in a much worst position now.  "
943, No problem. 
944, 400 rubles an hour. I work in a city. I have a TEFL. Some of my colleagues are native and some aren't. 
945, Are you wearing two plaid shirts? 
946," I work in the centre of the country. I can't remember how I found the job. My salary depends on how much I work, but it is ok. In Russian there are not many Private schools outside Moscow so I work in a private language centre. I am from the UK and I picked Russia for a bit of adventure. "
947," I am teacher in Russia and this is my second year.

I like the country, the students and the lifestyle.

I don't like the way business is done and sometimes the weather.

I work in a private school.

The students all of ages. Compared to other countries they are excellent.

My boss is  not the best guy, but along is I do everything ok, I have no problems. My co-workers are excellent, good fun and hard working.

The teaching culture at the school is pretty hands off which is good.

I got hired via an online application.

Pay is not bad. Low compared to previous jobs, but living expenses are pretty negligible and I am saving money.

If you have any question feel free to ask.  "
948," I love it when my students ask me ""Are you boring teacher?"" "
949," This the bane of my life.

I tell me student it wasn't a funny wedding it seems every week. "
950," Trump is an arsehole.

But for me Ford in the book is a you said a revolutionary and that is why he was propelled to the position of god. If the book was written today I feel Steve Jobs would be that person. "
951, For me last year was pretty cold -30 in January. 
952," Lol. 

Snow is nicer than rain. "
953, One of the reasons I left. 
954, I miss Barcelona. I had 154 days no rain. :( 
955, It does. 
956," Not exactly true, there is always one drunk guy in a bar who knows 10 words in English and tries to use them on me. 

There was once announcment in English at the airport, but it was wrong. :(
 "
957," Today it rained in my city, why did I leave England?

This winter in Russia is just crap. "
958, For me it would be Steve Jobs. For so many people he is beyond an Idol. 
959," The fact that as a man so much is available to me.

I can do some many things, or say what I want. People don't really seem to care or if they do they think you are an arsehole. 

I have seen so many girls either not do something or get called out for doing what they want or being who they are. 

Women seem to have to have this internal mechanism or what is acceptable to do or say at any moment. I know we all have to follow rules of society, but by and large they are pretty fair. It is this weird thing where a girl won't say what she thinks or do something she like because she will be judged. "
960," I saw the same thing. 

""Our position"" means what I am saying now subject to change. "
961, The new expanded ports would not be cheap and I feel this would end up being passed onto the companies. 
962," Thank you for a good detailed answer.

I wanted to know the outlines of your views on a couple of topics where, what is good for the country versus what is good for individuals clash. "
963," I always found that the lowest levels of the company, usaully earnt their money back within a few weeks. "
964, But remember you are a pervet and a creep for looking at somebodies profile. /s 
965," There are some people on this sub who wildly throw out insults and call names, but we should take action to stop this, not get ride of left wingers.

Saying this we do have people on this sub who are far right or strangely Pro Putin and they should not be protected from what others think.  "
966," I agree. If somebody posts a well thought out post or cutting jibe, I will read it. Unfortunately that doesn't seem to happen so often. "
967, Can I ask about your views on taxes and surveillance? 
968," For me the grunts were always the best investment. A minimum wage employee is still one of the most useful tools any workplace can have. I always viewed the people I worked with not as an expenditure, but as a tool.

The guys on the bottom do add up, but normal some valued is gained from them. The problem are always bad ideas or costly projects. Has the ever been a company that has gone bankrupt because
 of too many guys at the bottom. "
969," Chill Dude.

You said you would accept the vote.

This sub is more left wing then the nation, but very few areas of life accurately represent the current mood of the nation. I want good discussion on here, but blaming left wing members is not the solution. 

 "
970," If you work in a retail environment you realize that 200 pounds of waste is nothing. We lost that everyday just on food in a small shop.

Labour costs always seem high, but the grunts on the ground are cheap. When we used to shoot the shit about this at work I always times the hours by 3x at least to cover other costs. The calculations we used to make blew our mind on how money is spent in the retail business. "
971," So the torys got 42% of the vote DUP got 0.9 and Ukip got 1.8%. So right wing parties got 44.7 % of the vote and left wing parties got 55.3 % of the vote.

Happy now. "
972, Pretty funny. 
973, Not looked at any polls or who people voted for in the house of commons? 
974," For the country no. 

For the people yes.

Watch as prices rise in supermarkets and jobs are lost in industries that export. "
975," From my time working in a supermarket. 

Next to nothing. 

The money the wasted was huge, but working out how to save it is difficult. Cutting hours and wages is measurable solution but not at all efficient. "
976," The sub is more left wing, but so is the country. You are portraying the problem as innocent tory supporters being downvoted into oblivion.

Except that is not really true look at the the threads. The people who are being downvoted are suspicious  Pro Putin accounts or guys who post in the red pill or the_d. "
977, Not sure why you are getting downvoted. 
978," Most people I chat with are my cilents and normal people, like taxi drivers.

Do you have links to any polls?

Good for you for voting against him. "
979, I disagree. The day Putin looks weak is the day his enemies will remove him from power. A week vote count would sink him. 
980," I have a lot of time with russian people and the level of support for him is not great. Most people don't care what the newspapers or TV says I also find.

Vote falsification is a huge problem I have spoken to many people who commited voter fraud. "
981," Do you have any evidence?
 "
982," This is correct, but is being down voted. "
983, Interesting article. But most people will not check their links or sources I feel. 
984, Wait until you see what she can do next year. 
985," What shadow ministry did Blair hold before becoming leader?

Home Secretary.  "
986, That was going to be one of my picks. 
987," Are you a Russian troll?

An honest question.  "
988, Sounds like some of the people on this sub have been calling in. 
989, One of the funniest things I have seen in a long time. 
990, You can test my Englishness. 
991," As much as sometimes I would agree with some of the policies, they always fucked it up by being tories.

For example the bedroom tax makes a bit of sense, until you see that there is a huge shortage of 1 bedroom council flats. "
992," Look at some of the people commenting in this thread. There are people here definitely trying to deflect. 
And some people who are from Russia. "
993," Read the report and see for yourselves.

1015, Look at the chinese numbers. 
1016," The horse  was almost completely removed from the british army. The BEF landed with no horses in 1940.

There was a British Cavalry Division in Palestine, but it never really saw action. The guys in the desert were pretty switched on and the 7th Armoured Division were very effective until they were scattered to the wind. "
1017," Yes. 

Do you research people.

1023, Hi I live here in Barcelona and speak a little Spanish and I am just interested if anyone wants to go out for a drink and laugh one night. 
1024," I was in a club in Barcelona, just drinking and partying. As I am using the urinal, the seediest looking guy comes over trying to sell me pills. I thought that by the look of him the drugs will be amazing or crap. So I partook and knocked back the mystery pill. Down on the dance floor the world becomes awesome I spot a magical beard working it's way through the crowd. I say to the girl I am with "" you recognize him he's Jason Sudekis???"" I try to explain with the few brain cells I left who is, but my friends just think I am tripping. So I decided to go talk to him and introduce him to my friends and solve all the confusion.  
With huge pupils I stumble over to him shouting at the top of my lung ""Jason Jason Jason"" He vainly tries to escape me as I blather on about films he's not in and finally tells me to ""fuck off"". Which I listened to and comprehend enough so he didn't have to force me.    "
