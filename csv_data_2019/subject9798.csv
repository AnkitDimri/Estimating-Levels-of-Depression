0," Nudity may not be sexualized, but porn still is  "
1, They probably work with a lot of nude models. Nudity isn't inherently sexual to them anymore.  
2," Oh, absolutely, it was _jeb and dinnerbone and the rest that made it actually good, but people credit Notch for it because he made it initially.  "
3," In the base game, yeah. They seemed to finally have a good budget for voice actors in the DLCs though. Pretty much every character in them has a unique, fantastic voice actor.  "
4, *cough*femaleskyrimguard*cough* 
5," Lol, I did not intend that pun at all, that's great.  "
6," It's not rigorous at all, but it is useful for getting to know yourself, and getting advice for the struggles you're likely to face.  "
7," IIRC, Notch (creator of Minecraft) feels the same way. He wants to do more, but the expectations of others for another blockbuster game are just too high because of the success of Minecraft. He'd been working on a game called 0x10^c , but because of the extreme pressure by fans to make it the next Minecraft, and the fact that he doesn't need the money, it's just a personal project, he abandoned it, and now it'll never see any kind of release.  "
8," Just filled it out. I should really see a psychologist, I had way too many 2s and 3s. "
9," The best way I can describe my thinking is that I think not in words or pictures or speech, but concepts - general, abstract concepts. Try as I might, I can't change this, and because of it, my thoughts don't translate easily into words. It sounds like you're the same way.  "
10, INB4 Undertale 
11, Got a source for that?  
12," There is recorded proof (besides the bible) that a person named Jesus of Nazareth gained quite a following in that time period. Such a fact makes no claims to his supposed miracles, only to his existence. Jesus did exist. The things people claim he did are bullshit.  "
13," One, time and a place dude. Two, I am an atheist, but Jesus the person did exist.  "

15," A teacher had a heart attack during class. He was taken to a hospital, but died later that same day. He was middle-aged, in perfect health, it was completely unexpected.  "
16," Fuck you, Caitlyn. She wants so badly to be the face of the trans community, but she is such an awful person, on top of being this much of a moron.  "
17," JFC, it just doesn't make sense to me why people care that she is trans. If they didn't know she was trans, they'd just think she's the gorgeous woman that she is.  "
18," Opinions aren't relevant here. What are bring presented here are facts, whether you like them or not.  "
19," If you don't care, then why do you keep commenting on it?  "
20, What makes you think that?  
21," Now I'm unsure of where you're unsure. So again, what is it about having a penis that is so important to being a man?  "
22," There's a lot of research that disagrees with you. Yes, gender usually matches genetalia, but not always. What is it about having a penis that is so important to being a man?  "
23," Say what you will about his content, he is a great person.  "
24, i'll take the death thanks 
25," A trans man is someone who is biologically female, but is a man.  "
26," I'm guessing this makes it so that you can't drive, right?  "
27," Downvotes do literally nothing on YouTube. G+ only supports +1, so the clicking thumbs down button does nothing except turn it blue, that's it.  "
28, They're trying so hard to be edgy. It'd be funny if it wasn't disappointing.  
29," Not just known, (0+)K is the coldest temperature possible ( is defined to be a non-specific, extremely small number, used here because true 0K is impossible). Below that, the concept of temperature just doesn't make sense.  "
30,  
31," I'm bi, and though I agree with you to an extent, there's a time and a place. The matter of bi erasure is typically confined to LGBT spaces. Right now, trans people are being attacked by the government directly. Now is the time to band together and fight this, and resolve internal issues later.  "
32, The acronym is the least important part of the whole thing. Most people who aren't technically represented in the acronym LGBT are still just fine using it to represent the whole community.  
33," I'm bi, and though I agree with you to an extent, there's a time and a place. The matter of bi erasure is typically confined to LGBT spaces. Right now, trans people are being attacked by the government directly. Now is the time to band together and fight this, and resolve internal issues later.  "
34," Hell yeah. I may be cis, but I will fight for trans people till the very end. This adminstration will go down as the biggest failure in US history.  "
35," When I was 5 or so, I fell out of my bed and onto the corner of an open dresser drawer. I bled like crazy. The scar is still very prominent 16 years later.  "
36," There is real science behind the gender spectrum, not the otherkin bullshit.  "

42," national political figure

Gee, I wonder.  "
43," These are shaping up to be the first legitimate elections we've had in years. Finally, people are actually showing up to vote. If that means that Democrats take power, then Republicans should never have been in power to begin with.  "
44," ""Despite everything, it's still you.""  "
45," ...they do. That's what the API doc says, that why OP is having a problem.  "
46," You could take them with tight clothes. Still don't post the pictures obviously, but to keep your own track of progress.  "
47, a + b(a + b(a + b(a + b...))) but yes.  
48," Dude, fuck off. OP saw a joke they liked and wanted to share it.  "
49," She used to claim to be bi, but last I've heard she's happily seeing another woman

That doesn't mean she's not bi, that means she's in a committed relationship. Just because she's not seeing a guy right now doesn't mean she wouldn't if she wasn't committed. It's exactly the same way you're still straight when in a relationship; you still find other girls attractive, but you're committed so you don't pursue them.  "
50," It's still indoctrination. Even if they're not consciously listening to what they're saying, they're still saying it, and it's going to have a subconscious effect.  "
51, I see you're a man of culture.  
52," As crappy as they both are, now  then.  "
53, Sadly? The dev has been working on it for more than four years! He deserves the money for it.  
54," It would kinda defeat the purpose of scam baiting, but it would be fun to watch.  "
55," The whole point of the phonetic alphabet is that none of the words sound like any of the others. None of them are remotely similar to Sierra, so if you hear a word that sounds at all like Sierra, even if it's garbled, you know it's Sierra, and thus an S.  "
56," Help! I'm about to turn, I can't fight it! I can't- I ca...

57, [The finished product](https://i.imgur.com/Ozfp5uR.png) 
58," I am bi but not pan because my homosexuality, while undeniably existent, is significantly less than my heterosexuality. That means that though I can be attracted to basically anyone, which fits bisexuality, gender does make a difference to me, which does not fit the definition of pansexuality.  "
59," It most certainly is not a small step! Figuring out who you are, and having the courage and strength to tell the world is an incredible step!  "
60, What you described fits my definition of pansexual perfectly.  
61, Goodbye.  
62," I was eventually just able to read it straight off. I couldn't just read the name, but real words somehow just made sense. I finally did figure out the rules and could read the name, but that felt really weird.  "

65," In that case, I'm very happy for him - he's done what I yet can't.  "
66," He didn't ""get over it"", he's fighting it. If he's anything like me, he's still extremely uncomfortable, but tying his best to have a good time anyway.  "
67," Punished for our sins by whom? By a god? By the judicial system? By our peers? Forever, or proportionately? I selected yes, but the ambiguity of that question made it difficult to answer.  "
68," All the rest are entirely true, breaking them undeniably would be erasure, but that one seems more like it's describing the relationship than the person. Just my 2. "
69," Eh, I'm not so sure about the bottom left one. I get the sentiment, but it seems too picky. Yes I'm bi, but I would have no problem with someone saying I'm in a gay relationship. I would likely even say it myself (though I've never been in such a relationship). "
70," It looks like it's supposed to accept passwords that are at least of length 8, and that contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number. The number part doesn't work because it's true for numbers and letters, but if that were fixed, I don't see how this would fail (aside from any code standards).

It won't ever return false, but it will return null, which is falsy so eh, good enough. If will detect capitals anywhere, then lowercases anywhere, then numbers anywhere. If it doesn't find any of those, it doesn't bother to check the rest. I can't think of any test cases that would fail.  "
71, His concern is probably that it's not profitable or something. He can't imagine something non-profitable being good.  
72," Just yesterday, I was driving through a monsoon, roads on the verge of being completely flooded, and someone right in front of me tried to switch out of the far left lane a bit too fast. They started hydroplaning, spun out, 360'd twice, and finally ended up perfectly lined up in the far right lane, and just kept going like nothing happened. Had I been 0.5 seconds ahead of where I was, he would've hit me. I eventually passed him, and maybe he was just in shock, but he looked completely unfazed, driving along as normal.  "
73," Srinivasa Ramanjan comes to mind. He is probably the best mathematical mind that the world has ever known, but (IIRC) he was born and lived in India's lower class. He was invited to Cambridge after being discovered and stayed there for a while, but he fell ill and died shortly after, when he was just 32. Had he lived longer or been discovered sooner, he could've revolutionized mathematics (more than he already did), on the same or a greater scale than the likes of Gauss, Euler, and Newton. His talents and potential were lost, just as those of Tesla.  "
74, And I hate every time they've used it. It all but ruins a great minor key song.

76," All of PewDiePie's videos have multiple million views, whereas T-Series is lucky to get 1 million. I'd say PewDiePie is still pretty safe at #1 for all metrics other than subs.  "
77, And provide an explanation if you can  
78," It's a lot like the Intermediate Value Theorem. If a real, differentiable function is negative at one point and positive at another, then it must be zero at at least one point between those two. It's easy to state and understand, and it's an incredibly obvious statement, but proving it is actually a bit of a nightmare.  "
79," A bullet vibrator. She had never used any kind of vibrator before, so it blew her mind. Now she never has sex or masturbates without it.  "
80," It's a big tell of untrustworthyness at the very least, even if they refuse to recognize it. It was a tell for her, too. Again, she would've been unspeakably better than Trump, but she would've been far from perfect.  "
81," Okay, no, let's not forget that that was a real, legitimate controversy. However, it's nowhere near as bad as Trump's.  "
82," If OP is asking how to open a file (which they might not be, they might know how to do that and were just asking about the matrix), then I assume they don't mean a proper matrix, and instead mean an array of arrays.  "
83," The second picture is enough. It shows the first line of this:

    (a+b)^2 = 4*(a*b/2) + c^2
    a^2 + b^2 + 2*a*b = 2*a*b + c^2
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2 "
84," Ugh, everyone suggesting all these libraries. This sub is meant to teach people how to use Python, not numpy, or other stuff like that, but the functionality of Python itself.

For a one liner, you could do this:

    [[val for val in line.split(',')] for line in open(file.csv).readlines()]

The first set comprehension could just be line.split(',') I think, but this lets you mess with each value if you want.

94," I'll stop mocking conservatives when they, and their policies and practices stop being something to mock. The fact is that the climate is changing, and the ungodly amount of greenhouse gasses we're dumping into the atmosphere is at the very least making it worse, even if not completely causing it, yet those in power care more about making a quick buck than the long-term survival of our species, not to mention almost every other species on this planet. Their idiocy would be laughable if it didn't have horrifying implications.  "

98," They probably wanted to save her first time saying ""I'm the Doctor"" for her first big ""I'm the Doctor, and here's how I'm gonna win"" moment.  "
99," Jodie Whittaker is great as The Doctor. The episode was meh. The pacing was off, the music was lackluster at best, the villain's character seemed uninspired. I hated Grace's death scene, the acting was frankly awful. 

It just didn't feel like Doctor Who, and that's not Whittaker's fault. "

103," I know it seems strange, but people being just generally competent, self-reliant, autonomous, etc. Something about watching people work on anything non-trivial without needing anyone's help gets me very interested in that person for some reason. I wouldn't say it gets me hard by itself, but it definitely makes me want to be.  "
104," That's true, but someone who can't draw can still appreciate a good drawing. People who hate math because of how it's taught won't appreciate the beauty of well done math because there are numbers and letters and oh god not again and zone out. If math were taught well, people would be able to appreciate it even if they couldn't do it themselves.  "
105," I get that this isn't the place to complain, but that title is deliberately making it seem like the gay penguins were in the wrong. The chicks biological parents were being neglectful, the gay penguins saved it. Someone who sees that and doesn't click might just think it's evidence against gay couples being parents: ""See, it doesn't even work in the wild!""  "
106," Okay, that's good and all, but that's less that 0.05% of his wealth. He could donate like 1%, $10M (assuming he has only $1B, he probably had much more) and solve the overall problem just like that.  "
107," The wording is bad IMO. It should say ""What so you think is the probability that your answer is correct?"" "
108," That's what real math is all about. People get the idea from school that math is just solving equations, but really it's all about this kind of creativity, just trying out new things, seeing what works, what doesn't, and what might end up being useful. Math is beautiful when you know how it's really done.  "
109, That dorky grin looks fantastic on Temmy.  
110," It blows my mind that term limits have never been imposed. Even when things were running smoothly, it just makes sense to make sure the same people don't have power for too long.  "
111," It's all about conservative vs liberal to you, isn't it? It doesn't matter what the viewpoint is, if a conservative is saying it, it's good, and if it's a liberal, it's Satan. You are part of the problem.  "

118," Yup. My friend and I used to jack off together a lot, sometimes jack each other off, and sometimes experiment with oral. We had no idea what we were doing (I didn't anyway, I don't know about him), but having done that really confused me for a while, because I thought I was straight, but I enjoyed doing that so way I gay? Turns out I'm bi, but it took me a long time to finally realize/accept it.  "

121," Serious question, what's your response to finding someone hot? For non-asexual people, I think it's usually a desire to have sex with that person. Do you just appreciate them and move on?  "

126, They should want the survey to ask as random of people as possible. That's how to get accurate results.

Abortion is not a good thing, it's not something one *wants* to have. I do however support the ability to choose to have one because the alternative would be worse, for the parent(s) and the child.  "
132, I am cis. I would kick this woman so hard.

137,  
138," I think anyone here should be able to figure it out easily: there isn't a continuous objective in Pokemon. In Mario, your goal is to get as far right as possible making your continuous value just how far right you are over how far right you need to get, but in Pokemon, your goal is to either gather all the Pokemon, or beat the elite four, depending on your inclination, and neither of those have any continuous value. You can have 3 Pokemon or 4 Pokemon, but not 3.5, and the elite four are either beaten or not, 0 or 1. Our current algorithms are based on constant improvement of this continuous value, so without such a value, we can't get a computer to beat the game.  "

141," I'm not really into the club scene so I haven't actually looked into it much, sorry. I did just find [this](https://www.gaytucson.com) though, hopefully that will help.  "
142," I strongly disagree. To me, bisexuality is attraction to more than one gender, not necessarily equally, and pansexuality is attraction regardless of gender, so attraction to every gender more or less equally. Neither say anything about attraction, or lack thereof, to trans people.  "
143," To make sure I understand, your definition of bisexual is basically pansexual minus trans people?

I am bisexual but not pansexual, and I would have no qualms whatsoever with having a trans partner. I am not pan because, though I am attracted to both men and women, my attraction to men is significantly less than my attraction to women. My understanding of pansexuality is attraction regardless of gender, but gender does matter to me, at least that little bit. 

But like I said, ""men and women"" is a simplification of the whole gender spectrum. Someone who is attracted to men and non-binary people but not women is just as bisexual as someone who is also attracted to women. 

The idea that bisexual people aren't pansexual because they don't like trans people is a gross oversimplification and generalization that should be scorned by all LGBT.  "
144," Well, when Notch was around it wasn't the biggest game ever, so he didn't put as much care into it. Then as it got bigger it got harder and harder to fix everything, so they just didn't until it all came to a tee recently and they had a whole bunch of long, technical updates to fix it all.  "
145," I feel the need to emphasize that I wouldn't really care about someone being trans. It's a complicated mess of a problem. I guess what I was talking about was pre-op people. For post-op trans people, I agree, there really is no excuse.  "
146," Tucson is the most liberal city in Arizona, so it's great by Arizona standards, but that's not a very high bar. There have been a few anti-LGBT street preachers, but that's about it. From what I've seen, normal people couldn't care less about people being LGBT.  "
147," I'm glad that the mods are trying to take action but it's upsetting that so many are still so prejudiced. I'd hoped that my post would make a difference, I'm sorry it doesn't seem to have. "
148," My first introduction to programming was on a TI-84 calculator. There is no single best place to start. That said, I suggest starting with Python. It is very close to natural language (you can read it in plain English), and it does as much or as little as you want, in that you can make a quick 10 line script to solve a tiny problem, or make a huge, multi-file, 10,000 line project to solve a big one. You won't get the best performance out of it, but it does a great job at introducing programming concepts while still being very useful and fun to use. After that, move over to Java or C# for high-level (far from the metal) programming, then C++ for mid-level, and C for low-level. If I remember correctly, most programmers use C++ because of it's great balance of speed and ease of use. "

157," Ack, I initially wrote that out describing trans men, I just forgot to update that part. Thanks. "
158," I agree with you entirely on not caring if someone's trans, but there are some that do care. By the way though, a trans woman (m2f) is someone who was assigned male at birth but identifies as female. And thanks, it took a long time to figure out how to word all of this properly. "
159," No one truly understands it. Like I said, it's like how not being attracted to Asian people isn't racist, it's just personal preference, and no one can particularly say why. "
160," I'm bi but not pan because my attraction to men is significantly less than my attraction to women. It's true that many people who identify as bi also fit the definition of pan, but I imagine most don't.  "
161," It took me way too long to figure out who the other idiot was. For the two others who didn't see it immediately, the motorcycle is driving on the wring side of the road.  "
162, That sounds INTense.  
163," First of all, we need to make the distinction between bisexuality and pansexuality very clear. If you already understand, you can skip this first paragraph. Bisexual people often describe themselves as being attracted to both men and women, but that is just a situationally convenient simplification. In truth, bisexual people experience attraction to more than one gender, just as someone who is bilingual speaks more than one language. A bisexual person might be attracted to men and non-binary people but not women, and would be just as bisexual as someone who was attracted to women too. However, bisexual people often experience the attractions to those different genders differently. As someone here once described their own experience, ""attraction to men is like ahh, but attraction to women is like ooh"" (which resonates with me perfectly). Pansexuality is an extension of bisexuality where the person is attracted to every gender more or less equally and in the same way. Just as all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, all pansexual people are bisexual, but not all bisexual people are pansexual. These definitions may not be perfect, but they should get the idea across. It also needs to be made clear that bisexuality is not inherently exclusive of trans people. Most bisexual people probably won't care about someone's equipment, so most bisexual people won't distinguish between cis people and trans people. However, some bisexual people might be attracted to men but not trans men. This (usually, though unfortunately not always) isn't transphobic, this is personal preference, just as someone might not be attracted to Asian people. I hope this is a sufficient explanation.

So to business. Though I myself am bisexual but not pansexual, I am subscribed to [/r/pansexual](https://www.reddit.com/r/pansexual) just to see the discussion that goes on there, and there was a thread there recently that disturbed me deeply, in which the OP says that they feel unwelcome in GSM (Gender and Sexual Minority, generalization of LGBTQIAetc) spaces. They say that many posts on here specifically are quite rude and generalizational toward pansexual people. For example, see [https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/940590/do\_we\_really\_need\_the\_word\_pansexual/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/940590/do_we_really_need_the_word_pansexual/). This point of this post is bourn out of a misunderstanding of pansexuality and its difference from bisexuality, but beyond that it is simply a rude thing to ask, especially in a community of people who are more likely to be only bisexual and not pansexual and thus possibly not fit to answer. Those who identify as pansexual do so because they feel that bisexual is not sufficient to describe how they feel, but pansexual is. That itself is reason enough for the word to exist.

Of course, those ignorant (meaning lacking knowledge, not stupid) bisexual people are hardly to blame for all the issues. The same misunderstanding exists in nearly all GSM spaces. This leads to a feedback loop, where people who misunderstand try to explain it to people who are asking, then those new people misunderstand too, and go on to misexplain it to even more people, until you end up with posts like [https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/99bppr/i\_need\_to\_vent\_about\_pansexuality\_and\_biphobia\_in](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/99bppr/i_need_to_vent_about_pansexuality_and_biphobia_in). The text of the post doesnt seem like that big a deal, but the way it was titled is problematic. Imagine if there was a post by a pan person entitled I need to vent about bisexuality. Doesnt seem right, does it? Maybe vent about biphobic pan people, or just biphobic people in general, but to generalize the venting to all pansexual people is completely unfair.

Fortunately, many posts and comments that are dismissive or insulting of pan people are rightfully removed by the mods, but the fact remains that those things were indeed posted. There are people in this community, and in GSM communities all over the spectrum that feel that way, and that is deeply disturbing to be. The GSM community as a whole is already put down enough by people outside it. We dont need infighting too. No GSM community should ever be that way toward any other. Were all here because of the people we love. Lets leave the hate behind and keep it about love.

Title: We need to talk about our how we interact with our pansexual cousins

Body:

First of all, we need to make the distinction between bisexuality and pansexuality very clear. If you already understand, you can skip this first paragraph. Bisexual people often describe themselves as being attracted to both men and women, but that is just a situationally convenient simplification. In truth, bisexual people experience attraction to more than one gender, just as someone who is bilingual speaks more than one language. A bisexual person might be attracted to men and non-binary people but not women, and would be just as bisexual as someone who was attracted to women too. However, bisexual people often experience the attractions to those different genders differently. As someone here once described their own experience, ""attraction to men is like ahh, but attraction to women is like ooh"" (which resonates with me perfectly). Pansexuality is an extension of bisexuality where the person is attracted to every gender more or less equally and in the same way. Just as all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, all pansexual people are bisexual, but not all bisexual people are pansexual. It also needs to be made clear that bisexuality is not inherently exclusive of trans people. Most bisexual people probably won't care about someone's equipment, so most bisexual people won't distinguish between cis people and trans people. However, some bisexual people might be attracted to men but not trans men. This (usually, though unfortunately not always) isn't transphobic, this is personal preference, just as someone might not be attracted to Asian people. I hope this is a sufficient explanation.

So to business. Though I myself am bisexual but not pansexual, I am subscribed to /r/pansexual just to see the discussion that goes on there, and there was a thread there recently that disturbed me deeply, in which the OP says that they feel unwelcome in GSM (Gender and Sexual Minority, generalization of LGBTQIAetc) spaces. They say that many posts on here specifically are quite rude and generalizational toward pansexual people. For example, see [https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/940590/do\_we\_really\_need\_the\_word\_pansexual/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/940590/do_we_really_need_the_word_pansexual/). This point of this post is bourn out of a misunderstanding of pansexuality and its difference from bisexuality, but beyond that it is simply a rude thing to ask, especially in a community of people who are more likely to be only bisexual and not pansexual and thus possibly not fit to answer. Those who identify as pansexual do so because they feel that bisexual is not sufficient to describe how they feel, but pansexual is. That itself is reason enough for the word to exist.

Of course, those ignorant (meaning lacking knowledge, not stupid) bisexual people are hardly to blame for all the issues. The same misunderstanding exists in nearly all GSM spaces. This leads to a feedback loop, where people who misunderstand try to explain it to people who are asking, then those new people misunderstand too, and go on to misexplain it to even more people, until you end up with posts like [https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/99bppr/i\_need\_to\_vent\_about\_pansexuality\_and\_biphobia\_in](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/99bppr/i_need_to_vent_about_pansexuality_and_biphobia_in). The text of the post doesnt seem like that big a deal, but the way it was titled is problematic. Imagine if there was a post by a pan person entitled I need to vent about bisexuality. Doesnt seem right, does it? Maybe vent about biphobic pan people, or just biphobic people in general, but to generalize the venting to all pansexual people is completely unfair.

The GSM community as a whole is already put down enough by people outside it. We dont need infighting too. No GSM community should ever be that way toward any other. Were all here because of the people we love. Lets leave the hate behind and keep it about love.    "
180," For what it's worth, which may be nothing, I am bisexual (I just lurk here to see the discussion) but the generalization and meanness toward pansexual people is completely hypocritical and unacceptable. No LGBT community should ever be that way toward any other. I don't represent /r/bisexual in any official capacity, but I'd still like to extend an apology on behalf of everyone there.

I'd also like to make a post on /r/bisexual calling out this behavior. Could you (or anyone else here) provide examples of this behavior in /r/bisexual so I can list it in that post?  "
181, /r/noshitsherlock 
182," I'm not your chief, pal.  "
183,  
184," No.

Consider gravity. The Newtonian model of gravity, that Fg=G\*m1\*m2/d^2 is a very useful model, and is almost correct in most circumstances, but it is fatally flawed in others. Relativity is a much better model, and is correct in (I think) all circumstances, but it is much harder to work with. 

In exactly the same way, bisexual people will often describe themselves as being attracted to both men and women, but that's just a situationally convenient simplification. In truth, bisexual people experience both heterosexual and homosexual attractions, the heterosexual part of course being any gender that is not their own, but that's much harder to explain than simply saying both men and women, but is fatally flawed in some circumstances.

190, I don't really know anyone well enough to ask that. I've mostly been looking on Grindr and RAOBJ.  
191, Hell yes I do.  
192," My response is usually something like ""You tell me, how did you know you were straight before you had sex?"" "
193," A straight person, a bisexual person, and a pansexual person walk into an ice cream store. The straight person only likes chocolate. The bi person likes chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, pistachio, etc. The pan person likes the ice cream regardless of flavor. It's not necessarily that they like all flavors, they just don't really care about the flavor. Replace ice cream flavors with genders and that's the difference. It's very subtle, but that's the best way I've heard to describe it.  "
194," I've been trying, but it keeps falling through because of schedules and whatnot. Not giving up hope though!  "
195," I'm bi, but I've never had any kind of experience with a man. I want to give someone a blowjob so badly.  "
196, Part 2 when? 
197," OPs has two nested for loops, whereas this only has one multiplication, one addition, and one exponentiation. It should run much faster, even if it converges slower.  "
198," True, but OPs is O(n^2 ) (nothing against you OP, your solution is cool, this is just for dicussion), and that one is O(n\*log(n)\*log(log(n))) I think. To get a lot of accuracy you could pass it a large n, then OPs would take a long time to return but this one would be fast-ish.  "

212," I had something similar. My sister bought a slinky-like thing that goes up and down your arm, but it also has two normal states: collapsed, and expanded. It will naturally go toward whichever it's closest to. If you consider the force pulling it to be expended to be positive, and the force pulling it to be collapsed to be negative, then the intermediate value theorem proves that there will be one point at which it will be in unstable equalibrium: not collapsed, not expanded, and not moving toward either, but any slight movement will cause it to go toward the new closest one. I never managed to actually achieve this equalibrium, but I know that it exists!  "

Great survey by the way. I do feel that it focused too much on entirely gay or entirely lesbian people though. I am bisexual (and indicated so on the survey), and bi people have many, but not all of the same problems as homosexual people, and some more that they don't even have.  "

275," How has he supported LGBT? He says he does, but everything he actually does contradicts that, and most of his supporters follow suit. The military transgender ban, the stupid debacles over restrooms and cakes. Is it a coincidence that EVERY SINGLE ONE of the people I've met who were anti LGBT we're Trump supporters? I have yet to meet someone wearing a MAGA hat that wasn't shouting at a crowd. Yes, there are crazies on both sides, no one is denying that, but it's NOT a coincidence that white supremacists, sexists, anti-LGBT groups, warmongers, almost every single hate group supports Trump.

282," Not a choice. With the discrimination and hatred still present today, why would anyone choose to be gay?  "
283," Don't worry, I'm pretty sure all bi people feel this way every so often. There are days where I don't notice guys at all and worry that I'm actually straight, and days where I don't notice girls at all, and worry that I'm actually gay (the worries here are more worry that I lied to myself and others about being bi, not about actually being straight or gay). On top of that, very few bi people are 50/50, most have a preference that is very heavy but not 100%, which sounds like it matches you perfectly.  "

Baking soda is such a miraculous material that experience from asbestos and lead would tell us that something must be wrong with it, like maybe causing cancer or something. I now there's nothing actually wrong with it, but it seems like there should be.  "

Oh, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexual_behavior_in_animals. If you don't trust Wikipedia, look at their own citations. Turns out I was wrong, it's not found in just 200 species -  its found in *every* species with sexes, to varying degrees.  "
327," How could you possibly know if it's painful or not? You've never experienced it.

Two, yes, there are actually homosexual animals in the wild. If I recall correctly, upwards of 200 species have been observed to have non-heterosexual members, equally distributed among males and females.

Finally, what's biological is sex: you are either biologically male, or biologically female, and one's identity usually conforms to this. That much is not contended. However, ones biological sex should only be important to three people: the person themselves, their significant other, and their doctor. For everyone else, it shouldn't matter. I've never met a trans person who brought attention to the fact that they're trans any more than when it was relevant.  "
328," It's supposed to be a measure of difficulty with 6 being the hardest, but there's no official way to measure a song's difficulty so people assign the difficulties themselves. No one does this consistently, so it's unfortunately mostly useless.  "
329," *sigh* Fine, I'll play along.

Every furry I know of has no interest whatsoever in actual bestiality. There's a very clear line between fantasy and reality. Further, I imagine for most, real animals aren't even attractive. Furry porn is usually either completely anthropomorphic or heavily stylized so it looks nothing like the real animal.

Second, your comment about trans people tells me that you have no clue what and how trans people feel. Imagine your body were suddenly female (I'm assuming you're male). Your brain subconsciously expects you to have a penis, so suddenly not having one would be shocking, uncomfortable, even painful. That is what the vast majority of trans people feel in every part of their body, every moment of their lives: gender dysphoria. They have a male mind, but we're born in a female body, or vice versa. Call that a mental illness if you want to, as I know it technically is, but right now the best ""therapy""  we have for it is hormone treatment, occasionally gender reassignment surgery - and acceptance. However, I know my explanation here will not be good enough. You'll still mock them, you'll still hate them, you'll still misunderstand them. The only thing I can hope you'll do is try; try to interact with trans people, here on reddit or elsewhere, try to understand what and how they feel, that it's so much more than ""people who believe they're a different gender because they haven't seen their genitals in a while"".  "

Most men in studio produced straight porn are the stereotypical big manly man types, who I am not at all attracted to, but when the man is the smaller, lean type, then absolutely yes. Even then though, the focus is usually only on the woman, with no appreciation for the guy. It's understandable, most people only want the woman, but it still sucks.  "
337, Can the infinity stones create matter from nothing? I think only the reality stone comes close.

369, Cry.  
370," Eh, it makes sense. Mario is obviously the king, and they want to include Luigi as well, but all the other pieces besides king and queen are doubled. There isn't another character equivalent to Luigi, so the queen was the only viable option for him. The princesses are somewhat equivalent characters, so to include both of them, they should represent the same piece.

434," It does take a very long time to get used to the gestures, but having used them in beta for a while, I think they're better. It's definitely going to be controversial though.  "
435," When you want your screen bright, you generally don't care about the specific brightness. You're likely to just max it out. But when you want it dark, you're likely to care about how dark, as it's easy to be too bright or too dark. Logarithmic control solves this, as more of the bar can be considered dark, so there's more fine control over darkness, while still allowing it to be bright. 

Logarithmic control just means that the real value grows slowly when the bar is on the left, and much quicker when it's on the right.  "

440," The syntax is good, the functionality of it is good, everything about it is good. Except how picky the compiler is. 

For example, when using a Scanner, you'll often want to decide between scanning a file or stdin. One way you might do this is to declare the scanner but not instantiate it, then if a filename was provided, instantiate it with the correct File object, else instantiate it with stdin. When it reached the end of this block, the Scanner will *never* be null, yet it says that it might be because the actual instantiations were done in an ifelse block. Thus, you have to instantiate a dummy Scanner before deciding which real one to make, which is just a waste of resources. It would be much better if it just noticed and warned about this potential issue instead of saying FUCK YOU DO IT RIGHT.

451," For the longest time, I thought you were talking about the head of your dick and pubic hair, and thought ""Well duh"". Shows where my mind is I guess.  "
452," Being effeminate and being trans are very different. I myself am somewhat effeminate, but I am very definitely a man. Trans women aren't men who ""like to act like women"". For the vast majority of trans people, having the body they do causes extreme anxiety and discomfort because their brain subconsciously expects the opposite. Imagine if you were suddenly a woman (I'm assuming you're male). Your brain expects you to have a penis, so suddenly not having one would be shocking and uncomfortable. Trans people get that feeling every moment of their lives. That is what gender dysphoria means. Call that a mental illness if you want to, as I know it technically is, but right now the best ""therapy"" we have for it is is hormone therapy, and sometimes gender reassignment surgery to reduce the dysphoria.

476," My 2 sisters and I are all bi, but our parents are cometely straight. I'd say no.  "
477," I first realized I was bi about 7 months ago now. Since then there have been 3 major coming out events for me.

2 months after I realized, I told my (also bi) girlfriend that I wanted to talk to her about something, but only in a local nature-y place that we both love. I wanted to keep it a surprise, but I did drop some hints on the way that I'm genuinely surprised she didn't figure out, like the letter 'Q' (at that time I was just questioning), the number 5 for 5 letters in LGBTQ, etc. When we got there, there were an unfortunate number of people around, and I wasn't comfortable saying around other people, so we had to wait for a bit. No big deal, we both like it there anyway. Eventually they all left the area, and I said something along the lines of ""So the thing I wanted to talk about. I've been thinking about it for a while now, and I think I'm bi."" She just looked at me for 5 second (that felt like an hour), then a huge smile broke out on her face, and she jumped up and gave me a huge hug. Then she asked ""Wait, so what were those hints about then?"" I explained them and she said they were the worst hints she's ever heard. \\\_()\_/ We kept talking about it for a long time until the area closed, telling her about how I realized it, some new crushes I fianlly allowed myself to have, etc. 

About a month later, I still hadn't come out to anyone else, when something really unexpected happened. We had come up on the last minute of the last day of the college semester, when my number theory instructor said ""By the way everyone, in case you don't know anyone gay in your life, you've been taking a class from a flaming homosexual. Have a nice summer!"" His confidence really resonated with me, and I wanted to thank him for... Well, I'm not sure how to word it. I'm sure everyone here understands though. Thing is, I froze up, and couldn't approach him to talk about it before he left. Fortunately, finals week was still coming up, so I'd have another chance. After the test had come and gone, I approached him to talk about it, but some other people had already gone up with questions about the class or the test. The group ended up having to leave the room because another final was starting, but eventually everyone else had left and I was finally able to talk to him: ""I just wanted to say I really appreciate what you told us on the last day of class, especially because I'm (with air quotes) 'coming to terms' with being bi myself."" He congratulated me on realizing it and being able to come out, and asked who I was out to. When I said just my girlfriend, he asked if my family would be supportive. I knew they would be, I just hadn't done it yet. He said that I could come talk with him at any time, and asked if I knew about the LGBTQ affairs office on campus. I didn't, but (and I still don't know why) I said I did. I finally went to check it about a month ago but it was closed for renovations. I still want to go there again once it's open, but I don't know when that will be. I should really go talk with him again.

Anyway, after he asked about my family, I decided I would tell them next time I saw them (I live about 2 hours away). Fortunately, my little sister was already openly bi, so I could come out to her first easily, and ask her for advice. So I did, but it was pretty rocky on my part; I fumbled over almost every word. She got the meaning though, and just said ""Cool. Same,"" with a smile on her face. I asked for advice, and she suggested coming out to my older sister next, though she wouldn't say why, so I was a bit confused. This time it went much better, I was actually able to get my words out. Turns out the reason my sister suggested coming out to her next was that she's bi, too! My parents are 3 for 3! I had always assumed that she was asexual because she never had any kind of boyfriend or anything, but it turns out that she's newly engaged to her long distance girlfriend. Finally, I came out to my parents together, who both said that they appreciate the courage it takes, and that it really doesn't make any difference to them. I came back with ""Thank you for... Well, I suppose for not caring,"" which got some good laughs out of then. I wasn't expecting any trouble from any of them. The onto preson in my family I was wary of coming out to was my grandma (who lives with us). My sisters feel the same way too, they haven't told her. I didn't come out to her until my next visit. When I did, she was perfectly fine though. I actually love when she said, ""I know I'm the oldest fart around here, so I'm the most likely to be all 'gragragragragra' about it, but everyone deserves to be who they are, and with whoever they love."" I told my sisters about that too, but I think they still haven't come out to her yet.

Damn, this got long. Anyway, that's it for me so far. I don't really use my social media accounts, so I haven't come out there. Maybe I will in the future.

tl;dr: Came out to my girlfriend in a local nature-y area, then came out to a college instructor who came out to the class, then came out to my family, where it turns out all my siblings are also bi.  "

544," It should have a different way of saving you from every death.

In the void or lava or suffocating in a block, it should teleport you to the nearest safe block. When drowning, it could clear the water around you like a sponge. If you would die from fall damage, it could stop your downward momentum and give you levitation for 5 seconds. If you would die in combat, it could give your opponent huge knockback for a single strike to get you away from the battle. If that would send you off a cliff, well, you were about to die anyway.

551, But you know other programmers will repost it and call it reuse.  
552," My girlfriend's parents are completely idiots with money, but by far the worst thing they've done is pay thousands of dollars for a complete kitchen and backyard remodel... In a rental property, in hopes that they'd get a discount on rent for a while. 

The landlord had already said that, though they have permission to remodel it, they wouldn't get a discount on rent. They went on and did it anyway, then still got upset when they didn't get a discount.

They moved out of the house a few months later, too.  "
553," The main issue people seem to have with it is that it would cause a lot of things to have to be remade.

As others have pointed out, many vanilla/bukkit/(whatever has replaced bukkit these days) servers make use of the void and the sky to punish and trap players. This would make that option no longer available, so those systems would have to be redone. Though FWIW, I think the void should still exist in some capacity, but it should be possible to build there, and it should only kill you if you've been falling for a certain amount of time.

Many mods that have been built around around the 256 block limit would also have to be redone, like Rogue-Like Dungeons, or anything else that generates large structures.  "
554," That's the main benefit, correct. Most of the other benefits are just based off of that, like potentially much more interesting world generation, much bigger structures, etc. However, for weak PCs, there might also be some performance benefits. When mining, the land above could become unloaded, or vice versa, and free up resources. It also just makes more sense in general. Why store a 3d world in 2d chunks?  "
555," I'm going to explain from the very beginning, in case anyone doesn't know.

In Minecraft, world are divided into 16x16 ""chunks"". These are how the game saves and loads the world. When the player is within a certain distance (your view distance) of these chunks, they will load, and will be unloaded otherwise. That's how the ""infinite"" world works; it only loads a small part of it at a time. 

However, Minecraft world are only infinite horizontally. Vertically, there are only 256 blocks tall. This is because each 16x16 chunk saves the entire associated column, so infintely tall worlds would make the chunk system useless. That is, unless the chunks are instead 16x16x16, cubic instead of square. Then, the game would load the chunks in a certain sphere around you, and worlds could be as tall as they are wide.

However, this presents some technical problems, like figuring out sky-lighting, very high up gravity blocks, things where the stuff above you matters. If blocks are too high up, they'll be unloaded, and thus not registered by any of these systems. There are workarounds to all of these, but Mojang still have decided not to implement cubic chunks, even though everyone in the entire community wants them.  "

583, No!  
584," In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.  "
585," Here's the issue with that. 

Based on what you're saying, the client won't know that a custom command is valid. Thus, it won't know if the player using the client is allowed to execute it, meaning the server would have to keep track of which players can execute which command, and decide which commands to execute, and which to ignore. But that means that every single command attempt will have to be sent to the server, which presents a very big problem, in that players could simply spam even invalid commands to effectively DoS the server.  "
586," Yes, but they require the player to AFK while placing sand. Having an automated way to place sand would make it so much nicer.  "

593," Arbitrary dimensional math. I'm pretty interested in math in general, but recently I've been taking things I know about and trying (usually successfully) to generalize them to an arbitrary number of dimensions. 

For example, everyone knows the Pythagorean Theorem: given a point in 2 dimensions, it's distance from the origin is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 ). Most people won't know however that that formula is easily generalized: a point in 3 dimensions is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 ) away from the origin. And in general, a point in D dimensions is sqrt(x1^2 + x2^2 + ... + xD^2 ) away from the origin. That's the kind of thing I've been doing, but with much more advanced topics.  "

619," I implemented the programming language Brainfuck using minecraft redstone (in fact using what I call 'extended pure' redstone: only full blocks, dust, torches, and repeaters for the pure part, and adding pistons for the extended part (pun not intended)).

The click-and-drag rectangle makes something happen to it though, in that it changes it's color to be slightly bluer. Releasing it then makes it so that it has to redraw it with the original colors, but only in the spots that were covered by the rectangle, leading to this effect. Again though, this doesn't explain how it became green to begin with.  "

651," I initially read that as something like ""MRW I have a friend named Danger..."" "
652," For integers, you could define digit count this way:

Given an integer n, a numeric base b, and the smallest natural number m such that b^m  |n|, n can be described as an m-digit numeral in base b.

For example, 100 is a 3 digit number, as 3 is the smallest integer that satisfies the inequality for m, in that 10^3  100. The same goes for 10^2  14, so 14 is a 2 digit number. 

By this definition, 0 is a 0 digit number in base 10, as 10^0 = 1  0. 

This is, of course, a slightly contrived definition, but it works.  "
653," But we're talking about numerals, not strings of digits. The values on a combo lock could be any pictogram, it just so happens that numbers work best.  "

679," It sounds to me like OP wants to detect when an item is taken out of a chest by a user. In that case, the item will already be in the chest, no hopper to it. Of course, it might be possible to have the chest completely full with a hopper pointing into it, block the hopper from receiving any items while it has one in it, then pull output from that hopper's comparator output. In that case, an off pulse will indicate that an item was taken out of the chest.  "

714," This is the first time I've ever written anything like this, so sorry if it's a bit rambly.

So, I'm a 21 year old guy. I lived with my parents until 2 years ago, when, during a visit to my girlfriend (let's call her T) who lived about 4 hours away, my dad called and suggested I start classes at the University I had been wanting to go to, which happens to be in the same city. So I did, and I ended up moving in with her.

As we moved my stuff there and started unpacking and setting up, I realized I didn't really have much personal stuff, like posters and knick-knacks, etc. I had stuff on my bedroom wall in my parents house, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it wasn't really my stuff. For example, I had two pictures/posters of TV shows I liked that were made for me by my sister as a gift. I had them up still because I didn't want her to feel bad, but the shows had long since fallen out of my interest. The same goes for pretty much all decoration I had around my room; they were gifts, and while I appreciate them, they're not really personal. 

So when I moved out and didn't feel obligated to keep them up anymore, my space in our place was almost completely barren. I had no posters, no pictures, nothing to indicate that it was my space. And for a while, that didn't bug me at all. I'm a computer science major, so I'm on my computer almost all the ti- there I go making excuses again; I'm leaving this here so you can see my actual thought process, the type of thoughts I'm trying to stop (explained later on). Anyway, it didn't bug me until T brought it up, when she asked why I didn't have anything. I said I didn't know. I mean, there are certainly plenty of things I'd like to have up, I just haven't bothered yet. Things like... like... 

It then occurred to me that there really wasn't anything I liked enough to warrant having wall decorations (etc) of. And more and more, it occurred to me that there was hardly anything I liked at all, just one or two games and a website. And as I kept thinking about it, I realized that until then, I had been living pretty much exclusively for my family. I had no friends besides T,  I never went to any kind of public events of my own volition (I'd go if my family did, but not otherwise), I never got anything personal for myself, I never cared about what I wore, etc (I'm saying etc a lot. Sorry about that). What T saw in me up until now, I have no idea.

So I finally decided to change that. I've been consciously trying to stop myself from making lame excuses at to why I'm not getting or going to something I like, just like the excuse I started to make above. I've been allowing myself to get posters and knick-knacks, and allowing myself to try things I hadn't before. Living in a new city is a perfect opportunity for that; there's no one to question me about it, no one to criticize me for it.

During this yet ongoing process of this self rediscovery, one of the things I kept coming back to was sexuality. I distinctly remember thinking about it all the way back in elementary school, but I had told myself ""I'm not gay. It'd be perfectly fine if I was, but I'm not."" Even back then, I had some sort of inkling that I had the same feelings for both girls and boys, but I didn't know then that bisexuality was a thing. By the time I did, I had gotten it stuck in my head that I was straight as a rod, I'm not allowed to be attracted to guys. It wasn't until about 5 months ago that I was able to break through that mental wall, and finally realize that this rod is bent, that I'm bisexual.

That's not the only realization I've come to, but it's the main focus of this post. I came out to my family one by one; first my younger sister, who was already openly bi, then my older sister, who it turns out is not-so-openly also bi (my parents are 3 for 3!), then my parents together (who are both straight. So much for that gay gene). Everyone was fully supportive, and proud of me for coming out, and I love them for that. 

Eventually it occurred to me that this is a part of who I am now, I should get something to commemorate it. I looked around the city for pride stuff, but there was almost nothing. It wasn't until I tried a local Super Target that I finally found what I was looking for. Even then though, they had barely anything with the bi flag colors (but a surprisingly huge amount of stuff with the trans flag colors. Didn't expect that). I looked through the stuff for almost 15 minutes (all the while there were people walking by, who I realize now I effectively came out to just by being there), and finally settled on the pride bracelet in the picture. It's fully rainbow, but it unintentionally has the bi flag colors on the back, so that's good enough for me.

I now wear that thing everywhere. I've had it for a week, and I've only taken it off to wash it. It not only commemorates me being bi, it commemorates me finally getting to know myself, finally allowing myself to have a personality. So as I said in the title, I cannot express how happy it makes it to finally have it.

Damn, this got long. Sorry about that. I just had to get this story out there. It feels good to write all of it out, to get it all straight (heh) and confirm to myself that it's real. Thanks for reading.  "
715,  
716, I read that as allo fit and was confused for way too long.  
717," The difference between bisexuality and pansexuality is very subtle. Here's how I understand it: I, as a bisexual man, am capable of being sexually attracted to both men and women, as well as all those in between. Pansexuality is a sub-definition to that in which the gender of the attractive person is entirely irrelevant, the pansexual just finds people in general attractive.  "
718, Bi in AZ here too. I'm heading to Pride in the Desert when it comes at the end of Spetember. You thinking of going?  
719," If it really is Putin behind all do this (which is all but guaranteed at this point), then he really is a brilliant tactician. In just a few fell swoops he has thrown thw west (US, UK, EU, etc.) into turmoil. I fucking hate the man, but you have to appreciate the brilliance.  "

724," My Target has tons of rainbow stuff, but hardly anything for the bi flag. Just beer cozies, head/wristbands, and a sash, none of which I really use :( I settled for a rainbow pride bracelet, but I would've loved a blue, purple and pink one.  "
725," The way I've heard it that clicked for me is that, were a bisexual and a pansexual to walk into an ice cream store, the bisexual would like the chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, pistachio, etc, but the pansexual wouldn't care about flavor, and just likes the ice cream. Replace ice cream flavors with genders, and that's the difference.  "

730," I've been considering setting up a Grindr account. Maybe you could, too.  "
731," Business owners have the right to give or refuse service to whomever they please, regardless of their reason.

I don't understand why the whole thing about wedding cakes and the like is a such a big deal anyway. Yes, it's discrimination, and that's awful, but if they don't want to bake a cake for you, you can take your business elsewhere, and that's their loss. Maybe post a review, shame them, whatever, but taking it to court seems counter-productive, because if you win and they bake a cake for you, then you're giving your business and money to people who would discriminate against you, and that makes no sense!  "
732," I have no clue how people can tell which guys are gay/bi so they can hit on them. Or can't they? Do gay/bi guys who hit on other guys just hope? I've never hit on or been hit on by a guy, so I wouldn't know.  "
733," I'm a guy, and I realized I was bi about 5 months ago now, and have been slowly coming out to the people in my life.  I've yet to encounter any biphobia luckily, but after all the horror stories I've heard from my girlfriend (who is also bi) and from this sub, I'm really worried about it. There's a pride event coming up in my city that I want to go to, which will be the most public I've ever been about my sexuality, and that's the biggest thing I'm worried about encountering: not the homophobic, ""family-value"" types, they don't matter, but others in the LGBT community that are supposed to be allies.  "
734," I can only hope that they got this patent so no one else would be able to do this, and they have no plan of using it.  "

740," Technically, sets are unordered so this doesn't really matter, but 2^x does give values in the same order listed in the question. Both are correct, though.  "
741," For me (at a community college in Arizona), pre-calculus was simply review of everything algebra, geometry, and trig. Calc 1 was introducing the limit, the derivitave, and the integral, as well as concepts like convergence tests. Calc 2 was all about integration methods, and was the hardest of the line by far. Calc 3 was multidimensional/vector calculus.  "

753," It absolutely is a thing, I'd assume almost everyone here started as bicurious. Your life is your own; experiment, see what you like. For now, welcome!  "
754, I realized I was bi about 4 months ago and I still sometimes feel like I'm faking my homosexual attractions. It's been hard to undo my mental conditioning built up over my entire life to ingore such feelings.  
755," I'd use paler colors so you can see them better against the balck, but that looks really good!  "
756, Why have I never thought of this? I'm setting this up as soon as I can!  
757," You're right, I didn't think about that. The actual meaning is better then.  "
758," I always though the blue and magenta were supposed to represent attraction to men and women, respectively, and purple was the blending of the two. Same effect I suppose, but that makes a bit more sense in my mind.  "
759," Every rational creature fears the dark, because they know there are creatures in it that don't.  "

767, Nothing to cure.  
768," Not that it matters now, but smelting the compressed cobblestone in the alloy smelter didn't work because it was set to alloy only mode, meaning it won't function as a normal furnace, and only runs the alloy recipes.  "
769, Even Keemstar showed some respect in the end. This is just repugnant.

By the time I knew about it, I had gotten it stuck in my head that I was straight as a rod, guys aren't appealing.

As such, if we were to download the files they have over and over, that data limit will drain quickly, and they'll run out for the month, saving people from their scam. "

892," Except it is possible to computer with some accuracy. Given p = percentage upvoted, s = score, u = number of upvotes, and d = number of downvotes, and knowing that s = u - d (approximately), and p = u / (u + d), we can solve for u and d, u = p * s / (2p - 1), d = (1 - p) * s / (2p - 1) "

897," I'm using a live wallpaper, and my friend who has an iPhone wants the same one, but the app doesn't exist on iPhone, so the best I can do is try to get a ""screenshot"" of the live wallpaper while it's running, and send that as an image. That app doesn't seem capable of doing that, as when I try to, it just shows me the icon for the live wallpaper, and only gives a link to the downloads it for the play store when I try to share it.  "
898, That seems to just get a link to the play store page for it. I want to capture an image of it working.  
899," I'm trying to get an image of JUST my live wallpaper (so I can share the background with someone who doesn't have an Android), but I can't find a way to see just the wallpaper. Even blank launchers have buttons at the bottom and a status bar at the top. Does anyone know of a way to see only the current wallpaper? 

I'm on the Pixel 1, running the Android P beta, if that helps "
900," Thanks!  It's just Android O (8.1) with [Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher.prime) The wallpaper is called [Wave](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wave.paperworld.wallpaper), with [this preset](https://i.imgur.com/B2d7aX4.png). "
901," No one thinks it was a good deal, but it was a sacrifice for the greater good of the world.  "

I didn't know she had advanced Alzheimer's, as the last time I had seen her was 5 years prior, so it still hit me really hard, but he knew, and though he was of course still crying at the funeral, he had already grieved, and was for the most part alright.

981," The Dominion was decimating the empire in the Great War. If not for the white gold concordat, the empire would've surely been destroyed. Now the empire must rebuild, and if the dominion wants to be there and enforce the rules, the empire can't really argue. But the stormcloaks can't either. Stormcloak soldiers are objectively weaker, less organized, and less numerous than empire soldiers, so if the empire can't fight the dominion, there's no way in Sovngarde the stormcloaks can.  "
982, There was a post recently where it was confirmed that the daedric princes recognize Talos as a god. 
983," Ah, my bad, I misunderstood.

I suppose you could use 

    password += 'a'+random.randrange(0,52)

In Python, character plus int means the character that far after that one in the ASCII table. That line would add a random letter with a random case to your password.  "
984," That's just shorthand for every lowercase letter, every uppercase letter, every numeral, then every symbol. That string just contains all the characters that you would want to be possible in your random password.  "

    password = """"

It was a comedy act that caused my coworker, who I know would normally scarcely hurt a fly, to have to be literally held back from socking them in the face after countless, extremely racist remarks. Bull. Shit.  "
1011," Fucking hell, that sure was something. I'd like to spread a little positivity after they hate they were preaching. See, there actually is something good that came out of that: they united and emboldened the entire student body against them. 

There were, at one time a maximum of maybe 200 people there, but they were coming and going, so maybe 500, 600 people in total, and among them, there was no debate about politics, or religion, only respect, understanding, and acceptance of all people and beliefs among the crowd. There were (good) Christians, Muslims, Jews, Atheists, hell, I think there were even a few Hindus in there, and not one person in the crowd was directly telling anyone else that their religion is wrong, only saying that people of all faiths (and lack thereof) see through the hate they were spewing. 

At one point, while he was talking about how all gays just want to rape other guys, I felt supported enough by the crowd to come out and confront him, being a bi guy myself, something only my girlfriend knew. I don't want to make this about me, but I'm sure that others in the crowd felt the same kind of thing, that same empowerment, through the disgust.

At this moment, I couldn't be more proud of the student body of the University of Arizona. I doubt we made any kind of difference to their opinions, but within 15 minutes of finally walking away from the crowd, I saw 3 openly gay and lesbian couples, happily holding hands while walking across campus. That tells me that they felt the same way I did. Not filled with fear, as they wanted, but empowered by the crowd fighting back, and the love and support of all the student on campus. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, to all the students who were in the crowd, all those who were protesting, both with serious and funny signs, all those who fought against them.

And to Official Street Preachers, I believe I speak for everyone on campus when I say good riddance.  "

According to Argeir, language comes as naturally to dragons as breathing, so does that translate into something akin to singing? I doubt mortals would find Dovah singing enjoyable, or even recognize it as such, but it seems like that's something that would come very naturally to them as well.  "

It's about a teen, or similarly young guy training to participate in a decathlon. He was in group therapy, and meets a girl there who ends up being his girlfriend.

I've tried a whole bunch of console commands for resetting quests, but fear that I've now done more harm than good. Is there any way to just completely reset the Companions? I have Enhanced Skyrim Factions: Companions if that helps at all. "
1049," So this whole thing started with nothing out of the ordinary. I was just about to start up a game, and everything went completely black (not from the game, I hadn't started it yet), only my mouse was still there. Moving the mouse all around, nothing. Ctrl+Shift+Esc, nothing. Ctrl+Alt+Delete, nothing. I pressed the windows key, and the start icon came back. Then I could mouse over where stuff was on the taskbar and the icons reappeared, but were nonfunctional. Ctrl+Alt+Delete, Ctrl+Shift+Esc, Win+R, still nothing. 

I tried to put it to sleep with the power button, and when it woke back up, the screen was completely gray for a few seconds, then completely white for a few seconds, then black again. This time, nothing at all worked. 

I did a hard shutdown, and trying to reboot showed the windows logo with the spinning white dots, and after a while the logo disappeared, but the dots stayed. I left that going for an hour and nothing happened. I did the same thing a couple of times with the same results, and it took me to recovery options. I tried it's automated options, and they failed. I tried to reset, and it got to 9% then failed. Subsequent reset attempts now don't even begin, they just fail immediately. 

I try running chkdsk /r /x, it says everything looks fine, and it doesn't try to change anythkng. Running sfc /scannow reaches 100% verification of the system scan phase, then says ""Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation"", and dies. 

I then tried bootrec options, and bootrec /scanos identifies 0 windows installations. I found a guide online to try to backup and replace the bcd, and though it says everything completed successfully, it still identified 0 installations.

I am now completely lost. I don't have recovery media, as the laptop came with windows 8 and upgraded to 10. Please, please help. Even if I can't fix it, please just help me identify the problem.

It's currently 2:45 AM for me, so I can't stay up with this thread. I will supply anything else anyone may need in the morning, though. Thank you in advance for your help.

Oh, it's worth mentioning that I am on the Windows 10 Creators update, and I am not, though I previously was, in the insider program. 

Edit: I tried booting one more time. When it was stuck on the spinning dots, I pressed Enter on the number pad, and the screen went full gray again. It's now stuck there. I doubt it was pressing Enter that caused that, but it's worth mentioning.

Edit 2: I HAVE A MOUSE! Pressing Win+P brings up a pane on the left, but it's blank. I know that's the projection pane, and it seems somewhat functional because I can use the keyboard to control it, though there's no visible feedback when using it. I can't get the taskbar back, and Ctrl+Shift+Esc and Ctrl+Alt+Delete still do nothing.

Edit 3: I've determined that, at the very least, the graphics drivers aren't starting, despite the above, as Ctrl+Alt+Arrow doesn't do anything. "

1057,  
1058," For the past couple years, I have suspected it as a possibility, but always though it must be something else. I'd tell myself that I don't have a right to be depressed, and in a way I had a point. I've not had anyone super close to me die (grandparents have died, but that's it), I haven't been raped or otherwise assaulted (bullied in elementary and middle school, but that's long gone). The only thing I've had that people associate with causing depression is stress. I was a very gifted student, and as such everyone expected 150% grades on everything, and when I couldn't meet their expectations, I was yelled at, even when I still had among the highest grades in the class (""The average for the class was 72%,"" ""I don't care what other people got, why did YOU only get an 89%?""). That's how it was initially. After a lot of that, I became overwhelmed by guilt, which made my grades slip, which further compounded my guilt, which made my grades slip more, until I was barely passing any of my classes, even math, which I was and am especially good at. I know what I'm saying now contradicts what I said before about having no reason to be depressed, but I'm really just stream-of-consciousing right now. I just had my worst explosion/breakdown in months and need to get this out of my system. Anyway, I still managed to pass all of my classes, and moved on to a community college, where I managed to fail two classes entirely. I had to retake them because they were required for my associates degree. Fortunately, because it's a community college, the classes there are extremely cheap compared to other places. Now though, I'm at university, and I feel like I'm not doing much better. I'm still overwhelmed by feelings of guilt, which is making me slip in my classes, compounding my guilt further. To make it worse, these classes now cost thousands of dollars each, so I can't just retake them on a whim. All I can do now is try to power through it and make them work. Not only is it this shit with university, but I also just recently moved in with my girlfriend, a d finances are extremely tight. We just had a fucking bed bug infestation, and her parents just dropped almost $3,000 getting us into a new place (hello even more guilt). I also don't want to bring it up to my parents because they have enough shit going on right now with my sister, who actually was assaulted and is now dealing with Depression, PTSD and seizures induced by that assault. Part of me still feels like I have no right to be depressed, but I'm now pretty sure that I have it. Im not suicidal or homicidal or anything like that, but I'm just sick and tired of feeling this way. Anyway, I should stop now, this is extremely long as it is. If you've read this far, then thanks for giving a shit. I'm currently sitting in a parking garage on university campus, and I need to go in to do some homework. I just needed to get all that off my chest after the explosion I just had. Also, sorry if this is full of typos, which it probably is, I just wrote all this on my phone.

1067," To get this achievement, you would have to take void damage in survival mode and survive. You could do this using elytra and fireworks. Fly low enough in the End to take void damage, then quickly use fireworks to escape. This achievement would require the ""The End."" achievement before it can be taken.

As this is an achievement, there is no obligation for players to do this. Also, it's not insanely hard, so it's not out of reach for achievement hunters.

This would be a really fun challenge, with the risk of losing your elytra wings. However, since the End is already opened up to anyone that has elytra, it shouldn't be too difficult to replace them.

Sounds are slow to load, too. It will be completely silent for a while, then play all the sounds it should've been playing all at once.

    Xmax=264-A

If A equals 1 after running this code, the program is being run on a TI-84+CSE/CE. If it's 0, it's running on something else. This could be used for proper UI scaling, knowing whether or not to use colors when drawing on the graph screen, et cetera. "

I wanted to see if I could make one for myself, and I managed to do it. I'm quite happy with how it turned out. It works very differently from /u/steelbolt's, in that while his has a different way of handling moves for every possible direction, mine uses variables to accomplish the same. Also, this version is contained in one program, which I greatly prefer over having multiple programs like functions. One thing about this version though is that instead of using powers of two, it just counts up in order to save screen space, as I used the home screen instead of the graph screen.

1113," This is a very simple Connect 4 game. If you somehow don't know what Connect 4 is, it is a two-player game in which players alternate dropping colored disks into a 9 column by 6 row ""board"". The first player to make four in a row in any direction (including diagonal) wins. This version doesn't have win detection, but it looks very good IMO and has some nice animation, too.

1114," Langton's Ant is a very simple cellular automata. The rules are if the  tile the ant is in is active, the ant turns left, and if the tile is inactive, it turns right. The ant then toggles the cell it's in and walks forward one tile. For more on Langton's Ant, check out [this video by numberphile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWBToaXK5T0). Amazingly, the entire program fits on one screen. The first line should be changed to :If 0 if you want to draw the image over another one. The initial values of A and B just tell it where to start drawing. The values I gave are my preferred ones.

1115," So this puzzle apparently isn't nearly as well known as I thought it was. The goal is quite simple: deactivate every tile. The catch is that whenever you toggle a tile, the four tiles directly above, below, to the left of, and to the right of it also toggle. For example:



 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
---|---|----|----|----
1 | * | * |  | 
2 | * |  |  | 
3 | * | * | | 
4 |  |  | | 

If I were to toggle the point (1,2) (1st column, 2nd row), the board would change to:

 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4
---|---|----|----|----
1 |  | * |  | 
2 |  | * |  | 
3 |  | * | | 
4 |  |  | | 

^^^Note: ^^^I ^^^don't ^^^know ^^^if ^^^this ^^^configuration ^^^is ^^^actually ^^^solvable, ^^^it ^^^was ^^^just ^^^an ^^^example

The board size that you tell it to generate simply sets the number of rows and columns it will use. It's limited to size 12, which will generate a 12x8 board (because of the screen size of the calculator). The difficulty you set will change how many random flips it makes. The value you give it should be a percentage of maximum difficulty, which is (the board size) flips. At greater than this number of flips, the difficulty actually starts going down. Anyway, the code.

1116," This is a program I've been working on for quite some time now, and I think it's finally complete. Most Mandelbrot Set generator programs only do black and white, where the black points don't diverge after n iterations. I've made a program that generates the set more like the images you see online, where each point is colored based on how many iterations it took to diverge, maxing out at n. While this program takes just under 10 hours to run at the suggested settings, the image is absolutely worth it.

1150," As many of you will know, Authur Rose Eldred was awarded the Eagle rank on September 2nd, 1912, becoming the first Eagle Scout in the country. The location of his home at this time however, was unfortunately lost to history, due to the building's demolition and a change in the street numbering system from 3 to 4 digits. The only knowledge that remained of it's location was that it was in Rockville Center, New York, right next door to my hometown, Oceanside. It remained lost for many years until my dad got curious and decided to find it, and after only a few days of searching, he did just that by scouring the public tax record. It turns out that not only was his home not in Rockville Center, but in fact in Oceanside, his home was on the property that is now where I went to elementary school! This was all discovered and confirmed when I was in 5th grade, and we immediately agreed that this would be kept secret from all but the principal so creating a memorial would end up being my Eagle project. Now, 7 years later, that project is complete! In a beautiful twist, the memorial sign now hangs directly over where I first signed up for Cub Scouts. The sign is a 4'x2' wooden board with a picture of Eldred himself, his Eagle medal, and the standard BSA Fleur De Lis. Hand engraved into the sign is the text ""On this site lived Arthur Rose Eldred, a member of Boy Scout Troop 1, and who, on Sepember 2nd, 1912, became the first scout to earn the higher rank: Eagle. His home was razed in 1964 to make way for Florence A. Smith School #2""

This problem is caused by a mob cap for friendly mobs, and the fact that friendly mobs don't despawn. I suggest changing that behavior to make it so that friendly mobs can despawn just the same way hostile mobs do. However, this brings up the issue of friendly mob farms. We don't want those animals to despawn, so we could add a way to make those mobs persistent, namely, branding. The branding rod could be created by smelting an iron ingot, and would have 64 uses before it cooled down, turning back into an iron ingot. It would only be usable on cows, sheep, pigs, etc., and any new friendly mobs added in the future. Branding an animal would create a small mark on their side, and would have the same persistence effect as a nametag.  "

* killedMessage = (mob name) has been purged from the land by (player name)

1171," The update to Farmer Villagers is great, it provides somewhat of a feel of liveliness that I think has been missing in villages for a long time. However, the other Villagers are still as, frankly, dull as ever. I think that the other types of villagers need to have a function like the Farmers now do. For example, the Butcher could be able to deal damage. Currently, villages that are too small to spawn Iron Golems are utterly defenseless, and have no hope of surviving a night even with a player. If the Butcher could deal damage (and chose to), small villages might have a shot at surviving. I don't know what functions the other Villagers could serve, but I think that giving Villagers more of a job would improve the game dramatically. "

* It's a silver Conn trumpet
* It has clickless valves
* It has a first valve trigger. ""Trigger"" isn't the best word for it, but it's the best I could come up with, as it's not a hook.
* When I last had it, the case was *extremely* dusty, and the third valve tuning slide didn't move as it was supposed to; it didn't just fall, you had to actually move it yourself.
* The case has a black valve grip in it
* It has two mouthpieces in it, one for regular trumpet, one for cornet

1258, Is it possible he was just trolling and it was taken *way* too far?

1260," I was in class, and since we were done, the teacher let us talk to each other. Well, I ended up getting into a political conversation. I was for Obama, he was for Romney. We went on and on, each of us making valid points, and counterpoints, until we got to the ""spending spree."" I said that the reason Obama couldn't fix the debt was because of a snowball effect that Bush started. Then - I shit you not - he put his hands over his ears, and started saying ""LALALALALAICAN'THEARYOULALALALALA!"" Anyone else ever had a similar experience? "

1262," I keep seeing people talking about minor update prior to 1.8.2, but I'm not getting anything. Is there anywhere I have to go before launching to get the updates? I have minecraft as a downloaded game, if it matters (I don't even know if there's a disk for it.). "
1263," When I watch people playing minecraft maps on YouTube, they always use /tp to teleport to each other. Will the new update let us do that? "
1264," He said that 99% of what goes in a nuclear reaction comes out as nuclear waste. Well, isn't that waste still technically matter, thus reusable? If I'm asking a stupid question, remember that this is my first day learning about it, but I doubt he'll go into that. "

1269," I'm trying to make a cobblestone generator with lava, water, and redstone repeaters, but I can't figure out how to use the repeaters to make a pulsing electricity current. I've looked on YouTube and couldn't find any good tutorials. Can any of you help me?

Edit: I haven't had time to go to YouTube (no joke) but I think I finally figured it out anyway. I'll post a link later. Sorry for the delay... "
1270," I'm sure you know that almost every religion there is has some sort of flood myth. Well, there might be something to it! A recently discovered, unfathomably large crater was just found in the Indian ocean, suggesting that a meteor crashed into earth, many many years ago. You do the math: meteor+water=wave. A huge wave. I mean, a tsunami. Picture tsunamis in disaster movies. About a mile tall, right? Now picture a wave 30 miles tall. That's how big this wave was. They wouldn't be crazy to think that it covered the entire earth, right?  "
