0, I get even more anxious when the teacher says okay Im going to randomly pick someone.  
1, Excuse me what the fuck? 
2," Im really proud of them, but what exactly is the order of cultural merit? "
3," For me, it used to be followed by baby dont hurt me but now its I wanna know know know know. "
4," For years my mom has been saying shit like this. Even when my therapist asked if I was feeling suicidal, I said no (even though I was) because I was afraid she would think I was stupid.  "
5," Well my friend showed me bts, but even she wasnt a fan, she just thought their music videos looked cool. And I told one of my other friends about it and she was basically like oh okay thats cool. But other than that, I normally dont tell people about it, because Im afraid as being seen as just another crazy bts fangirl. Especially since my mom seems to get annoyed every time I start talking about them lol. "
6," All I do is eat, sleep, and look at my phone because thats all I have the energy to do.  "
7, I thought it was spelled like PU.  
8," One time I asked for a kids menu because I wanted chicken nuggets but it wasnt on the regular menu, and the lady was like you have to be 10. Are you 10? To this day, I always wonder why I didnt just say I was 10 (I was 13 btw).  "
9," Or when you cant find a partner, so the teacher picks a group for you.  "
10, Boo 
11, Just throw yourself off a fucking cliff.  
12, Hi! 
13," That reminds me when I was eight I had my birthday party at this indoor playground type thing, and someone pooped on the slide.  "
14, The wonder girls opened for the Jonas brothers in 2009. 
15," All you can do is just practice over and over again, and then youll eventually get it.  "
16, Well that took an unexpected twist. 
17, But whats so bad about seedless watermelons? 
18, I love pancake! 
19," My problem is that I am interested in people, but I just never know what to say, so I probably come off as being uninterested.  "
20, Its everyday bro 
21, I think its just ocd trying to mess with you.  
22," I dont know why, but it feels weird to just sleep with one pillow. "
23," I think the most interesting kpop-related thing that happened was that I went to 5 seconds of summers concert and saw these girls with army bombs. 

Haha, yeah that was fun and now Im not that sad about having to miss BTSs concert.  "
24, This is me everyday. 
25," Yeah I suffer from this too. Im too scared to tell anyone about it though in case they actually think Im a pedophile, even my therapist.  "
26, Everything  
27, Riverdale had a fucking musical episode. I just noped the fuck out of there.  
28, I have the old school European except hes African.  
29, Im just happy if I have at least one friend. 
30, At first I was like how does someone like this have friends? Then I read this comment and it makes sense that theyre also gross neckbeards like him. 
31," If you had to pick one gender, which one would it be? "
32, Reminds me in high school when I would eat lunch by myself and people looked at me like they felt bad for me but I didnt really mind at all.  
33," Not a garbage man, but I saw a huge teddy bear in the trash one time. "
34," I always thought having a toad would be really inconvenient.

Did they get mail for their owners? How long would that take?  "
35," Im almost exactly a year older than mark from nct.

So yeah, that was pretty surprising to learn. "
36, I was surprised learning that Victoria is a lot older than the rest of the group... I think she was 22 when f(x) first debuted.  
37," I think its funny how he looks like the maknae, meanwhile sehun, the actual maknae, looks like the oldest member. "
38, r/wowthanksimcured 
39, Yep. Happy birthday! 
40, I thought that was Anthony Padilla at first. 
41," Me when I got into bts:

Okay suga is the green haired one. Got it.

*watches another video*

Fuck which one is suga again? "
42," I dont have a problem with sleeping, but sometimes I forget to eat. "
43, This one kid started masturbating in front of the whole class.  
44, Happy birthday! 
45, Stop being so embarrassing. 
46," I can actually relate to this. I used to be really mean to people too, and i feel really bad about it, and I wish I could apologize to them. 

But I think its good that you admit that you fucked up, because for some people, thats really hard to do.  "
47, Thats a great idea! 
48, I think BTS magic shop was inspired by a book. 
49," Hell, Im 20 and I cant imagine being attracted to a 16 year old.  "
50," I mean, thats one way to stop cramps. "
51, Cant have this problem if you dont have kids. 
52, And dont forget to hit that notification bell! 
53," I was trying to buy lunch one time in high school, then realized I didnt have enough money, so I had to pay for it in coins. "
54, I rehearse saying here while the teacher is taking attendance. 
55, (HUG) 
56, Happy birthday! 
57, Same  
58, Yay! Im proud of you! 
59, I know this feeling so well! I just try to avoid kids because of that. 
60," Hey, remember that show about the fake pigs?
Yeah?
April fools, lol, they were real this whole time. "
61, Thanks mr. skeletal 
62, A little bit. 
63," This is a great idea, but I could never do this because my memory sucks. "
64, Also people who think the holocaust didnt happen. 
65," Yeah I met someone similar to that where they identified as an agender boy... I mean, do what you want, but it was kind of confusing. Also I remember them saying I go by they/them, xie pronouns (or whatever it was...) and I was like yeah Ill just refer to you as they/them. "
66," I mean, I like a lot of the groups from sm entertainment but that doesnt mean Im going to stan the whole company, just the groups. "
67," Yeah Ive been having these types of thoughts since I was 13. I would end up crying and I wanted to smash my head against the wall to make it stop. But since then, Ive learned to just let the thoughts happen, even if theyre disturbing, because trying not to think about it will only make it worse. And also remember that these thoughts dont reflect on you as a person. "
68," The first time I ever heard kpop, I saw this girl in my class jamming out to music, so I asked what she was listening to, and she showed me the mv for exos growl. 

Then I kind of lost interest in kpop for a while, but my friend showed me the mv for blood sweat and tears by bts, and it made me interested in kpop again. 

Also, Jins song epiphany was released on my birthday, which made me very happy. "
69, Yeah. I feel like I dont even get excited about things anymore. 
70," Im also 20 and scared of driving. I dont really know if its related to depression though. But Im always scared of getting into an accident, or that Im being an asshole driver without realizing it. "
71, Georgie is so cute! 
72," I remember when my friend showed me bts for the first time and I was like its cool but probably not something Id listen to all the time.

Fast forward a year and a half later and kpop is pretty much all I listen to. 

I also have a lot of merch and I like to collect albums. "
73, Yeah. Also sometimes I realize that Im actually a real person and its a really weird feeling. 
74," Yeah, I always write comments, worry that it sounds stupid, then just delete the entire thing. "
75, Yay! Im glad to hear hes doing better! 
76, I read this wrong and thought this was Danny devitos cat. 
77, Bone appetit! 
78, Thanks you look better without my glasses too. 
79, People. 
80," Man, I hate when this happens. "
81," Im not mad at you, just disappointed. "
82," Haha, Ive done this too. I woke up and looked at the clock, thought oh shit Im going to be late for school! I changed into another outfit before realizing it was 7 pm. "
83," Yeah, mainly because Im tired all the time, no matter how much sleep I get. Everything makes me tired. "
84, Im the first one. 
85," I remember when I was eleven I was taking some kind of test, and some of the questions were true or false questions. So one of them was like sometimes I hear voices in my head and I said true. Then the lady who gave me the test asked what I meant by that and I was like I can hear my own voice in my head, because I thought thats what it meant. "
86," I have something similar happen where people will randomly ask if Im okay because I look sad. No, its just my face. "
87," I was also thinking of yoongi, because of trivia: seesaw.  "
88, Bonjour! 
89, My perfect what? 
90," Exactly. When I went to LA a few years ago, it took us 7 hours to get there. And its in the same state I live in. "
91, Very often. 
92," In school, I hated when teachers would do this sort of stuff during a test. It just made me even more nervous.  "
93, Guess Ill die  
94, #twobroschillinginthehottubfivefeetapartcausetheyrenotgay 
95," This is basically what happened to me. I tried telling my mom for years that I probably had adhd and she didnt believe me because Im really quiet and I used to read a lot. She thought adhd meant being loud and obnoxious, but anyone can have it. "
96," Oh my god, my sister does this too. I dont use Facebook, but from what Ive heard, she posted a picture of the list of people she blocked and wrote some passive aggressive shit with it. What a drama queen. "
97, This is the most wholesome thing ever. 
98, Me yelling from the back: ITS ACTUALLY BEEN A TOUGH FEW MONTHS 
99, Oh thank god I was worried. 
100, Wow I didnt know that my mind is blown. 
101, Link - Namibia - German- Germany - world war 2 - hitler  
102," That links to Australia, then to Papua New Guinea, then Germany... then you know the rest. "
103, Apparently Ive been doing it wrong. 
104, I love it! Your wife is really talented! 
105, I havent had a chance to see it yet cause Im at school right now- but Im still really proud of them! I cant even put into words how surreal this feels to me. 
106, F(x) and the sm dungeon. 
107, What kind of dog is that? 
108, I would take it the second it was given to me. 
109, Bonjour! 
110, And then being too broke to buy things you actually need. 
111," I dont know if anyone has mentioned this yet, but woozi from seventeen looks like a mini version of yoongi from bts. "
112," One time when I was 9, I saw a cup of apple juice on the counter, and without even questioning it, I took a sip. It tasted a bit stronger than usual, and I was confused until I realized that it wasnt juice... it was wine. "
113, Fuck that bitch Claire. 
114, Im the opposite. Im a 20 year old girl who looks 14. 
115, Ill try not to. 
116," I feel like some people forget that celebrities are people too, and deserve as much respect as normal people do.  "
117," These types of people are the reason why I dont like telling people Im a kpop fan. 

(I swear not all of us are that psychotic, but yeah, some of them are.) "
118, Well Ive never dated anyone before so I guess I dont have to worry about something like that. 
119, Wait is this about license plates? Because I thought you meant the plates you eat off of. 
120, I was being cyberbullied and it just made my depression even worse. 
121, Rest In Peace in peace. 
122, I know. 
123, Youre welcome! 
124, Planned better? Thats so dumb. Its not like you can control your period.  
125," Yeah, Ive actually learned a lot about Korean culture because of kpop.  "
126," Im American and I dont really like talking to strangers.

I feel like I would fit in well in Finland. "
127," My fourth grade teacher. I have lots of stories about how much of a bitch she was, but one that stands out in particular was when we had a spelling test, and she marked all of the answers wrong, even though I spelled all the words right, but apparently they were wrong because I capitalized them when I wasnt supposed to.  "
128," I never thought anything about the food portions because you can just ask for a box in restaurants to take home with you. That is until I went to Japan last summer, and I asked for a box and the waiter just looked really confused.  "
129," My moms a teacher, and one year she had this 8 year old kid in her class who said he was excited to see the new twilight movie because I heard the sex is really good.

Yep, an 8 year old said that. "
130," I have a similar problem. Im really bad at explaining things, and lately Ive been forgetting a lot of things, even really basic things. Its actually starting to get really frustrating, and I just feel really stupid. "
131," I like hermione and Ron together. But I agree with the harry/Ginny thing. To me, they didnt have much chemistry between them. "
132, Why did he wait that long to tell you? 
133, Wow this is so shocking. 
134," Step 1: wait for your parents to leave 
Step 2: take clothes off 

Its really not that difficult. "
135, Stranger things  
136," Wow, that hair color is so beautiful!  "
137, You can pm me if you want to. 
138, Sarahs dad has got it going on... 
139, Isnt ferb adopted? 
140, Howdy 
141," Yes, my two nct biases! "
142," Haha, I do that. "
143, Thats how I feel every day. 
144," BTS- jungkook 
Exo- baekhyun 
Twice- Momo 
Blackpink- Lisa 

At least thats all I can think of for now. "
145," I kind of have the same thing, except its me saying oh shit Im dreaming, I should probably wake up now.  "
146," Thank you! I was cyber bullied in middle school and people would just be like then turn off the computer. I mean, I guess that helps if theyre people you dont know, but these were people I had to see everyday at school. Its not that simple. "
147, Sent from iPhone 
148, One of the supervisors got caught stealing. 
149, Id be happy to have friends. 
150," To be fair, I thought that was a giant ice cream sandwich too, until I saw what it actually was. "
151," I had the opposite problem where whenever I tried to tell people I was being bullied, instead of actually doing anything about it they would tell me its my fault for being shy (which apparently made me an easy target). "
152," In the song irresistible by fall out boy, I thought he was saying too many waffles.

The actual line was too many war wounds. "
153, Im 20 and I can relate to this.  
154, 20 points to ravenclaw  
155, For a second I thought your name was gassy. 
156, Retail. Dont be an asshole. 
157," Im from California, and Im broke as fuck. "
158, It gets worse when theres no way around them. 
159," Cant relate, I dont have friends. "
160, Harriet potter  
161, Shes annoying. 
162, Happy birthday! 
163," I wasnt allowed to watch it either, but only because my mom hated it and thought it was weird. "
164, France? 
165, Oh my god I remember watching that movie on the plane and trying so hard not to cry in front of everyone when that song started playing. 
166," To be honest, I dont see anything wrong with it. "
167, And it takes them 5 minutes just to say that. 
168," As someone who was in the panic! at the disco fandom... never read the milk fic. To this day, Im still reminded of it whenever I even look at milk.

Also this kind of reminds me of something similar happening with Dan and Phil, but like... with more creepy fanfics.  "
169, This is the cutest thing Ive ever read. Im happy for you.  
170, I had a similar experience in middle school where I was obsessed with twilight and I actually wished I was a vampire.  
171, Happy birthday maximus! 
172, This has happened to me more times than Id like to admit. 
173, Hes so cute! And Im glad that you finally get to have a dog. 
174, What sex life? 
175, Remindme! 1 day 
176, Happy birthday! 
177, Yes. You are the good boy. 
178, Suki is a really nice name.  
179, This is the prettiest cat Ive ever seen.
