54," Guess there isn't going to be much better an answer than this. The activism thing sounds interesting, but how can you find out about a lot of different causes going on (especially with a local presence)? I know big names, like Habitat for Humanity and Doctors without Borders, but there's surely a million smaller initiatives out there.

Like I recently learned about a Manatee conservation group via a friend and had the thought ""how would a normal person -- not a crazy Manatee Person -- learn about this group?"" "

309," I definitely will be taking suggestions from those add-ons, especially the YouTube one.

Downside of that article: wtf kind of tip is audio texting? No one is consistently in a place to send an audio text -- it's basically having a phone call in a public place -- and who would even want to receive that? The receiver would need to put in headphones to listen -- otherwise it again becomes practically a public phone call -- and I would not want to place that hassle on anyone. "

313," Building off what others have said: if the sentiment in the photos really speaks to you, then go for it. It can look very good. For example, a pic of a gamer with a Breath of the Wild triptych was floating around recently, and it looked fantastic. But you do want to avoid the ""I need to fill a wall"" feel. "
314," Addendum after reading your other comments about the window:

Talk to your landlord about any improvements they could make. If they won't, head over to r/diy or some diy website for suggestions on what a renter could do about the situation. You don't want to be paying to heat the outside like that! "
315," I saw your updated picture. You've got a good point about the depth of cabinets along that right-hand wall. Perhaps you could consider the space in the back corner where picture #1 had a lamp, trashcan, and computer tower.

Consider the other people's comments about clutter. Clutter just means there's too much going on: the plants make too many visual points of interest for the small space. A bigger room could support that many plants in the living area. Imagine relocating some of them to the windowsills (Why the heck are your pillows there. Put them back on your bed.) and the rest to different parts of the apartment. The set of drawers would then have lesser ""weight"" on that wall.

Location of a bookcase: Ideally it could go behind the room dividers where I'm assuming your bed is. You don't want to move the set of drawers from their current location because the low top makes the sensation of walking from front space to back space more spacious. If you can find a bookcase with feet that heighten it above your baseboard heating fire regulations then you've got more options.

Thoughts on rugs on the carpet: more things on the floor cut up the space and make it look crammed and smaller. You've got an outlet on the left wall so it's obviously not to cover cords.

Final note: in the end, what makes you happy is most important. It doesn't matter if randos on reddit aren't happy with every detail in your room. "
316," Adding more storage is the perfect first step. A bookcase or set of drawers can also serve as room dividers.

A bookcase with doors could hide your printer (and any other office equipment) and minimize the visual impact of your space serving both office and  living room purposes. Concerns about heat can be solved with slats in the cabinet door or large holes in the back panel. "

356," I have not been going out for late night fast food with friends for the past two weeks but instead have been stockpiling snack foods from the cafeteria during dinner as a substitute. (At college dorm.)

379," I'm a level 37 mage so I've been around a bit and had all sorts of interactions. The game started playing battle music exclusively during the Civil War questline (Stormcloak side) when we defeated Balgruuf. Serana was following me at the time because she wanted me to take her to the Soul Cairn. Some people online said Serana aggros everything and she's the problem. I took her to the Soul Cairn, finished the quest there and dismissed her from service, but that didn't change the music situation. I'm getting the music all the time, even inside towns and buildings.

Is there any way to reset the music settings? Reloading the game or previous saves doesn't effect anything. I've run out of ideas on what actions to perform in-game to fix it. What console options do I have? "
380," It's happened to me a few times as well! It doesn't impact anything, and when that time in the quest comes it all goes off without a hitch.

The first half of the post detailed factors you could not change (eg racial discrimination and non-traditional education discrimination) and the second half detailed factors you could change (eg key words in your resume, when you submit the app). In particular I remember two of the things:

* All other factors held equal, job apps submitted Monday 6am-10am have the highest chance of a response

487," Hold on, HRT causes new fat deposits to appear in classically masculine places (belly) but doesn't cause pre-existing fat (hips and thighs) to move. Fat doesn't move in the body. Old fat gets used (hunger or exercise) and new fat gets put into place wherever hormones tell it to.

Also: if HRT caused fat to move, trans-guys wouldn't need to get surgery to remove their chests. But they do need surgery.

497," I think this argument and some variant of ""burden on society"" argument are the two large contenders.

498, Eat the expired canned goods! Canned goods past the expiry are good for several years as long as they aren't punctured! The FDA (if you are US) only requires expiration dates on infant formula.

528," What does ""mirror and speakers"" mean on the left wall? You'd want speakers close to the desk, but your mirror should be close to the wardrobe...

If the mirror is separable from the speakers, I'd recommend swapping the location of the desk and wardrobe,  and put the mirror on the wall to the right of the new dresser location. It separates the two distinct purposes in the space. The speakers by the wardrobe currently confuse those two functions. Also: what direction doors that window face?

Easy example: I can't wear some dress shirts that don't fit me, but donating or selling them send my brain into a spin because *I spent money buying it and don't feel like I've gotten my money's worth out of it yet.* But I know my beer gut is not reducing any time soon. These shirts will not be fitting in the near future.

Perhaps it can be boiled down to a fear of failure? If I get rid of something before I've gotten my money's worth -- lose money on a deal -- then I am a failure. I don't want to be a failure.

If you don't know that, then use descriptions of their clothing/hair. Don't call them black.

Some people self-identify as Negro, but even if they do, do not call them that. Words have different meanings when you call yourself the term versus when someone else calls you the term.

 Where is perfection, with OP in the face of hoarding. Clearly the solution isn't in complacently doing nothing about our shortcomings, but Nanyue argues it's not in doing something either. Why?

We're discussing a mentality someone is in, in regards to their actions? Nanyue is saying zen is not about doing for doing sake. It is about what motivates you to do the action. What motivates OP to have many possessions or few possessions? What motivates OP then gather more or discard more possessions?

I fashioned a self-standing curtain rod/rack and threaded on the curtain. The curtain could be pushed aside for when the rest of the room needed the couch. Make some measurements of how tall you want the rack to be when you're standing and how you want to deal with the ends of your bed/couch.

957," The real facepalm is that this is a satire article and OP thinks it's real.

962," ""Plot Area"" "
963, That's awesome and well-constructed! It'll be a pain in the ass when you need to move though. (But all furniture is.)

970, (happy cake day) 
971, Could someone from /r/chemicalreactiongifs lend us a hand explaining this? 
972, This took me longer to figure out than it should have. 
973, Down for me :( 
974," Tater = potato

984," If a tv + stand is entering the room, then your suggestion is pretty solid. Bed faces tv and windows. 

Personally I'd put the wardrobe and dresser on the wall where the bed is currently to free up the visual space of the immediate area you see when you enter the room. Dark bulky furniture would really consume that space but an airy desk would be open and welcoming.  "
985, How do you lock your place of abode? 
986, R/wehaveseenthebutthole?

993, Drat! I shall fix this! 
994," To unfurl what I am discussing: I would stop munching on common, plump fowl or it's unborn young. Although potato chips would roost in my pantry and broccoli and asparagus would stay in my building, I must banish particular rations coming forth from a cow's body from my sight, for this activity is dictating that violating AVoid5 in my food is unholy.

How about you? "
995," ""Percentage professors married""

We'll have an intellectual conversation about the impacts of work life balance and how it shows in the percentage of married professors versus the rest of the population. "

Here's a fun one! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODj9dMrFMpg "
997, Where can I learn to do THAT? 
998," I feel drawn by frugality and a sense of freedom. Frugality because I'm poor (an easy response) and freedom because the idea of having materials possessions -- that you don't need to live your life to its fullest extent -- surround you and suffocate you and tie you down is extremely unappealing.

I'm currently in college so I'm trying to start out my life right instead of having to go back and ""repair"" it. (A decent analogy could to be: i want to be fit from the get-go instead of becoming unfit and then needed to lose weight.) "
999," 13. Some reports indicate we consume twice as many material goods today as we did 50 years ago

This is my draw to minimalism (I'm new here): it is the realization that people led just as full lives 50 years ago as they attempt to do today, but with much less clutter surrounding them and consumed by them. "
1000, Woah cool!
