9," I understand what you mean now, and I do agree that they don't deserve to be burned alive, but at the same time they don't not deserve it. The protester seemed to have thrown the molotov in their general area and it hit her. You can't fault the protester for doing that as he feels that change needs to happen, and sometimes it needs to happen through violence. "
10," Sorry, english isn't my first language so I might have misunderstood what you said. Can you show me how I am wrong here? "
11," I'm not one of those ""acab"" people. In my country (Italy) the police is quite brutal but most of them aren't. I don't condemn violence towards all police as they usually do more good than bad. 

There are circumstances where acab is applicable though. A government that uses its police force to gun down protesters is pretty shitty. I'd rather be a ""tankie CTH (idk what this is) idiot than a person trying to defend a police force murdering random civilians. "
12," Do you realise that even if you are a cop you most likely can't sustain your family (in chile). A cop earns probably minimum wage and with the situation in Chile it most likely means that they can't support themselves and their families (thus the protests). The only reason why a government like Chile's still has power and control is because of the armed forces and police. By just sitting there idly as a police officer, even if you don't personally shoot anyone, means that you have no regard for human lives as you keep on helping and supporting a corrupt and terrible government. 

I don't understand why you say you'd just show up and not be effective, do you realise that workers can be fired right? If a cop friend is getting beat up and you sit there and watch don't you think you'd be in some kind of trouble? The same trouble you said you were afraid of in the 1st line. 

Personally, I'd like to think that I wouldn't just sit there idly while my own citizens who I am tasked with protecting are getting gunned down by the police, but hey maybe it's just cause I'm a random zoomer on reddit, and apparently a ""tankie CTH idiot"" (whatever that means). "
13," Don't you think that if you are aware of your own police force shooting unarmed people they'd feel some kind of remorse and quit? You know, being a decent human being and all that. Of course that one person probably wasn't guilty of shooting anyone, but they are still associating and being part of the police force that does do that "
14," police: shoots at random protesters

15," My dad is fat, if it helps. I'm non-binary and my grandparents, aunt, and mother are religious. "
16," Hi guys, on mobile so sorry for bad formatting, also using a throwaway yadda yadda.

So last week I (M17) went to a restaurant (genderless6) to eat out with my mother (F54) my father (M55) my grandparents (M86   F74), my aunt (F51) and my dog (M9). 
At some point through our delicious 5 star meal, the man sitting next to our table said he felt like killing random people. Of course I immediately stood up and told him that it's not right to do something like that. 
Everyone immediately clapped and started cheering as they thought I was NTA. The restaurant manager apologised for that guy's rudeness and I got the meal for free.
After getting back home my dog (M9) told me that he thought I was TA because I shamed an innocent man in front of a whole restaurant, so am I the asshole? "
17," Don't worry I'm Italian, you don't have to teach me how to avoid paying taxes "
18, You should try avoiding taxes instead 
19," The graph above is about people's qualities, not about positive things and thus I don't think Gandhi deserves a spot in the love section at all. I understand Buddha being there as he was loving to all people, but a person like Gandhi who was wildly a racist, sexist and homophobe doesn't deserve a spot there. 

As for your quote, it's one of the dumbest things I've heard. Should we remember Hitler for reducing unemployment or the holocaust? We remember both the good and bad of people cause that's how we form opinions on people. We can't simply ignore all the bad that people have done just to look at the good they did. Winston Churchill is considered a war hero but he also diverted food supplies from the Raj to British soldiers which led to many famines. 

Sure Gandhi played a huge role in India's independence and for that he should be rewarded but he was also a horrible, nasty little man and instead of ignoring that part of him we should educate people on it.

A person can't really be both loving and not loving at once though can they? A person that is loving wouldn't call black people dirty animals like Gandhi did. Was he a patriot? Sure. Did he love his country? Sure. But he sure as hell wasn't loving overall. "
20," But he is not an artist. He managed to liberate india from colonial rule but it doesn't mean he wasn't a pos. Everything ranging from calling black people animals and very dirty, calling hitler a dear friend, giving enemas to young women and making young women sleep naked with him. "
21," He was fundamentally a dick head overall though. I don't see how a racist and a pedo can be under ""love"" in any way "
22, Gandhi: a racist pedo but apparently is the best of all

26," To add on to this, I've been spinning for a while but only know the 4 fundamentals. I don't really enjoy sitting down and watching tutorials so I don't really have the chance to learn new tricks but I've been happy at the level I'm at currently. Sometimes it's way more fun to figure stuff out on your own instead of tutorials. "
27, I was out on a day trip in Mantova and I captured this shot while walking around a park soon before having to leave.

48," Imagine there's a huge terrorist attack and since the terrorist hasn't been sentenced you never find out stuff about it. People would miss so many things that are going on in the world. A better solution would be to write as unbiased as possible, not censor the media "

60," Well, using your logic, all a rapist has to do is claim they have never done said action and we must immediately believe them. I was wrong to say that cause there's no reliable source to prove that she did sexually assault them but just cause she said she didn't do it doesn't mean she's telling the truth "

72," This is pretty recent but 
I was coming home from school and my dad picked me up at the metro to bring me home. He starts asking the same question and every time I answered with ""no thanks"" . After I told him there was no reason to ask me the same exact thing 8 whole times in a row and he just goes ballistic. He tells me that I shouldn't be treating him like shit etc.
When we finally arrive home he tells me that I'm a schitzo and that I need to go back to my ""schitzo doctor"" (basically just my psychologist that I go to cause of anxiety and depression). 
Skip to 3 days later and I told him that I thought it was pretty rude to call me a schitzo since I didn't do anything wrong and he tells me that it's no different than calling him rude cause he was asking me the same question. 
He has since not apologised (definitely not the first time) but I'd acting like nothing ever happened and that we're best buds

127, Thanks so much! Several friends and my SO are what have been helping me these past months and I can't thank them enough. I wish the world wasn't as shitty so that no one would have to go through this. Lots of people in foster care here are beaten and mistreated so I fear that it wouldn't be too good for me. I just have 2 years left and thanks to people like you I know I can do it! 
128," My dad has choked me out two times now, one time because i closed my bedroom door while I was hanging out with my friend. Other times he has tripped me on the stairs for no reason other than enjoyment and I had to get stitches cause I hit my head pretty hard. I'm afraid to call the cops or do anything as I do not want to lose my chance in life to do good and I'm also afraid I'd lose all my friends and especially gf (we're long distance). All I have is two years left and then I can finally get out of here. Thanks so much for the support. As for the rest of the post I totally understand why people were calling me TA and I understand that i shouldn't have assumed when they'd be back etc. "
129," I understand, I should have not expected them to be home when i wanted or make any kind of assumptions and it was wrong of me "
130," I totally agree with being TA cause of expecting them to come back home early and that they didn't check my phone, I only added that part when people asked me why I didn't prepare food on my own "
131," Thank you so much, you have no idea how much this helps me. I'm planning on leaving for university as soon as I finish my school and to find a job for the next two years. I plan to essentially cut them out as soon as I can and go live with my girlfriend in Ireland at 18/19. "

134," Thank you, they often punish me for extremely silly things. One day my dad said all chinese people eat dogs and some other racist stuff and when I said it wasn't true he left me to walk back home on the side of the highway and it took me about an hour. "

136," They weren't by themselves, they were having an appetizer thing with their friends and also a couple of my friends (including my bff) and they didn't invite me as they usually do. "
137," I forgot to add, i asked them beforehand and said it wouldn't take too long. I don't mind so much about not answering my texts as the consequences that could have happened if I had eaten something else before they came back. "
138," Of course I didn't expect them to be that fast although it was only an appetizer which consists of crisps and snacks. I asked them how long it would take before they left and said it wouldn't take too long, I totally understand if they wanted to stay more but at least tell me. "
139," I'm 16 and all there was left in our house was some fruit, apple and some pasta. If I had eaten the pasta instead and not eaten the sushi they would have potentially beaten me or yelled at me / gotten very angry for it which is why I didn't prepare anything "

155," I'm not saying women aren't likely to get raped or assaulted sexually or robbed or killed, I literally said that her reaction was normal in that situation cause bad things happen, but saying that men don't understand fear is silly "
156," Well yeah it's more likely to be a woman, but that doesn't change the fact that men are statistically more in danger than women. I think the OP is NTA cause her reaction was normal, but to say that women are in more danger and that men don't understand is silly "

301, So I started talking to this girl from Reddit and after a few weeks of talking on and off on discord (not voice chat) she sent me pictures of her feet at 1 or 2 am. After that I told her that I didn't really appreciate those pictures and I didn't write anything to her after that. She sent me a message a while back saying hello but I never answered. AITA

401," Here is my steam [profile](https://steamcommunity.com/id/boboboboboboobobob/)

I am currently posting this again as my other post was deemed to short, so here's my effort to write a bit more.

I'd like to request the game called Black Desert Online. It is a popular MMORPG that has gone one sale as the steam summer sales began. The game's description is as follows:  Black Desert Online is a sandbox, living-world MMORPG. Experience fast-paced, action-packed combat, hunt monsters and huge bosses, fight with friends in a guild to siege nodes and conquer castles, train your life skills such as fishing, trading, crafting, cooking, and much more! 

I'd love this game as I've tried it once at my friends house and loved it, for the past weeks I've been researching a bit more about it and how the game works and I am currently very into the premise of it. Personally the fishing and conquering castles is the most fun part for me as it differentiates it from the other MMORPG I've tried. I've wanted to try and get into MMORPG's but never had the time to (school and weekly therapy sessions), so now that I'm soon on summer break I hope to have the time to get into this game and enjoy it! This game currently has mixed reviews but having it tried it once, I can say that I positively say that I enjoy this game and will play it until I'm somewhat of a decent player.

I know I will be able to run the game as my PC specs are good. If anyone else has this game already then you are welcome to add me and maybe we can even play together sometime!  
Thanks to anyone that would even consider giving me this game, you are a very generous person and I seriously thank you. "
