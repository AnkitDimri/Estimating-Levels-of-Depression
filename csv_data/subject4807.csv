0," Coding is a really valuable skill.

Have you considered volunteering and teaching it to others? I've personally found fulfillment in helping others learn to code. It's fun and free.

Incidentally, one of the people who helped me learn to program was doing so because he head a disease that was going to render him braindead in ten years, so he decided to give back by teaching others. "
1, Cute 
2," I'm so happy for you. I feel the same way after getting my eyes fixed almost three years ago. There are so many small day-to-day life improvements I've gotten to experience as a result. For example, falling asleep watching tv with my contacts in used to be a major mistake as I'd later have to pry stale contacts off my eyeballs while half asleep. Now, it's just falling asleep. "
3, :( 
4, The only way you can tell it's a replica is that it's being held up. 
5, Weird flex but ok 
6," Well let's see... pretty good: I've showered, swept the spiderwebs off my patio, and put away my clothes. Big moves over here. "
7," Doing great, thanks for asking. Hope youre well! "

9, What up 
10," I highly recommend leaving the ones that make you feel bad. I prune my subs from time to time for a variety of reasons, and it's worked really well for me.

In fact, that's one of the reasons subreddits exist at all in the first place. One of the first subreddits I made was r/politics, and I made it because even though I was interested in the subject, I found I was starting every day pissed off and didn't like it. This was back around 2005, maybe 2006. The front page, which had been mostly programming and internet culture content until then, was being overrun with angry politics. Creating r/politics gave that content a home where it could thrive without drowning out the rest.

I now have a couple of [custom feeds](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/bpfyx1/introducing_custom_feeds_plus_a_community_contest/) that I use depending on my mood, and would love to see us invest more in this line of features. "

12," subject4807 here, at your service: 1,000 coins to delete. 2,000 to edit. PM me. Only available on holidays. "
13," Maybe for you, but for me, they only become more desirable. "
14," I used to turn to the [99 Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems) when learning a new language. If you can do them all, I'm sure you'll find a full-time gig programming Prolog in no time. "
15," Whenever I go through a rough patch, I try to remember all the rough patches I've been through already, and all the high points and happy memories in between them. Then I remind myself that every rough patch has so far eventually been followed by good times and that whatever it is, this too shall pass. And it does. "
16," I think I read this on r/wholesomememes a while ago, but it's stuck with me:

*The secret to having good friends is to be a good friend.*

You can't control their feelings and actions towards you, but you can control your feelings and actions towards them. If you make the effort, give them a call, plan things, invite them, I suspect you'll find what you're looking for, whether clarity or friendship. "
17, Then they should definitely stay. Our interns are pretty good. 
18," I really like where I'm working and the work I'm doing

It's hard to find this, so I'd give strong consideration to staying.

And what does it mean to be stuck? You'd only be stuck if this was the only job available, and if this is the only job available, you have no options anyway. "
19," In the beginning...

It was one upvote for one karma point. That's still the basis, I believe, but just as post and comment scoring have some restrictions to prevent cheating (e.g. IP limits), karma scoring has even more.

The biggest gap between karma scoring and post scoring is we undid a (outdated) restriction on post scoring that is still on karma scoring. u/keysersosa wrote a post about it a couple years ago.

u/keysersosa, correct me if I'm wrong, but in theory we could bring karma scoring in line with post scoring if we weren't so busy otherwise ruining Reddit and whatnot. "
20," I actually felt really bad about saying ""shitty little things"" but I'm happy it was heard with the spirit it was intended. I love the shitty ones. "
21," To echo many people here, yes, thats been my experience as well. I have little arches now after having comically flat feet my whole life. 

Even better, I can wear shoes pain free that I previously could not (e.g. Vans). 

I find that simply walking is not enough. Its running consistently for a month of so that reveals these benefits. "
22," Video games were a huge part of growing up for me until World of Warcraft, which was so rich and deep that I effectively fell out of gaming after I stopped playing because everything else felt hollow. Until Zelda BOTW. It was the first game in a decade that brought back the fun and excitement of gaming as a kid. "
23," Nah, dude. You are free to use Reddit on whatever platform you like best. "
24," When I was programming every day, one of the things I was thankful for was having a job that allowed me to listen to music all day, not to mention the effect that music I loved would have on my mood, so there were benefits beyond just drowning out outside noise.

One technique that worked well for me was to listen to the same couple of albums over and over. While the songs had words that could otherwise be distracting, I had listened to them so many times that they effectively became white noise for me. "
25, I bought these immediately after seeing them here the first time a few months ago. I had a fantasy of power scrubbing every surface of my house that has yet to materialize. But Im ready. 
26, This post got me thinking what an reclaim old account feature might look like. The need for it is increasing... 
27," I'd be supportive of once a year or so. We can technically do it now, but I think there are bunch of little edge cases we'd need to explore before making it real. It could be an interesting Premium/Gold feature to allow it more often. "
28," For example, lowering rate limits, lowering prices, or other things that would be nice for someone who has contributed to their communities. "
29, Its possible for a feature to both be fun and generate revenue. 
30," Ill take that bet. While we are exploring more ways to earn karma and more benefits to having karma, we have no plans to sell karma. Karma is reputation, and reputation must be earned. "
31," Thank you, Senator.

As it relates to r/the_donald specifically, we watch them closely, and we do our best to hold them to the same standards and policies as we do all communities. Before we action any community, we also speak to moderators regarding rule breaking behaviors. To that end, we have removed a number of their moderators over the years for not moderating to our standards, and we wouldnt hesitate to do this again, or take additional steps, should their behavior warrant it. While they can be offensive and antagonistic to the rest of Reddit, we have not found them to be in consistent violation of our content policies.

Yes, we do see individual posts and comments that cross the line, but the offending content also gets removed as we ask and expect, and we also take action against those individual users and accounts with suspensions or full bans from the site as appropriate.

I wish there was a solution that was as simple as banning the communitycertainly it would make some things easierbut the reality is that banning a large political community that isnt in violation of our policies would be hugely problematic, not just for Reddit, but for our democracy generally. Political speech is the most protected form of speech in the United States, and we are sensitive to that and take cues from the government when we think about our policies.

I know this isnt the answer many of you are looking for, but as we continue to deliberate and evolve our thinking, my hope is that you appreciate the complexity of this situation and understand our approach. "
32," what can be done to curb manipulation by foreign entities on social media during election cycles?

Pasting from my [previous answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/bwpqqi/we_are_us_senator_ron_wyden_and_reddit_ceo_steve/epzexlh/):

Our primary focus is to detect and stop coordinated or otherwise inauthentic behaviors. Towards that end, weve increased accounts banned for content manipulation by 250% since 2017, and weve increased the rate at which we proactively action accounts from 29% in 2017 to 99% today. Additionally, we have built tools to help moderators proactively combat community interference (ne brigading) that are in alpha testing, and weve built a new reliable reporter system to surface information to our threat team even quicker.

Is there a way to recognize and eliminate bots?

Yes, though detecting and mitigating the impact of bots is a bit of an arms race. As our capabilities get better, the adversary also gets better. 

Detection today is reliant on technical indicators (such as IP) and leveraging our data scientists to detect abnormal behavior.

One common vector of attack is to hack otherwise legitimate dormant or insecure accounts and then use them to manipulate Reddit. Working against that, we have focused on improving account security to prevent malicious bots from taking over these accounts. Please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/bletrr/how_to_keep_your_reddit_account_safe/) for how you can help improve the security of your account

Of course, not all bots are bad bots: r/subredditsimulator, automod, auto crossposting news bots, etc. One option is to ask helpful community bots to self-identify, leaving the potentially malicious bots for us to deal with. "
33," For Steve Huffman, what are some policy changes that can happen on the company level that protect democracy but still stay true to the company's visions?

Reddits greatest strengths are our users and communities, who are our first line of defense. That communities can create their own rules and enforce them and that users can reject content and behaviors through downvotes and social pressure is very powerful.

Using fake news as an example, we think it is problematic for a private company, or even worse, me as an individual, or the government, to decide which news sources are valid and which are not. Communities, however, are free to choose which news sources they accept and reject. In fact, our news communities are among our most aggressively moderated. There is a huge difference between a private company deciding what is and isnt news vs our users doing the same thing.

That said, we do our best to fight coordinated or inauthentic content, working on both the policy and product fronts to prevent our voting systems from being abused while at the same time increasing the sophistication of community governance, and banning / limiting users that try to manipulate our systems and communities. "

Furthermore, you can check out r/RedditSecurity for updates to our efforts on this. "
35, Flair me first. 
36, Thank god now we can talk about last year. 
37," Here's a couple to get started: 

If this keeps them quiet, we can invest more. "
38," Well... ummm... you see... it's been busy around here. Honestly, I'd still love to do it (with limitations), but we just haven't gotten around to it. "
39," We don't like it, but we haven't provided an alternative solution. They live in a grey area.

One thing we're going to make better use of is the idea of ""community karma."" It'll be useful for helping communities grow safely while keep trolls and abusers at bay. "
40, We've given as much information in the report as we can give you (but we rejected the request). 
41," Presently, we're comically (and frustratingly) manual. The team the handles DMCA requests is the team that wrote the Transparency Report, and it is a LOT of work.

We're working on tooling now to automate much of the tedium, but humans will remain in the loop. "
42," You just outed yourself on Reddit, you brave soul!

LOVED the paper. I thought your approach of comparing models across communities to find common sentiments was really clever, and I'd love to see us incorporate that into Reddit itself. "
43," These words, which were not mine, were in defense of sexualized pictures of young girls. Child porn is a real crime in the United States, and sexualizing minors is an adjacent behavior, and not only is it not welcome on Reddit, it's explicitly forbidden.

I have made many arguments in my career in defense of Free Speech and continue to do so, but there are limits, and this is one of them. "
44," Not a silly question at all. We did a ton of research during design and development, and we continue to do so. We bring people into the office, run surveys, and run a lot of online A/B tests.

Overall, the redesign retains new users at a much better rate than the original site. One of our most important metrics is D1 retention: how many users come back the next day after visiting the site for the first time.

 "
45," I thought it would be funny on r/the_donald, and that really backfired. "
46," No. It was mostly porn, and I think one about drugs. "
47,"  Why do I have to opt-out of the redesign over and over again?

This is a hugely annoying and embarrassing bug. We believe we've fixed most of the causes, but to be certain, we've rewritten the entire system that directs traffic to the old site vs the new site to both work as expected and to be a lot faster, and that should launch soon (days, not weeks)

 And which moron came up with it anyway?

Me. We wanted to both bring new users to the new site but also give all users a choice indefinitely, which made things technically complex.

That said, we are all frustrated that we didn't do a better job here. "
48," Good question. We're updating that as we speak.

Update: updated. "
49," We're working on a lot of stuff right now. Pretty much every aspect of Reddit is under some sort construction, and we're seeing a lot of nice progress. Even compared to a couple months ago, Reddit is faster; we've added a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Changelog%20%3Asnoo_hearteyes%3A%22 restrict_sr=1) of [features](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/); and have made quite a bit of progress on the Anti-Evil / Security side of the house (a post about which will come on Friday). 

So, even if we don't do anything new, we're making plenty of progress already, and I don't want to derail that. "
50," It's not easy, but mostly because government regulations often don't factor in the technical realities of their implementations.

That said, it's easier for us than others because we don't actually have a lot of non-public data about our users. "
51, It's the same API. Higher rate-limits. 
52," In the immediate future, nothing. One of the risks of raising a lot of money is that it can be disruptive to strategy and culture, so we will overcompensate by aggressively sticking to our pre-funding plan.

Down the road, it does give us flexibility to take bigger bets or try new things, but we don't have any specific plans. "
53," It's a fair question to ask. Tencent is a global investor who have invested in many [successful internet companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent#2011%E2%80%932014:_Early_investments).

Our governance didn't change during this round, which means we didn't add anyone to the board, and our policies won't be changing either. "
54," We don't sell any private user data, though we do sell access to an API to more easily access already publicly available content.

How you data is used is documented in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy-may-25-2018). "
55,"  Will you ever modify or remove content to appease your new Chinese investors?

No

 Can you commit to never doing so?

Yes "
56," Two reasons:

1. We have more users and content
2. We receive much more attention compared to last year "
57," Any investor expects a return on their investment, but as I mentioned in the post, nothing about our governance or policies is changing as a result of this investment. "
58," Fair enough.

There are different requirements for different types requests, which are documented in our [Law Enforcement Guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines).
 "
59, Do you really want me to explain that and make it easier for them? 
60," Hi all,

Today weve posted our latest [Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2018).

The purpose of the report is to share information about the requests Reddit receives to disclose user data or remove content from the site. We value your privacy and believe you have a right to know how data is being managed by Reddit and how it is shared (and not shared) with governmental and non-governmental parties.

Weve included a breakdown of requests from governmental entities worldwide and from private parties from within the United States. The most common types of requests are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. In 2018, Reddit received a total of 581 requests to produce user account information from both United States and foreign governmental entities, which represents a 151% increase from the year before. We scrutinize all requests and object when appropriate, and we didnt disclose any information for 23% of the requests. We received 28 requests from foreign government authorities for the production of user account information and did not comply with any of those requests.

This year, we expanded the report to included details on two additional types of content removals: those taken by us at Reddit, Inc., and those taken by subreddit moderators (including Automod actions). We remove content that is in violation of our site-wide policies, but subreddits often have additional rules specific to the [purpose, tone, and norms of their community](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~sjhaver3/The-internets-hidden-rules-cscw2018.pdf). You can now see the breakdown of these two types of takedowns for a more holistic view of company and community actions.

In other news, you may have heard that we closed an additional round of funding this week, which gives us more runway and will help us continue to improve our platform. What else does this mean for you? Not much. Our strategy and governance model remain the same. Andof coursewe do not share specific user data with any investor, new or old.

Ill hang around for a while to answer your questions.

Steve

 #x200B;

edit: Thanks for the silver you cheap bastards.

update: I'm out for now. Will check back later. "
61," A couple years ago, I was wondering this exact question.

Ups and downs are something we've had since *nearly* the first version of Reddit (but not the very first version: early iterations had words instead of arrows, but words were too subjective and restrictive).

Anyway... a couple years ago I considered the idea that downvotes were purely destructive, and that we'd be better off without them. My reasoning was that it feels bad to receive downvotes, and getting downvoted is an especially poor experience if you're a new user. If our goal is to make Reddit more welcoming and accessible, we were working against ourselves. Also, downvotes are weaponized by users and communities to harass and brigade, further compounding the problem.

However, despite their flaws, downvotes are a critical tool for communities to develop and maintain their voice, and without them we couldn't scale moderation. There are only so many moderators and far fewer admins, and by allowing community members to moderate content in a lightweight way, they can develop their own identities and voice and keep out the junk (most of it at least).

I know downvotes have their flaws, but they've been critical to growth of every large subreddit, making addressing their flaws supremely important. Improving downvotes is one of our current initiatives, and hopefully you'll feel the changes in the coming weeks if you haven't felt them already. "
62," Most of my accounts are 13 years old at this point, so that kinda gives me away. "
63," Ive had a great weekend, indeed. Hope your show was good! "
64," Well this is a nice surprise. Works for me.

u/keysersosa can you please take a look? "
65," I'll chat with the team. Unfortunately, I'm no longer allowed to write code over Thanksgiving. "
66," This is great. There are some really good ideas in here that we might be able to make easier for you.

For example, what do you think about a feature to sync headlines (maybe automatically, or automatically add a flair and allowing a mod to edit?). This has always been complicated for a variety of reasons (title shenanigans on Reddit, and inconsistent publishers), but I think your specific use-case might be a good one to work with to make things easier, whether fancy tech or manual mod editing. "
67," Sure, I can see how one would interpret it that way. Let me provide another way of looking at things:

Whether in an AMA or interview or in person, not only am I happy to answer hard questions, I generally look forward to it. It's in my nature to do so, often to my own detriment ([example](https://new.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/dx5go62/)), but I do look for questions that meet two criteria: questions that are asked politely, and asked in a manner that suggests the questioner will actually attempt to listen to my response (even if we have zero chance of agreeing).

In my AMA yesterday, I didn't see much of either, especially as it relates to r/the_donald. I did attempt to leave a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75s1o8/) [responses](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9ld746/you_have_thousands_of_questions_i_have_dozens_of/e75wos8/) on the topic, and I have attempted to other respond many times in the past, but since my answer is never ""yep, they're getting banned,"" I end up buried. So it goes.

It's really isn't my intention to ignore people. I'll probably do another AMA in the near future, and if someone wants to ask simply ""why don't you ban r/the_donald?"" I'll do my best to answer honestly and politely, though my answer will probably look a lot like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7u2zpi/not_my_first_could_be_my_last_state_of_the/dth6eq9/?utm_content=permalink utm_medium=front utm_source=reddit utm_name=announcements).

Anyway, long story short, if u/2Grateful2BHateful or any of you want to say Hi this weekend, I'm more than happy to chat about this or anything else. It'll be fine, might even be pleasant.

 #x200B; "
68, Yep. Come say hi.  
69," Got it. Annoying. Will follow up on this.

Update: there was a lingering experiment that is now turned off. "
70," Breaches do happen, even to the best, as you point out. We've had a couple over the years, one of which we [shared](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/93qnm5/we_had_a_security_incident_heres_what_you_need_to/) a few months ago.

In addition to the standard best practices, we have a philosophical approach to storing as little personal information as possible. With limited exception, we don't know your names, addresses, genders, dob's, phone numbers, ssn's, or other sensitive information. We can't lose what we don't have.

I've always liked the saying ""the best logs are no logs,"" which I believe came from the EFF. "
71," (some of this I wrote elsewhere in the thread, but it's also relevant here)

In addition to updating the policy, we updated the tool as well. We may use it for both of the cases you mention.

The first version of quarantine was basically a death sentence for a community because it required community members to have verified email addresses. We decided that if we want to ban a community, we should just do so outright.

The quarantine feature is now much more flexible, allowing us to apply a variety of sanctions to a community, including an interstitial page, which is what is applied to WPD.

While we do believe a warning page is appropriate for WPD as the content there can be quite disturbing, I do regret lumping them in with the other toxic communities because the mods at WPD have been completely collaborative with us.

All quarantined communities continue to be subject to our site-wide content policies. "
72," 1) What are you referring to? Only new users see it by default. Most everyone else needs to opt in.

2) They've been gone a while, but we are chasing down an issue with incognito users seeing it more often. Please let me know if that's the case, or if you are having a different experience.*

3) Historically it has been optional, and it technically still is, though we're reconsidering it. While I was the original proponent of no-emails, we've found it to be problematic for a couple of reasons over the years: lost account passwords take time for our team to resolve, no emails makes tracking abuse more difficult, and there's more pressure than ever to fight such abuse, and it's generally helpful to be able to reach users where they are with important notifications.

4) Have heard this one before, and we're considering a couple other approaches. I didn't notice myself because my icons are always orange.

*Update: there was a lingering experiment that is now turned off. "
73," Thanks for the question, and thanks for hanging with us. Help is coming.

We know these kinds of accounts have been a problem, and theyre not easy for moderators to deal with alone. Weve talked a bit elsewhere about a relatively new team weve spun up to deal with content manipulation. While their focus has been largely on political manipulation, many of the same tools and methods theyre developing are also effective against these kinds of spam networks. As those things work their way into production, we hope youll see far less of these accounts in your subreddits.

One of the specific focuses of the Anti-Evil team going forward is to ""reduce janitorial work"" for our team and moderators alike.

Similarly, improved tools that don't require as much technical knowledge are on the roadmap. "

78," **as it relates to the_donald**

Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

This does not mean we are not going to enforce our content policy on the_donald, nor does it mean we don't expect full cooperation from the mods in doing so.

**regarding the Russian interference post from a couple weeks ago**

We didn't remove anything. The [user removed the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/9hqzb5/rfuckthealtright_mod_made_a_detailed_post_of_his/e6e4dzf/), and resubmissions of that post were removed as spam because some of the domains in the post were subsequently banned by us. "
79," We're strengthening the measures we have in place to limit the impact of any malicious actors. 

Here are a few of them:

* dedicated teams that enforce our policies, proactively go after bad actors, and create eng solutions to prevent them in the future,
* a new team specifically devoted to investigating efforts to manipulate our site,
* were working on improving communication to/from this team with a trusted reporter system and increasing our presence in subreddits where users are already investigating suspicious activity \[link: [investigations@reddit.zendesk.com](mailto:investigations@reddit.zendesk.com)\], 
* working with industry peers (and parts of the government working to ensure election security) to help us detect and stop emerging malicious activity
* As weve always done, well also have an in-house ""war room"" monitoring for suspicious activity around election day.

In the meantime, transparency is also critical, to help educate users and the public about techniques bad actors are trying out. We've been forthcoming about suspected influence campaigns with you (recent examples: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/)) and will continue to do so as needed. "
80," You send can suspicious accounts to investigations@reddit.zendesk.com, and it will get to the right people. "
81, [Well...](https://media.giphy.com/media/5t9wJjyHAOxvnxcPNk/source.gif) 
82," I spend the majority of my time doing four things:

* Working with our product teams to improve Reddit, which these days is focused on how do we make Reddit more accessible to new users
* Recruiting
* Communicating internally to the company about what we're doing and why we're doing it
* Taking my lumps with the community, which is what I'm doing right now "
83," My [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/) documented exactly what we know and what we're doing about foreign influence on Reddit. We also listed the accounts that were involved so that you can see for yourself what they were up to.

In August, we wrote a [similar post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/) regarding an Iranian attempt at manipulation.

A couple weeks ago, we saw another round of posts centered around usareally.com, which is now banned. What we found in this case was that the users behind it were indeed of Russian origin, though we have no technical evidence that they are affiliated with the IRA. Similar to the IRA's previous efforts, this group's efforts were largely not effective: They submitted 953 posts to 130 different communities. Of the 264 posts submitted to r/the_donald, only one made it into the top 100, and 0 made it into the top 25.

We have a team dedicated to finding and preventing coordinated behavior to manipulate Reddit. The first question whenever we find anything is, ""what could we have done to find this sooner?"" In this case, we would have liked to have caught and banned the domains sooner because they were behaving in a spammy matter, and have adjusted our processes to do so going forward.

84," You're linking to a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/9ksmno/simply_put_the_democrats_are_a_party_of_terrorists/e71ziol/) that was removed by mods before it got any traction on a post that was also removed mods.

As long as the mods of that community continue to cooperate with us in enforcing our site-wide rules, they're not going to see a ban. "
85," We dialed that way back a couple weeks ago. It should be just a little button now.

One thing that might be happening for folks is seeing more prompts because they use incognito because we're losing the cookie that stores whether they've seen the prompt. We're dialing it back for incognito as well in the near future. "
86," We still support i.reddit.com, so you've got some time. "
87," We do, in fact. We wrote a [lengthy post](https://www.reddit.com/r/beta/comments/9iu1ax/we_conducted_an_opt_out_survey_on_new_reddit_here/) about how we collect and respond to feedback just last week.

tl;dr: about 70% of user are on the redesign, and the top two complaints are ""change aversion"" and ""performance"".

Long story short, we hear it, we see it, and we've been working hard to make the redesign great. The top priority for us right is performance, and we've made quite a bit of improvement over the last month. "
88," EDIT:

Your original comment was:

 What is one thing you which you had introduce to reddit sooner but didn't.

You've since edited it to be about r/the_donald. It's disingenuous to edit your comment after I've answered and not admit that you did so.

My original answer:

One thing we really haven't nailed yet is onboarding. We have incredible breadth and depth in our communities that isn't well represented in r/popular, which is what new users see when they first arrive to Reddit. I think we can do a much better job highlighting what Reddit's all about. "
89," Update: I've got to take off for now. I hear the anger today, and I get it. I hope you take that anger straight to the polls next month. You may not be able to vote me out, but you can vote everyone else out.



Hello again!

Its been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.

We started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).

We also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. Im always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). 

Speaking of bans, youve probably noticed that over the past few months weve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. Weve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust   Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and were working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).

On the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc. hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. Weve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which weve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. 

Speaking of which, weve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. 

Including but not limited to night mode, user   post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)

[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you havent checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).

Last but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.

Other than that, I cant imagine we have much to talk about, but Ill hang to around some questions anyway.

subject4807 "
90," We hope so. r/science AMAs were one of the inspirations for this feature. The idea is you can create a landing page for an AMA days before the event to build up excitement, and then bring everybody back at the same time for the actual event. "
91, I can handle it.  
92, I believe the infra team is swamped with Official Business right now. Ill bring it up when they come up for air.  
93, u/subject4807 Ive come to bargain 
94," There are also a bunch of examples of users guessing wrong, which created all sorts of hilarious confusion.

The first version of text posts required the user to type self in the url field to create it automatically. 

These days, text posts make up about half Reddits submissions. Beyond subreddits and comments, it was probably the most significant feature we built.  "
95, Sigh... approved.  
96, Dang I was just writing a reply to this as well. Guess we got the same push notif.  
97, We investigate this community often but have not found it to be in violation of our content policy. We will reach out to the mods as needed about enforcing their own rules (specifically Rule 0: All posts must make an attempt at humor). 
98," Our accounts are 13 years old today, but I believe Reddit itself didn't launch for another two weeks or so. Thank you nevertheless! "
99," I was just about the tell the team about this one as well. Underlining markdown links would be nice. For some themes, the color choices make links in comments and posts basically invisible. "
100," The ads will change. While they will stay inline, we are going to try a few more versions. The trade off of course is that if they stand out too much, theyre distracting, if they are too subtle, theyre deceptive. Were trying to find the right balance.

I'll spare you our excuses for while we haven't been more responsive on this particular topic, but suffice to say we can do better on the communication, and I'll work on that as well. "
101, You mean QA-ing our product? 
102," Ive given that sort of feedback to newbies many times. If you put the code online somewhere or PM it to me, Id be happy to take a look.  "
103," I left a longer [explanation](https://new.reddit.com/r/science/comments/8khscc/rscience_will_no_longer_be_hosting_amas/dz8nky8/) in that thread, but the gist of it is r/science isn't a default anymore and their tactic of removing more popular posts to promote AMAs is not allowed.

The ""best"" sort should actually help communities like r/science get more visibility. That's the whole point. Though it's not really relevant right now since their AMA shenanigans predate any algorithm changes. "
104," The decision for r/science to no longer host AMAs is disappointing, and blaming us at Reddit is counterproductive.

u/nallen, having met you personally a number of times and after personally trying to work through this issue with you over the past months, I'm disappointed you've taken this approach to mislead your community about what's going on.

So here's what's really going on:

**How it used to work**

r/science used to be a default community, which means it was one of one hundred communities that made up the front page of Reddit for most of 20112016. As a result, r/science and the other defaults had high visibility at the expense of non\-default communities.

r/science used to promote AMAs by removing other more popular posts so that the AMA could be top of r/science without the votes. This, combined with being a default community, sent a lot of traffic to these AMAs.

**How it works today**

We replaced the defaults with r/popular, which is basically a SFW version of r/all. This puts all communities on an equal footing.

We don't allow the post manipulation for obvious reasons. Here is a [discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/77o0wm/friday_discussion_thread_what_unique_challenges/donto0j/?context=3) we had with u/nallen on this topic months ago.

We are indeed testing new sorting algorithms, but if anything they should help communities like r/science get more visibility. One of our engineers recently wrote a [pretty good post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/8kf5wm/reddits_first_pass_ranker/) about it.

**Going forward**

Regardless of u/nallen's decision, we will continue to work to improve our onboarding and sorting so that users get to see more of what they love, and we have in mind some specific features that will help promote ""event"" posts \(AMAs, game threads, episode threads\) in the future. "
105," You can use the old layout indefinitely. Go to [https://www.reddit.com/prefs/](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/) and uncheck ""use the redesign as my default experience."" I know the prefs page is a bit of a mess. It's one of the things we're rebuilding in the redesign. We have no plans to turn off old.reddit.com. 

As for why:

1. New tech stack. The existing codebase is nearly impossible to build in. The redesign gives us a modern platform in which to develop. In the redesign we're able to ship lots of stuff every week. [Here's our most recent update.](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8jgu1q/51518_release_notes_inbox_count_post_flair/)
2. Easier to use. r2, our name for the legacy site, is quite difficult to grok. We see and lose a lot of potential users every day because they don't know wtf Reddit is. Engagement in our native apps is 25x higher even though the content is identical. Part of this is due to the phone form factor, but part of this is do to a more visceral UI.
3. Adapt Reddit to its content. When r2 was built, Reddit was 100 #37; outbound links and self\-posts. Today, we have a lot more media and have plans to add more post types. The UI should support that.
4. Ads. In\-feed ads are what advertisers want to buy. Yes, they're in\-feed, which I know isn't popular, but it also means our top post is an organic post now instead of an ad. We will continue to iterate on the styling.
5. Perception. We will no longer have to explain our ancient UI to potential partners, which really was quite a hurdle. Reddit being synonymous with ""old and difficult to use"" isn't good for business.
6. Portable styles. I know there's a lot of heat around this one as well, but structured styles allow community styling to work across platforms, which is important given the majority of our traffic today is mobile. It also makes community styling easier and therefore more accessible to more communities.

We've still got a lot to do, but we started rolling it out because we decided it was good enough to get going, and if we waited until it was perfect, we'd never ship. Plus, having the user base providing constant ""feedback"" is highly motivating to the team.

Personally, I've switched my desktop Reddit\-ing to the redesign and am pretty happy. I'd encourage folks to give it a try. If you don't like it, opt\-out and hopefully check back in in a month. It's updating rapidly. "
106," It used to be the only way to ban. We still use it for spam, though Id like to phase it out long term. Today we have more tools, bans, timeouts, wrist slaps. Another problem with shadow bans is that it makes it difficult for others to audit our work: even if we ban something, theres little evidence we did.  "
107," If we knew everything everything we know today about spam, enforcement, and transparency, we probably wouldnt build shadow-banning. Its use is really limited to spam, and I think the downsides (false positives, lack of transparency) outweigh the benefits. 

That said, it was useful in the early days when spam was more of an arms race, we didnt have moderators or reporting, and our content policy was limited to spam.  "
108," Here's one of the [discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/7spgg0/best_is_the_new_hotness/) from when we first started rolling it out.

As for creating a feedback loop, Reddit is different from other sites in that your Home feed is comprised of communities to which you've explicitly subscribed, which makes that effect less likely to happen unless a user intentionally does it to themselves. That said, we do look at others online as cautionary tales. "
109," Votes, comments, and posts per user are up by 15 #37;. Time on site and retention is also improved. It's rare that just about every metric we care about goes up. This is presumably because users are seeing relevant posts.

Anecdotally, I see a lot more r/TheoryOfReddit posts, which I'm happy about. "
110," Yes. The ""Best"" sort on your home feed is the new version of the algorithm\(s\). We're constantly running tests here with the goal of surfacing content from your subscriptions that you're more likely to engage with. It also removes content you've already seen, which creates the appearance of much faster turnover.

The old algorithm, which was effectively a random selection of top posts from your subscriptions, is still accessible under ""Hot."" "
111," If youre not being sarcastic, Im looking forward to it!

But if you are being sarcastic, Im looking forward to it! "
112," We don't actually know. There are a handful of testing accounts that predate both of them, but we didn't store timestamps back then so all we know is that both were created on the same day. "
113," Lots. r/redesign is hot right now with the sports stuff, but we've received lots of positive sentiment over the months as we've progressed. Still a long way to go, but I think we're on the right track.

Speaking as one of the oldest Redditors and the creator of a lot of the current Reddit, I love the redesign. I have my gripes, of course \(performance, mostly\), but I know we'll get there. "
114," We've had thousands of testers over the past year of pretty much every variety: users, non\-users, in\-person, remote, prototypes, real code, quantitative, and qualitative. This in addition to the long\-running alpha with thousands of users for the past six months, and now the slow roll out to real users and optional opt\-in for many more.

Wired wrote a really good [piece](https://www.wired.com/story/reddit-redesign/) about the whole process, and we wrote a [couple](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7ul5k9/hey_were_here_to_talk_about_that_desktop_redesign/) [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/817lmi/til_reddit_has_a_design_team/) about it as well. "
115," Designated hitter: the least of baseball's problems. Find a way to shorten games by an hour.

Kickoffs: I love the idea of replacing them with 4th and 30 from your own 30. More exciting and safer.

1 and Done: stupid. "
116, I just want you to have the same experience I'm having. 
117," I'll take a lot of shit on this site, but this I cannot stand for. I think they should remove a player from each side every 3 minutes of overtime until there's nothing left but two goalies.

As it relates to the redesign, thanks for the feedback. I believe most of your concerns will be addressed (e.g. flair). Chat is super early, that's why we're testing. And the wiki and automod work just fine. Not sure where that rumor started. "
118," No. That's nonsense.

Do you have a bot or something that replies with this to everything I write? If so, turn it off. "
119, Should be fixed now. Will dig in and see what happened. I think there was a miscommunication of what the problem actually was. 
120," The funny thing is I'm not actually a prepper. It's true, I do own a couple guns, have had eye surgery, and am into motorcycles, and it's true those things would come in handy if society collapsed, but really what happened with that article is I thought I was talking on background about people I know who are actually preppers and gave a bunch of colorful (and cringey) quotes, which is an unfortunate habit I have.

In reality, the only thing I'm qualified to shoot are empty Bud Light cans; I wanted to be able to see the toilet at night when I pee; and, motorcycles are cool. "
121,  
122," Yes. Since we banned CT in 2015, weve updated our policies against harassment, bullying, and violence, all of which would be grounds for dismissal for that community.

Furthermore, the teams who make and enforce these decisions are much more robust. 

CT was frustrating as the time because we didnt have the policies and processes in place, but they wouldnt last long today.  "
123," It's not clear from the banned users pages, but mods banned more than half of the users and a majority of the posts before they got any traction at all. That was heartening to see. Thank you for all that you and your mod cabal do for Reddit. "
124, Thank you for restoring balance. 
125," Ah, thanks. Glad we got a chance to catch up in person too! "
126," The same techniques we use looking backwards, we will continue to use into the future. Preventing the manipulation of Reddit, political or otherwise, has always been a priority for us, and we'll continue to invest here.

One thing to note is that the majority of users in this list and their posts were caught and banned by moderators, so improving tools for community moderation will also be an ongoing investment. "
127, Haven't heard that in a while. Thank you. The haters must be hating elsewhere today. 
128," Truth.

Also, buy Gold. "
129, Cheers! 
130," Believe me, this annoys me to no end. We're releasing a lot of product changes, and not all of them are optimized (I'll take the good with the bad). We do have a couple people specifically tackling perf right now. "
131," I'm doing well, thanks for asking.

I've actually been quite frustrated the past few months not being able to share what we've found re Russia, and I'm glad we had the opportunity to do so today. "
132, That's a hard question. Let me have my team follow up with you. 
133," **Update (4/12):** In the heat of a live AMA, I dont always find the right words to express what I mean.  I decided to answer this direct question knowing it would be a difficult one because it comes up on Reddit quite a bit. Id like to add more nuance to my answer:

While the words and expressions you refer to arent explicitly forbidden, the behaviors they often lead to are. 

To be perfectly clear, while racism itself isnt against the rules, its not welcome here. I try to stay neutral on most political topics, but this isnt one of them.

I believe the best defense against racism and other repugnant views, both on Reddit and in the world, is instead of trying to control what people can and cannot say through rules, is to repudiate these views in a free conversation, and empower our communities to do so on Reddit.

When it comes to enforcement, we separate behavior from beliefs. We cannot control peoples beliefs, but we can police their behaviors. As it happens, communities dedicated racist beliefs end up banned for violating rules we do have around harassment, bullying, and violence.

There exist repugnant views in the world. As a result, these views may also exist on Reddit. I dont want them to exist on Reddit any more than I want them to exist in the world, but I believe that presenting a sanitized view of humanity does us all a disservice. Its up to all of us to reject these views.

These are complicated issues, and we may not always agree, but I am listening to your responses, and I do appreciate your perspectives. Our policies have changed a lot over the years, and will continue to evolve into the future. Thank you.

**Original response:**

It's not. On Reddit, the way in which we think about speech is to separate behavior from beliefs. This means on Reddit there will be people with beliefs different from your own, sometimes extremely so. When users actions conflict with our content policies, we take action.

Our approach to governance is that communities can set appropriate standards around language for themselves. Many communities have rules around speech that are more restrictive than our own, and we fully support those rules. "
134," I often talk about how Reddit has taught me that when put in the right context, people are more funny, interesting, collaborative, and helpful than we give them credit for. Look at all the wonderful things people do for one another through Reddit.

CircleOfTrust taught me that I was wrong. "
135, The funny thing is these accounts had the same trouble onboarding into Reddit as regular new users do... 
136, Thank you! 
137," You are more than welcome to bring suspicious accounts to my attention directly, or report them to r/reddit.com.

We do ask that you do not post them publicly: we have seen public false positives lead to harassment. "
138," That community is on our radar for a variety of reasons, and we're investigating. "
139," 943: Save 1 point for my mother, who I think would enjoy watching.

In all seriousness, we feel somewhat vindicated. We have avoided collecting personal information since the beginningsometimes to the detriment of our businessand will continue to do so going forward. "
140," The accounts we released today are the ones we confirmed as suspicious, but we continue to look for more.

We review r/the_donald frequently. We don't believe they are presently breaking our [site-wide rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/). That does not mean we endorse their views, however. In many cases their views and values conflict with my own, but allowing other views to exist is what lends authenticity to all of Reddit.

I understand many of you do not agree with me, but I believe it's critical that we are disciplined when enforcing our content policies. "
141," We didn't see any political ads from Russia during the election. Nevertheless, we no longer accept advertising from Russia at all.

With regard to ads transparency, I think we can do more here, yes. "
142, u/KeyserSosa please investigate 
143," On the contrary, user privacy has been paramount since our founding. From the beginning and through to this day we've not collected PII (Personally Identifying Information). We don't know your name, address, age, race, gender, and we don't want to know, and we'll never force you to share it to use Reddit. We only store the IP addresses you use to access Reddit for 100 days.

We do this for a couple of reasons:

* We don't want the burden of storing this information
* We don't want to risk compromising it
* What makes Reddit special is that people can be themselves. We believe disconnecting from your real world identity makes this possible.
* We want to minimize the surface area against which we can be subpoenaed

We haven't made any significant changes to our tracking in the last year beyond updating our endpoints to avoid site-breaking changes by ad-blockers (though not to block ad-blockers themselves).

We do track your clicks. We do this so we can better rank which subreddits you see in your home feed. You can opt out at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/. Furthermore, you can opt out of other advertising related tracking at https://www.reddit.com/personalization/. "
144," There were a number of signals: suspicious creation patterns, usage patterns (account sharing), voting collaboration, etc. We also corroborated our findings with public lists from other companies (e.g. Twitter). "
145," The old backend was officially retired this week! The new backend is much faster and more reliable, and a little bit more accurate. The next step is to continue to tune and improve the relevancy. "
146," Thanks for the gold, kind stranger "
147," There were about 14k posts in total by all of these users. The top ten communities by posts were:

* funny: 1455
* uncen: 1443
* Bad_Cop_No_Donut: 800
* gifs: 553
* PoliticalHumor: 545
* The_Donald: 316
* news: 306
* aww: 290
* POLITIC: 232
* racism: 214

We left the accounts up so you may dig in yourselves. "
148," Hi all,

Each year around this time, we share Reddits latest transparency report and a few highlights from our Legal teams efforts to protect user privacy. This year, our annual post happens to coincide with one of the biggest national discussions of privacy online and the integrity of the platforms we use, so I wanted to share a more in\-depth update in an effort to be as transparent with you all as possible.

First, here is our [2017 Transparency Report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report). This details government and law\-enforcement requests for private information about our users. The types of requests we receive most often are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all of these requests to be legally valid, and we push back against those we dont consider legally justified. In 2017, we received significantly more requests to produce or preserve user account information. The percentage of requests we deemed to be legally valid, however, [decreased slightly for both types of requests](https://i.redditmedia.com/pFVOHUupWLqk_MRNKJVgGzuKhSXkN4j0xym2LCdlnrU.png?fit=crop crop=faces%2Centropy arh=2 w=960 s=28bc738a240d9a7b240e6c54e7955eb3). \(Youll find a full breakdown of these stats, as well as non\-governmental requests and DMCA takedown notices, in the report. You can find our transparency reports from previous years [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).\) 

We also participated in a number of amicus briefs, joining other tech companies in support of issues we care about. In Hassell v. Bird and Yelp v. Superior Court \(Montagna\), we argued for the right to defend a user's speech and anonymity if the user is sued. And this year, we've advocated for upholding the net neutrality rules \(County of Santa Clara v. FCC\) and defending user anonymity against unmasking prior to a lawsuit \(Glassdoor v. Andra Group, LP\).

Id also like to give an update to my last post about the [investigation into Russian attempts to exploit Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/827zqc/in_response_to_recent_reports_about_the_integrity/). Ive mentioned before that were cooperating with Congressional inquiries. In the spirit of transparency, were going to share with you what we shared with them earlier today:

In my post last month, I described that we had found and removed a few hundred accounts that were of suspected Russian Internet Research Agency origin. Id like to share with you more fully what that means. At this point in our investigation, we have found 944 suspicious accounts, few of which had a visible impact on the site: 

* 70 #37; \(662\) had zero karma
* 1 #37; \(8\) had negative karma
* 22 #37; \(203\) had 1\-999 karma
* 6 #37; \(58\) had 1,000\-9,999 karma
* 1 #37; \(13\) had a karma score of 10,000\+

Of the 282 accounts with non\-zero karma, more than half \(145\) were banned prior to the start of this investigation through our routine Trust   Safety practices. All of these bans took place before the 2016 election and in fact, all but 8 of them took place back in 2015. This general pattern also held for the accounts with significant karma: of the 13 accounts with 10,000\+ karma, 6 had already been banned prior to our investigationall of them before the 2016 election. Ultimately, we have seven accounts with significant karma scores that made it past our defenses.

And as I mentioned last time, our investigation did not find any election\-related advertisements of the nature found on other platforms, through either our self\-serve or managed advertisements. I also want to be very clear that none of the 944 users placed any ads on Reddit. We also did not detect any effective use of these accounts to engage in vote manipulation. 

To give you more insight into our findings, [here is a link to all 944 accounts](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/suspiciousaccounts). We have decided to keep them visible for now, but after a period of time the accounts and their content will be removed from Reddit. We are doing this to allow moderators, investigators, and all of you to see their account histories for yourselves.

We still have a lot of room to improve, and we intend to remain vigilant. Over the past several months, our teams have evaluated our site\-wide protections against fraud and abuse to see where we can make those improvements. But I am pleased to say that these investigations have shown that the efforts of our Trust   Safety and Anti\-Evil teams are working. Its also a tremendous testament to the work of our moderators and the healthy skepticism of our communities, which make Reddit a difficult platform to manipulate.

We know the success of Reddit is dependent on [your trust](https://www.reddit.com/r/CircleofTrust/comments/89slln/lets_see_if_you_can_hold_off_betraying_long/). We hope continue to build on that by communicating openly with you about these subjects, now and in the future. Thanks for reading. Ill stick around for a bit to answer questions.

update: I'm off for now. Thanks for the questions! "
149," The pw is my most commonly received PM.

update: Lame! To the betrayer, I returned the favor.

proof: https://i.redd.it/rv1xlcnlayp01.png "
150,  
151," If anyone's interested, I found a hard drive in my garage with the [original Reddit Lisp code](https://github.com/reddit/reddit1.0/) from 2005. Been looking for it for years. Enjoy. "
152, There it is.  
153," Allow me to assist... the trolls should be here any minute. 

(And, Hi! It was a pleasure getting to know you and your team. Im still working up the courage the read the piece myself.) "
154," I didn't succeed in making it much shorter, either. "
155," This post is really the first time we've said anything of consequence regarding Russia, and we wanted to share it with you, the community, first.

 A lot of words were used, but very little was said.

Let me try again, with at least fewer words, but hopefully a little more clearly as well.

1. In regards to ads, we haven't seen much on Reddit. It's been an issue elsewhere online, but not a factor on Reddit. We'll stay vigilant going forward.

2. As it relates to actual Russia accounts on Reddit. We have found a few hundred accounts through a variety of means. The vast majority of these accounts were rejected by our communities back in 20152016 before Russia was even a topic of conversation. Our spam filters, community rules against self-promotion, and moderators banned nearly all of them. I don't want to give the impression the work stops there. That's what we've seen so far, and we're still looking deeply.

3. As for propaganda (Russian or otherwise, and there was plenty of American propaganda to go around) hosted elsewhere that was amplified by real organic users, weve seen a lot of that, both on Reddit and elsewhere. Reddit is a huge place with thousands of communities and opinions. That's both what makes us special and what creates conflict. That's not to say there isn't plenty of work for us: we will continue to invest in better tooling, both for our internal teams and for moderators; we'll continue to ensure our voting systems aren't being manipulated; and we'll continue grow our teams so we can enforce our policies at scale.
 "
156," I'm sorry that's your experience. That's certainly not our intention. The ads are monitored, and if you're having a different experience, please report them to me. 

Update: I can't speak for third-party apps who run their own ads, which I think is relevant to you. "
157," Point taken. Didn't mean to mislead. I was referring to ads bought directly on Reddit either through our sales team or ads.reddit.com.

We do also run programmatic ads that are bought through ad networks that include Reddit. These don't go through the same approval process, but they're also not specific to Reddit. We have had occasional problems in the past where an ad with sound or video sneaks through, usually when an ad is misclassified as non-video. These issues are uncommon, and we've basically eliminated them in the last year. "
158," We dont take banning subs lightly. Each sub is reviewed by a humanand in some cases, a team of humansbefore it is banned for a content policy violation. In cases where a subs sole purpose is in direct violation of our policies (i.e. sharing of involuntary porn), we will ban a sub outright. But generally before banning, we attempt to work with the mods to clarify our expectations and policies regarding what content is welcome.

Communities do evolve over time, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively, so we do need to re-review communities from time to time, which is what's going on in this case. Revenue isn't a factor. "
159,"  So I see you are carrying on the Reddit Tradition of only taking action after the media notices a problem. Is there any chance this will change in the future?

As I mentioned in the post, we've been taking action for a long time. We have been cagey about it publicly I know, which frustrates us as well, but it's an active investigation, and it's difficult to share specifics without undermining it.

I know this isn't a satisfying answer, but I promise you this is something we are deeply focused on.

 "
160," We are aware, and this community is under review.

More context: the original creator of the sub nuked it about two months ago and deleted all the content. Its now back up and running, which is why were getting new reports. "
161," These are the important questions we should be asking, both on Reddit and more broadly in America.

On Reddit, we see our users and communities taking action, whether it's moderators banning domains or users downvoting posts and comments. During the same time periods mentioned in this [Buzzfeed analysis](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/viral-fake-election-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook), engagement of biased news sources on Reddit dropped 58% and engagement of fake news sources (as defined at the domain level by Buzzfeed) dropped 56%. Trustworthy new sources on Reddit receive 5x the engagement of biased sources and 100x the engagement of fake news sources.

The biggest factor in fighting back is awareness, and one of the silver linings of this ordeal is that awareness is higher than ever.

We still have a long way to go, but I believe we are making progress. "
162," A few months ago, we expanded our [policy around violent speech](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/). Since then, we have removed dozens of communities and actioned thousands of users. When you see violent content, please report it to us. "
163," Banning them probably won't accomplish what you want. However, letting them fall apart from [their own dysfunction probably will](https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/811gsu/rthe_donald_is_imploding_following_trumps_progun/). Their engagement is shrinking over time, and that's much more powerful than shutting them down outright. "
164," In the past couple of weeks, Reddit has been mentioned as one of the platforms used to promote Russian propaganda. As its an ongoing investigation, we have been relatively quiet on the topic publicly, which I know can be frustrating. While transparency is important, we also want to be careful to not tip our hand too much while we are investigating. We take the integrity of Reddit extremely seriously, both as the stewards of the site and as Americans.

Given the recent news, wed like to share some of what weve learned:

When it comes to Russian influence on Reddit, there are three broad areas to discuss: ads, direct propaganda from Russians, indirect propaganda promoted by our users.

On the first topic, ads, there is not much to share. We dont see a lot of ads from Russia, either before or after the 2016 election, and what we do see are mostly ads promoting spam and ICOs.  Presently, ads from Russia are blocked entirely, and all ads on Reddit are reviewed by humans. Moreover, our [ad policies](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/advertising/policy-and-guidelines/reddit-advertising-policy) prohibit content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural views.

As for direct propaganda, that is, content from accounts we suspect are of Russian origin or content linking directly to known propaganda domains, we are doing our best to identify and remove it. We have found and removed a few hundred accounts, and of course, every account we find expands our search a little more. The vast majority of suspicious accounts we have found in the past months were banned back in 20152016 through our enhanced efforts to prevent abuse of the site generally.

The final case, indirect propaganda, is the most complex. For example, the Twitter account @TEN\_GOP is now known to be a Russian agent. @TEN\_GOPs Tweets were amplified by thousands of Reddit users, and sadly, from everything we can tell, these users are mostly American, and appear to be unwittingly promoting Russian propaganda. I believe the biggest risk we face as Americans is our own ability to discern reality from nonsense, and this is a burden we all bear.

I wish there was a solution as simple as banning all propaganda, but its not that easy. Between truth and fiction are a thousand shades of grey. Its up to all of usRedditors, citizens, journaliststo work through these issues. Its somewhat ironic, but I actually believe what were going through right now will actually reinvigorate Americans to be more vigilant, hold ourselves to higher standards of discourse, and fight back against propaganda, whether foreign or not.

Thank you for reading. While I know its frustrating that we dont share everything we know publicly, I want to reiterate that we take these matters very seriously, and we are cooperating with congressional inquiries. We are growing more sophisticated by the day, and we remain open to suggestions and feedback for how we can improve. "
165," Matrix is my cousin. Thats the name he used to use all over.

pg is Paul Graham, our first investor. Bugbear and connman were buddies. 

I dont remember who meegan was. 

Update: matrix forgot his password. Ill fix when I get home, and he can explain for himself... "
166, Thank you for fighting! Net Neutrality is something we strongly believe in at Reddit. 
167, Don't sell yourself short! 
168," The goal for ticket response time is 24h, which is reasonable given the load. We maintained that for most of the year, but slipped in Q4 to a median response time of 35h because we've spent more time on proactive support to prevent major issues. We're reorganizing the team to have folks dedicated full time to support tickets and hiring more to stay on top of our numbers.

I'm sorry we slipped, but please don't assume it's because we don't care. "
169, No need to apologize. I'm sorry for your loss. 
170," I asked, but he doesn't want to talk about the hard issues like new profile pages. "
171," Generally the mods of pics have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of pics that refuse to work with us.

At Reddit, we try to separate behavior from beliefs. People are free to have whatever beliefs they want, but we do care about your behavior, specifically whether or not you are violating our content policy.

During the election, I defended that community because they represented a frustration in the US that a large part of the population needs random pictures about nothing.

We are on the eve of the Presidents SOTU and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and were more divided than ever. I dont believe banning a community that represents no viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse. Its much more powerful for the greater population to reject these views than for us to ban them and turn them into martyrs. "
172," Nearly all of those posts were banned by mods, and we watch that list ourselves to be sure. "
173," Reddit is more communal and has more shared spaces than our peers, which means both that Reddit is better insulated from these sorts of attacks (moderators, downvotes, community acceptance), and it also means we've felt it our duty from the beginning to protect our communities from this sort of abuse.

Cheaters do succeed from time to time, but we take this sort abuse extremely seriously, and are constantly getting better at fighting it. "
174," We'd really like to, tbh, but there are major privacy concerns with exposing that sort of information. "
175, Agreed. I think I responded to this elsewhere: we are going to take a another pass at this. 
176, Deal. 
177," Just a joke knowing today was going to be a tough one. I can't go anywhere, no one else wants this job! Fortunately, I love it. "
178, Nearly every one of those posts has been banned by mods. We actually watch this list ourselves to make sure. 
179, There aren't any fake delays. 
180," We can't fix things if we don't break them first!

But seriously, I know it's annoying. We're going to redo all that. "
181, It's HQF. Sometimes you just want to laugh at something that isn't funny. 
182," Yep, you can view them now, and creation is on the roadmap. "
183," All of those things, yes, with a particular focus on PM harassment last year. This year our focus will be reducing the amount of noise in our reporting system so that the reports moderators and we see will be much more useful. "
184," They're the engineering team that focuses on internal tools and abuse at scale: spam, account take-overs (they just release 2FA!), vote manipulation, etc. It's the team I'd love to be on if I was still engineering. "
185," Thank you. We know we have a long way to go, but I'm proud of how far we and the team have come.

Taking flak is part of the gig. Doesn't always feel good, but the passion of our users in every direction is what makes this place special. "
186," Moderators shouldn't have to deal with sockpuppets and brigading, but we do take abuse of Reddit seriously, and spend a fair amount of time working on it. Our VP Product gave a [long answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/7sn6b0/regarding_crossposts/dt6bhm9/?context=0) on this topic earlier this week.

The tl;dr is we're adopting more sophisticated approaches to brigading and manipulation.

 "
187," Yes! April Fools is in the works, Robin is gone but not forgotten (we've got a lot of fun chat things coming), and a bunch of IRL events. "
188," We've been in testing the past few months with a few thousand users and moderators, and the feedback has been super valuable. Every week we survey the testers and invite more users. We'll expanding the beta to many more users over the next month. Subscribe to r/beta to get involved.

As I mentioned in my post, in addition to bringing in more users to test, we'll be doing a series of blog posts and videos to explain what we're doing and what we're trying to accomplish.

Speaking as a Reddit user, I've been using the new site nearly exclusively the past couple of weeks, and am pretty happy. We're not there yet, but Reddit is as addictive as ever. I even had to re-block it on the my laptop during working hours. "
189," Here's how I see things going: we'll do our very best to get the redesign out. This is a massive effort, involves much of our team, and thousands of user testers (increasing to hundreds of thousands over the next month). The redesign will include another pass at profile pages. We don't have plans to shut off the legacy site, though it may run under a different domain. We'll leave old profile pages there.

Most of the feedback we've received on the new profiles are very addressable, so I'm confident we'll get it to a place most users like, but we'll have the old site just in case.

update: No this wasn't the plan from the beginning, but we also didn't plan on diverting resources to finish up the redesign. We still have a vision for profiles that we believe we be really good for the site, but we're not there yet. We hear your frustration, and will do our best to work out of the situation. "
190, Acknowledged. Thank you. 
191," Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

At Reddit, we try to separate behavior from beliefs. People are free to have whatever beliefs they want, but we do care about your behavior, specifically whether or not you are violating our content policy.

During the election, I defended that community because they represented a frustration in the US that a large part of the population felt left out, left behind, and unheard by the system.

We are on the eve of the Presidents SOTU and, sadly, alienation and cynicism are still deeply felt by much of our population, and were more divided than ever. I dont believe banning a community that represents different viewpoints does anything but make the problem worse. Its much more powerful for the greater population to reject these views than for us to ban them and turn them into martyrs. "
192, Thank you! 
193," Not quite. Orwellian would be ""Trust   Safety"". Wait. Shit. "
194," Yes, we're adding an option for the legacy profiles while we finish the new ones.

The team is all hands on deck finishing the redesign, which means we've slowed on the new profiles. Our plan is to pause the rollout, give an option to use the legacy version, and finish the profiles with the redesign, taking into account the feedback we've received so far.

 "
195," We still have a long way to go, but we [are making progress] (https://redditblog.com/2017/09/07/the-search-for-better-search-at-reddit/) on search. "
196," Hello again,

Now that its far enough into the year that were all [writing the date correctly](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7npj23/first_day_back_in_this_office_this_year_i_never/), I thought Id give a quick recap of 2017 and share some of what were working on in 2018.

In 2017, we doubled the size of our staff, and as a result, we accomplished more than ever:

We recently gave our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage hl=en) apps major updates that, in addition to many of your most\-requested features, also includes a new suite of mod tools. If you havent tried the app in a while, please check it out! 

We added a ton of new features to Reddit, from spoiler tags and post\-to\-profile to chat \(now in beta for individuals and groups\), and were especially pleased to see features that didnt exist a year ago like crossposts and native video on our front pages every day.

Not every launch has gone swimmingly, and while we may not respond to everything directly, we do see and read all of your feedback. We rarely get things right the first time \(profile pages, anybody?\), but were still working on these features and well do our best to continue improving Reddit for everybody. If youd like to participate and follow along with every change, subscribe to r/announcements \(major announcements\), r/beta \(long\-running tests\), r/modnews \(moderator features\), and r/changelog \(most everything else\).

Im particularly proud of how far our Community, Trust   Safety, and Anti\-Evil teams have come. Weve steadily shifted the balance of our work from reactive to proactive, which means that much more often were catching issues before they become issues. Id like to highlight one stat in particular: at the beginning of 2017 our T S work was almost entirely driven by user reports. Today, more than half of the users and content we action are caught by us proactively using more sophisticated modeling. Often we catch policy violations before being reported or even seen by users or mods.

The greater Reddit community does something incredible every day. In fact, one of the lessons Ive learned from Reddit is that when people are in the right context, they are more creative, collaborative, supportive, and funnier than we sometimes give ourselves credit for \(Im serious!\). A couple great examples from last year include that time you all created an [artistic masterpiece](https://redditblog.com/2017/04/18/place-part-two/) and that other time you all organized [site\-wide grassroots campaigns](https://redditblog.com/2017/12/11/an-analysis-of-net-neutrality-activism-on-reddit/) for net neutrality. Well done, everybody.

In 2018, well continue our efforts to make Reddit welcoming. Our biggest project continues to be the web redesign. We know you have a lot of questions, so our teams will be doing a series of blog posts and AMAs all about the redesign, starting soon\-ish in r/blog. 

Its still in alpha with a few thousand users testing it every day, but were excited about the progress weve made and looking forward to expanding our testing group to more users. \(Thanks to all of you who have offered your feedback so far!\) If youd like to join in the fun, we pull testers from r/beta. Well be dramatically increasing the number of testers soon.

Were super excited about 2018. The staff and I will hang around to answer questions for a bit.

Happy New Year,

Steve and the Reddit team

update: I'm off for now. As always, thanks for the feedback and questions. "
197, Nope.  
198, No. We dont negotiate with terrorists.  
199, good bot 
200," Following todays disappointing vote from the FCC, Alexis and I wanted to take the time to thank redditors for your incredible activism on this issue, and reassure you that were going to continue fighting for the free and open internet. 

Over the past few months, we have been floored by the energy and creativity redditors have displayed in the effort to save net neutrality. It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \(twice\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.

It is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCCs own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). 

Nevertheless, todays vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.

Many of you have asked what comes next. We dont exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCCs decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. Its also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that arent subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.

What is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. 

This isnt the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness youve created. Those who thought that theyd be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. Well keep you informed as things develop.

u\/arabscarab \(Jessica, our head of policy\) will also be in the comments to address your questions. 

u\/subject4807   u\/kn0thing

update: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Clyburn and Rosenworcel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality).

update2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements. However, the actual vote appears to be delayed for security reasons. We hope everyone is safe.

update3 (10:13AM pst): The FCC votes to repeal 32. "
201," ~~Not strictly opposed to it, but I do want to make sure we are spending our and your energy where it will be most effective. I don't think we can affect the FCC's vote in Dec because it's clear they're disregarding the views of the public.~~

Depending on what happens afterwards, whether it's a court challenge or legislation, we'll coordinate our next moves with the community.

update: Actually, we're going to put something up. "
202, We did exactly that back in July when the FCC requested comments. 
203," We've considered that but decided ultimately decided against it. People depend on Reddit, and we felt it would be irresponsible to take it offline, even for a protest as important is this one.

Additionally, the community takeover on Thanksgiving was likely more effective than a blackout. It drove a ton of traffic, started many conversations, and picked up lots of press, all of which would be the goal of a blackout. "
204," It's hard to say exactly, and that's part of the problem.

Most Americans have little or no choice of ISPs, and as it happens, the largest ISPs in the US are also some of the largest media companies.

For consumers, this means the ISP you are practically forced to use also can control what media you have access to.

For business, this means you are at the mercy of the ISPs, who as media companies are also likely competitors, to reach your customer. Bandwidth intensive, yet worldly important companies like Netflix and YouTube would have a really hard time getting off the ground if they existed at the whims of the major ISPs/media companies. "
205," **Update**: Thank you, everyone! We were in touch with Congressman Mike Doyle's office yesterday sharing some of your great stories from his home district in Pennsylvania (thanks, u/Bones_MD!), and they've heard you loud and clear. They are leading an effort to get Congress to ask the FCC to delay their December 14 vote, but they need as many Congressional members as possible to sign on. You can help them by calling or writing your member of Congress (look them up [here](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep) or through [www.battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)) and specifically asking him or her to sign onto Representative Doyle's letter to the FCC. We'll be doing the same. Keep it up, we're being heard!

*****

Hi All,

If you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap whats happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.

On Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. Youve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. 

In just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesdays news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.

As many of you know, the FCCs vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutralitys giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans dont see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.

Most of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that dont introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCCs decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcels suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to make a ruckus to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  

A few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, were asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. 

We will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to  if it comes to it  the Supreme Court. 

So, please tell us in the comments:

*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* 

Include as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.

Thank you.

u/ArabScarab \(Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy\), and I will hang around to answer questions. "
206," Submit-time validation is high on our list. That'll mean users get errors immediately instead of being surprised later. Should help, I think. "
207," Yes. I forgot to turn Post Replies off today.

Honestly, there have been times over the years, but they are few and far between. Yes, it can be intense and stressful at times, but we are very proud of Reddit and the positive impact it has on people's lives. I know it's not perfect, but we improve every day. I feel so fortunate to have the opportunity to make a difference, not everybody gets this opportunity, and I think we have a moral obligation to make the most of it. "
208," You have a plugin installed that changes the display, probably changed the sort, scrolled down to the middle of the page, and then took a screenshot.

We're totally open to feedback, but I don't think you're approaching this fairly. "
209," Wasn't a fan as a kid, but I am now. Tastes change. "
210," It's not 50, but there is a limit. I think it's 100 now but increasing to a few hundred in a couple weeks.

Even better, we're testing an entirely new algorithm that doesn't have this limitation and shows you more from smaller communities you frequent. "
211," First answer: the average age of a post on Reddit's page is dramatically lower now than it was 3-4 years ago (a couple hours vs close to 20). I think people's expectations are higher.

Second answer: the mobile app is much more aggressive about content turnover. We have a test running where every time you open the app you see new content.

The web behavior lags because we're in the middle of rebuilding it, but it'll speed up as well. "
212," Yes, actually. "
213," i know, right? "
214," It's actively improving! We have an entirely new system. Uptime is dramatically better (80s to the 99.9%), and relevancy is improved. We're continuing to refine it. I believe there are a small percentage of users still on the old system so we can measure the improvement, and if this includes you, I'm really really sorry. "
215, Why buy the cow when you get the milk for free? 
216, Lord knows I'm trying. 
217," Yep. Proper mod tools for mobile are in development now. They'll ship in the next major (4.0) release, which we expect this year. "
218," The original vision for Reddit was quite small. We wanted to build a place where people could find new and interesting things online. Specifically, we wanted the site to have the community feel of Slashdot but with content curated by users.

As Reddit has grown, so has our vision. Reddit provides human connection and belonging, for which we believe people have a fundamental need. People come to Reddit to stay informed, to laugh, to learn, to argue, for support, to talk about freaky sex stuff... Reddit means a lot of things to a lot of people, and we want to provide our service for everyone on the planet.

Of course, the increase in size means we attract people who want to exploit us. We at Reddit Inc will do our best to prevent this, and the greater Reddit community will fight it as well.

Reddit is the most human place on the Internet, we'll fight to preserve this as hard as we can. "
219, We've hired a bunch of CM's and are hiring more. Job descriptions aren't 1:1 with hires. 
220," I would love to be completely transparent about what we're doing here, but given the sensitive nature of the situation, I have to be vague. My apologies.

Independent of any scrutiny, we take both the integrity of Reddit and the US elections extremely seriously.

We're digging deeply. Chris (u/keysersosa, CTO) and I are personally leading the effort. When we have something to share, we will. "
221," Ah, well let me share another perspective.

A really important target user of this feature is the original content creator. Back in the beginning, we created the 1-in-10 rule, which meant that you were only allowed to submit 1-in-10 pieces of content from the same domain. This was in response to folks who would show up on Reddit, not know their way around, and submit every piece of content from their blog. We only had one community then, and this behavior was considered rude at best, and spam at worst. Keep in mind we had only links back then as well.

Skip ahead to today, we have many thousands of communities, proper spam prevention, and a massive userbase to curate good content. More than 60% of the content on Reddit exists in self posts. The users who create original, unique, relevant content off-site would be huge on Reddit if their content was in text posts hosted on Reddit instead. The only difference is in hosting. Profile pages are intended to be hosting for these users.

I was talking to a friend the other night who writes a blog dedicated to news for our neighborhood. It's great content, it would be right at home in a couple of places on Reddit. She is a writer, not a social media expert. I think it's unfair that in addition to creating good content we expect her to source nine other things from around the web so her stuff will be seen by the audience that will probably like it (I'm speaking on behalf of these communities. I'm a part of them). With new profile pages, she can submit her stuff to her profile, and if the relevant communities like it, they can crosspost it in. If they don't, she can build her own following on her profile. The end result is the can write and post without being treated like a spammer.

Hope this gives a little more context to what we're trying to build. "
222," The old pages are still accessible. Whether we build an opt-out or leave it as a link depends on the feedback we receive. One of the reasons we do these posts is to gauge sentiment around upcoming changes.

That said, presently less than 1% of logged-in users switch to the old pages or use a plugin. "
223," Reddit Inc looks for bots and other forms of manipulation. Whether around politics, advertising, or general cheating, we spend quite a bit of time on this, and have since pretty much the beginning. Everyone once and a while someone gets the best of us, but we continually improve, and it's rare they succeed twice.

Reddit itself is more resilient than other places online because our community is generally pretty good at sniffing out bullshit, and structure of our site means any one viewpoint isn't seen and accepted by everyone.

People have this notion that something is either misinformation or not, but the reality is there is a lot of space between misinformation, satire, people just being wrong, trolling, and biased reporting.

That said, our largest news communities strictly enforce specific rules about which sources are considered valid. "
224," You're right, adding more mod permissions is an easy improvement. We have a ""moderators"" dev team now. At the moment they're working on an enhanced mod queue, subreddit styling, and a new flair system. "
225," We have a more clear content policy than we've had in the past, we've staffed our team to handle more load, and we have internal processes to speed decision making.

The result is that we are in fact getting to toxic communities far quicker than we have in the past. This is evidenced by the size of communities themselves. In 2015/16, these communities were often 50k+ subscribers. In the most recent wave, the largest community was about 7k. "
226," Short answer, yes.

Long answer, we created moderator guidelines outlawing the practice, but we also understand the context in which these ban bots were created. We're working with those communities, enhancing mod tools, and planning more transparency for bans so we can get there in time. "
227," I'm not sure off the top of my head if there is a performance reason or if it's arbitrary. I can follow up, and if it's the latter, it's an easy change. "
228," Sounds like a bug. The team will investigate and get back to you.

HEY TEAM, INVESTIGATE AND GET BACK TO THIS USER! "
229, It's also built into RES! 
230, You must have me confused with [someone else](https://www.reddit.com/r/zuckmemes/). 
231," Yes! It's in active development. The redesign includes rich text editing for posts, comments, and messages, as well as an overhaul of the inbox entirely. "
232," I don't have the exact numbers, but yes, r/popular increased engagement from new users, which was the goal. "
233," 1. Great question. Subreddit governance is a huge challenge. We've not tackled it directly to date because there has been so much foundational work to get out of the way first (e.g. moderator guidelines, real mod tools, fully developed community team). We're getting closer.

2. We are still a small company, fewer than 300 people. We're actively hiring for weekend coverage right now, so hopefully the next time we chat we have this problem solved. "
234, Permission granted. 
235," I'm not sure the forum in which you're not getting responses. If you clarify, I will follow up with the team. However I can assure you we are receiving great feedback and even if you don't get a direct response from us, we are making a ton of improvements based on what we're hearing from testers.

There are a variety of goals, but chief among them is decreasing the bounce rate of first-time visitors and increasing time on site for everyone.

More generally, Reddit grows primarily through word of mouth. Many of us evangelize Reddit and tell people how awesome it is, what an impact it's made in their life, how much it makes them laugh, etc, and then when those new people decide to check out Reddit for the first time they're greeted with dystopian Craigslist. We'd like to fix that. "
236," We're taking another pass at r/popular, Reddit's default listing, as we speak, and I expect their remove.

r/all will remain unfiltered, but it's opt-in.

edit: you added a second question after I answered. See my [response re the_donald](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/7a4bjo/time_for_my_quarterly_inquisition_reddit_ceo_here/dp708xx/). "
237," Many of these links are probably in violation of our policy, but most are unreported, which is what alerts the mods and our team, especially when there are few votes. We'll consider them reported now.

Generally the mods of the_donald have been cooperative when we approach them with systematic abuses. Typically we ban entire communities only when the mods are uncooperative or the entire premise of the community is in violation of our policies. In the past we have removed mods of the_donald that refuse to work with us.

Finally, the_donald is a small part of a large problem we face in this countrythat a large part of the population feels unheard, and the last thing we're going to do is take their voice away.


 "
238," There were two main reasons. The first is that we take our time on policy changes. We want to be thoughtful about the policy itself, which takes time, and the policy roll-out was done in conjunction with mass enforcement actions, which also take time to plan and coordinate.

The second reason is that we waited until we had more staff on our Trust and Safety team so we guarantee coverage.

Finally, in the wake of Charlottesville, which was my home for five years, I was quite emotional, and it took time to think clearly about what we were going to do. "
239," 2FA is opt-in, though we highly encourage it for high-value accounts (e.g. moderators of large subreddits).

The new profile pages will eventually be enabled for everyone, but the migration will be slow. Whether you use the new features they enable (namely, posting directly to your profile) is optional. In the case where you don't use it, the new profile pages are basically an easier-to-read version of the current overview page.

We'll never require you sync your FB account, not that it's even an option now. "
240," This is the domain of the Anti-Evil team that I've mentioned in previous posts. They are the engineering team whose mandate is to prevent those who cheat, manipulate, and otherwise attempt to undermine Reddit.

I can't get too specific in this forum, but we detect and prevent manipulation in a variety of ways, generally looking at where accounts come from, how they work together, and behaviors of groups of accounts that differ from typical behavior.

Folks have been trying to manipulate Reddit for a long time, so this is not a new problem for us. Their tactics and our responses do evolve over time, so it's been constant work for us over the years. "
241, Is there even such a thing as a group of squid? I thought they were they were independent types. 
242," Hello Everyone!

Its been a few months since I last did one of these, so I thought Id check in and share a few updates.

Its been a busy few months here at HQ. On the product side, we launched [Reddit-hosted video and gifs](https://www.reddit.com/domain/v.redd.it/); [crossposting](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6vths0/beta_crossposting_better_attribution_for_cat/) is in beta; and Reddits web redesign is in alpha testing with a limited number of users, which well be expanding to an opt-in beta later this month. Weve got a long way to go, but the feedback weve received so far has been super helpful \(thank you!\). If youd like to participate in this sort of testing, head over to r/beta and subscribe.

Additionally, well be slowly migrating folks over to the new profile pages over the next few months, and two-factor authentication rollout should be fully released in a few weeks. Weve made many other changes as well, and if youre interested in following along with all these updates, you can subscribe to r/changelog.

In real life, we finished our moderator thank you tour where we met with hundreds of moderators all over the US. It was great getting to know many of you, and we received a ton of good feedback and product ideas that will be working their way into production soon. The next major release of the native apps *should* make moderators happy \(but you never know how these things will go\).

Last week we expanded our content policy to clarify our stance around violent content. The previous policy forbade inciting violence, but we found it lacking, so we expanded the policy to cover any content that encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence or physical harm against people or animals. We dont take changes to our policies lightly, but we felt this one was necessary to continue to make Reddit a place where people feel welcome.

update: I'm taking off for now. Thanks for the questions and feedback. I'll check in over the next couple of days if more bubbles up. Cheers! "
243, mod me pls 
244,"  You wouldn't be negative if you understood what I'm doing. Once I'm finished you'll like it. If you don't like it, you'll probably be done complaining by then and I can continue doing what I want.

You're not wrong. It's more like, once we've released more, your feedback will be more valuable, but right now the product is in its infancy so it doesn't make much sense. That said, we've actually have learned a lot, so I'm content with the current situation. "
245," I more or less answered this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/6qptzw/with_so_much_going_on_in_the_world_i_thought_id/dkz5xi4/).

The short answer is: there was some good feedback in that thread, but also plenty that isn't super relevant. With profile pages in particular, I think showing will be better than telling. It's going to take some time for it to be a cohesive product.

The feedback was received, and I think when the dust settles it'll be received much better.

Update: I realize I didn't actually give you a a product update. Profile pages as a feature are about 25% complete. We have a lightly redesigned page (temporary) and personal subreddits. This gives people a place to post, but not much incentive to do so. What we're missing that we believe makes this feature more cohesive are privacy controls, smart comment display (most reddit original content are in comments), and x-posting as a first-class feature (e.g. u/shitty_watercolour can post to his profile and he or others can x-post in r/comics or r/funny or whatever). I generally don't like sharing features before they actually exist, but that's the gist of what's to come over the next couple of months. "
246," That was an outdated rule from before users could make their own subreddits. Reddit was one community, and we felt it was unfair to promote only one thing. Reddit was all links (this was before self posts as well) back then with very little original content.

However, times have changed. 

The 10% rule was hostile to original content producers, which is ironic because original content is the most valuable. Why would we require you post 9 random posts for every 1 original post?

Moderators are free to moderator however they like, however.
 "
247," I don't think so, but it's never really been a first-class citizen. "
248," Yep. We miss u/AchievementUnlockd, but the team continues to grow. I hope you haven't felt a decline in our outreach. I believe it's higher than ever (we measure this a lot of ways, but one of them is the number of r/modsupport posts that have constructive answers, from us or others).

New feature roll-outs generally include a fair amount of mod testing. Right now it's video, the redesign, and profile pages in the spotlight. "
249," I meant profile pages as a singular noun for the feature. Can't decide if I want to change it.

Your feedback is valuable, and we'll take it into consideration. "
250," Assuming we're talking about profile pages...

 If there is negative feedback during the beta stage of a feature, isn't it much more beneficial for a company to roll back

Not always. It takes time to get these things right, which is why we're moving slowly. We received a lot of feedback, some of which was actionable (e.g. more privacy controls), some of which isn't useful (e.g. you're turning in Facebook!).

The reality is the feature isn't yet cohesive, so much of the user feedback lacks context. I wish we could do a perfect job explaining what we're trying to do, but sometimes it's better to just build it, launch it, and see how it's used. In this case, we're still early in the process. "
251," You are making a couple of incorrect assumptions.

We've reduced spam by 95% over the last year. There is significantly less spam to report. Yes, there is still spam, and reporting it is still valuable.

It's true you don't get an admin response on every report. We receive millions of reports every month. The entire company is 230 people, with the T S team being significantly smaller, so we can't possible respond to every one of them. The reports are valuable, however. They point the T S and AE teams in the right direction so they can fight abuse at scale.

You may feel we're less sincere, but we're not. We all love Reddit as much as ever, and our goal is to make it as good as possible. We can't do everything at once,  and we know we have a long way to go, but we've made a lot of progress.
 "
252," It might be in a test...

Imagine a dropdown that says ""Popular In"" and upon clicking it you see options like Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand. "
253,"  instead inviting more and more of the kind of people who are alright being locked in just one particular camp

r/gatekeeping

Stop. Reddit is 300M+ people. It's a big place, and according to users, it has been in steady decline for over a decade now.

The reality is not everyone is interested in an English-only, US-centric view of the world.

The work we are doing is purely additive. Don't like geo-popular? Don't use it. Don't like profile pages? Don't use it. Want to hang out on r/all all day? Cool. It's not going anywhere. "
254," It's just a menu. You can choose which view you'd like to see. The only real change is that a new user visiting in specific location will by default see things biased by other users in that location.

For example, go to https://www.reddit.com/r/popular/ on the web and play with the ""popular in"" dropdown below Hot. "
255," The r/spam removal had very little impact on reports, as r/spam had relatively little impact on spam overall. The improvement in reports is mostly on the harassment side (many of which don't come from moderators but individual users). "
256,"  who invested the millions and millions in Reddit

The main investors were Andreessen Horowitz, Coatue, Fidelity, Sequoia, and Vy.

 and did they have requirements?

The main requirement is that we grow the business so one day they get a return. We all agree that Reddit is an incredible opportunity. Yes, we're large now with 300M users, but we're one of a few companies that has a legitimate opportunity for a billion+ users someday. "
257," You.

As opposed to people we bring into the office for the explicit purpose of testing. "
258," Yes, you can target based on subs, geo, and interests today. "
259," This is the domain of the Anti-Evil team. Yes, we look for this stuff. If you see examples of fishiness, you can always PM me, and I'll forward to the team. "
260," 1) We generally exclude NSFW from any sort of personalization

2) The main goal of profile pages is to give folks a place to host their content, not to build a social network. While the feature is far from completeit'll be much more cohesive in a couple monthsyou won't be required to share your identity, have friends, etc. "
261, Why not? Digg4 was the best thing that ever happened to Reddit. 
262, Indeed it does! 
263," Not today, but real users should be seeing it in August! "
264," It creates a development burden with little gain, so it's mostly a distraction. We spend time talking about how DNT should effect such and such feature, but the user gets relatively little benefit.

While it wouldn't be my preferred approach on Reddit, if you really want to control how you're tracked online, you should use an ad blocker. "
265," Sort of, but not exactly. On Reddit, you will have control. You can curate your own listing (i.e. Home), see what the world is into today (r/popular), or see what other parts of the world are into (geo popular). We believe giving the user explicit control is the way to go. "
266," In some cases I think we were able to provide valuable perspective.

On the whole, given the craziness of last Thursday (the healthcare vote), I was impressed they were so engaged with us. Many took time out of a crazy day to chat. "
267," Hitting Reddit's front page with organic-looking content is valuable, so there will always be people trying to game us. Everyone once and a while it succeeds, but rarely more than once.

We do a couple things to fight this: the Anti-Evil team looks for vote cheating and the like, and we provide legitimate alternatives through advertising that are hopefully easier and cheaper than gaming us. "
268," It's an engineering team, so they go through the normal engineering hiring process. AE is a fun team to be on, and that type of work was some of my favorite when I was an engineer. It's creative and challenging workevery day you're facing off against other humans who are trying to ruin Reddit. It's an arms race, but we generally have more resources than the bad guys. "
269," Who told you about the paddling pool?

We build models of past bad behavior to detect future bad behavior before it hits scale (report abuse, login bots, etc). "
270," It's a priority, but not a top priority, which means we will continue to invest in revenue growth, but dedicate the majority of our resources into improving the product for the time being. "
271," Headcount, mostly.

We have a lot to build, some of which we've shared (e.g. the redesign and video), and some we haven't shared yet (but we are excited to!), and we need more people to get it all done. "
272," This is a reasonable concern that we share.

On one hand, we want the site to be more relevant to folks all over the world, and geo-specific versions of Reddit increase the odds that a first time user will find something relevant to them.

However, if we get really good at relevancy that means we've gotten really good at creating echo-chambers, which is not our goal.

For as far as we can see, there will continue to be a few different ways to interact with Reddit: your Home feed, which is stuff you've explicitly chosen, r/popular, which is stuff the whole world finds interesting, and optional geo versions of r/popular, which are a little more specific to your location.

The product evolution is fluid, and we'll keep an eye on things as we evolve. "
273," Trust   Safety is the team that enforces our content policy. They fight abuse, harassment, spam, cheating, etc.

Anti-Evil is the engineering team that builds tools for T S and fights abuse at scale. They work closely together, and have made quite an impact in the last year. "
274, Why not both? 
275," Yes. And, we're investing more in the AMP (trimmed down, super fast) version as well.

 I dont use reddit often enough to justify the app

You're a first commenter on an AMA... "
276," Hi All,

Weve got some updates to share about Reddit the platform, community, and business:

First off, thank you to all of you who participated in the Net Neutrality Day of Action earlier this month! We believe a free and open Internet is the most important advancement of our lifetime, and its preservation is paramount. Even if the FCC chooses to disregard public opinion and rolls back existing Net Neutrality regulations, the fight for Internet freedom is far from over, and Reddit will be there. Alexis and I just returned from Washington, D.C. where we met with members and senators on both sides of the aisle and shared your [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) and passion about this issue. Thank you again for [making your voice heard](https://redditblog.com/2017/07/14/redditors-rally-on-the-day-of-action-to-save-net-neutrality/).

Were happy to report Reddit IRL is alive and well: while in D.C., we hosted one of a series of meetups around the country to connect with moderators in person, and back in June, Redditors gathered for Global Reddit Meetup Day across 120 cities worldwide. We have a few more meetups planned this year, and so far its been great fun to connect with everyone face to face.

Reddit has [closed another round of funding](https://www.recode.net/2017/7/31/16037126/reddit-funding-200-million-valuation-steve-huffman-alexis-ohanian). This is an important milestone for the company, and while Reddit the business continues to grow and is healthier than ever, the additional capital provides even more resources to build a Reddit that is accessible, welcoming, broad, and available to everyone on the planet. I want to emphasize our values and goals are not changing, and our investors continue to support our mission.

On the product side, we have a lot going on. Its incredible how much were building, and were excited to show you over the coming months. Our video beta continues to expand. A few hundred communities have access, and have been critical to working out bugs and polishing the system. Were creating more [geo-specific](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6j3dkw/testing_geo_popular_your_local_frontpage_of_the/) views of Reddit, and the web redesign (codename: Reddit4) is well underway. I cant wait for you all to see what were working on. The redesign is a massive effort and will take months to deploy. We'll have an alpha end of August, a public beta in October, and we'll see where the feedback takes us from there.

Were making some changes to our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). Specifically, were phasing out Do Not Track, which isnt supported by all browsers, doesnt work on mobile, and is implemented by fewif anyadvertisers, and replacing it with our own [privacy controls](https://www.reddit.com/personalization). DNT is a nice idea, but without buy-in from the entire ecosystem, its impact is limited. In place of DNT, we're adding in new, more granular privacy controls that give you control over how Reddit uses any data we collect about you. This applies to data we collect both on and off Reddit  (some of which ad blockers dont catch). The information we collect allows us to serve you both more relevant content and ads. While there is a tension between privacy and personalization, we will continue to be upfront with you about what we collect and give you mechanisms to opt out. Changes go into effect in 30 days.

Our Community, Trust   Safety, and Anti-Evil teams are hitting their stride. For the first time ever, the majority of our enforcement actions last quarter were proactive instead of reactive. This means were catching abuse earlier, and as a result we saw over 1M fewer moderator reports despite traffic increasing over the same period (speaking of which, we updated [community traffic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6pxyvy/traffic_page_update_now_includes_data_from_all/) numbers to be more accurate).

While there is plenty more to report, Ill stop here. If you have any questions about the above or anything else, Ill be here a couple hours.

Steve

u: I've got to run for now. Thanks for the questions! I'll be back later this evening to answer some more. "
277," Maybe! The only reason I'm certain it wasn't screen is that I distinctly remember learning about screen thinking, ""this will make things so much easier!"" "
278," That's right. We ran Reddit out of a long-living CMUCL process. Instead of reloading everything, I (I'm always hesitant to use I instead of We, but it was really just me doing the dev at the time) updated the process one function at a time by pasting in newly updated code. Because of this, the instance of Reddit running in production wasn't necessarily documented in any specific code. It resembled more a well-aged cheese cultureimpossible to reproduce.  "
279, Ok.  
280, It was not. 
281, They can have CSS too. 
282," It won't be one or the other, but CSS won't affect mobile. "
283," The alpha will be a separate website, so, yes. "
284, 2599: Choose wisely. 
285," I like onions. I don't love onions. I didn't like them as a kid, but they say your tastes change every seven years, and I adopted onions in my 20s.

The real enemy here are olives. "
286, We're building a new flair system that's way more powerful than what you have to do now. 
287," It was u/powerlanguage. I've been telling him for weeks he's crazy, but r/place really went to his head.

But, actually... Everything I said in the last post is still true. CSS shouldn't be the only way to customize a community. We are still going to build a structured system, which will be more accessible, cross-platform, and less brittle. If we do a job with this and the widget system, I expect CSS to be less required, but we can leave CSS for more advanced use-cases.

Happy Cakeday! "
288," r/HighQualityGifs 

Actually, nvm. Leave us out. "
289," Hi Mods,

I wanted to follow up on the [CSS and redesign post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/66q4is/the_web_redesign_css_and_mod_tools/) from a few weeks back and provide some more information as well as clarify some questions that have emerged.

Based on your feedback, we will allow you to continue to use CSS on top of the new structured styles. This will be the last part of the customization tool we build as we want to make sure the structured options we are offering are rock solid. Also, please keep in mind that if you do choose to use the advanced option, we will no longer be treading as carefully as we have done in the past about breaking styles applied through CSS^1.

To give you a sense of our approach, were starting with a handful of highly-customized communities (e.g. r/overwatch and r/gameofthrones) and seeing how close we can get to their existing appearance using the new system. Logos, images, colors, spoilers, menus, flairs (all kinds), and lots more will be supported. I know youd like to see a list of everything, but we think the best approach will be to show instead of tell, which were racing to as quickly as possible.

The widget system I mentioned in the last post isnt directly related. Many communities have added complex functionality over the years (calendars, scoreboards, etc). A widget system will elevate these features to first-class status on Reddit, with the aim of making them both more powerful and reuseable. Yes, were evaluating how we would accept user-created widgets.  We intend for widgets to be able to be updated via the API, so youll still be able to create dynamically updating content in your subreddit sidebar.

This change, and the redesign in general, is going to happen slowly.  We will will not be abruptly cutting everyone over to the new site at once.  We know it wont be perfect at first (unlike the current site), and plan to include plenty of time to solicit feedback and make iterations.  Sharing our plans for subreddit customization this far advance with you is part of this process.

Well start with a small alpha group and create a subreddit to solicit feedback.  As we continue to add features, well expand the testing group to an opt-in beta.  If youd like to participate in the alpha please add a reply to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/6auyq9/reddit_is_procss/dhhmebb/).  Please note, signing up does not guarantee a spot in the alpha.  We want to be able to be responsive to the alpha testers, and keeping the initial group small has proved to be effective in the past.

Id like thank everyone who has provided feedback on this topic.  There have been some very [constructive](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/677rba/some_brainstorming_about_potential_widgets_in_the) [threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/66rdiy/crowdsourcing_new_subreddit_widgets/).  Id also like to take a moment to appreciate how civil the feedback has been.  This is a topic many of you feel passionate about.  Thank you for keeping things constructive.

Cool?

Cool.

 nbsp;

^1 No snark allowed. "
290,"  I bet you have cooties

Yeah? Guess where I got them. "
291," Hey All,

I just wanted to leave a quick note and say were listening to all the feedback around CSS / customization. The quietness on my end is because Im traveling and wont have a couple hours to chat until next week, and I want to make sure I have time to answer questions. I appreciate all the feedback so far (and the fact that its been overwhelmingly polite!).

Cheers,

Steve "
292," Favorite cs book is probably Ansi Common Lisp or On Lisp by Paul Graham.

Favorite non cs book... probably whatever I read last, which is approximately: Pre-suasion, Deep simplicity, the Dark Tower series. "
293," My best languages over the years:

BASIC - C - Pascal - Java - Lisp - Python - Not Javascript
 "
294," I don't spend a lot of time thinking about the competition. We try to build what's best for Reddit. Even if we end up copying someone, we know we came to the same conclusion from first principles. "
295,"  I very badly want to create something with my own hands that other people use.

Stick with this. I often say I'd be happy installing garage door openers for people. It's fun when other people appreciate your work. We're fortunate that at Reddit we can do it on a worldwide scale, but the feeling is the same. "
296," 1. In the beginning, we didn't have a vision. Every day we worked on what we felt like each day. One one hand this was a good thing: the site came from a pure, organic place. One the other, we didn't have a long term vision to focus us, which is why we sold so early.

2. Hash passwords.

3. Spend time with my friends. Ski. Read Reddit. Read books.

4. Test your assumptions. Have a bug? Make sure all your assumptions about the surrounding code are correct. Fix a bug? Make sure you can reproduce it and fix it again. Even if it seems like a waste of time, it's a good use of time. "
297," I had been programming since I was 7. It was my first love. I don't know what else I would have majored in, honestly.

It won't be saturated anytime soon. "
298," We left because we got acquired.

My friends moved here because the startup ecosystem is more mature. If you're starting a company, it's easier to raise money here. If you're looking for work, there are more opportunities. The gap is closing, but the Bay is still the best.

The weather doesn't hurt either. "
299," Sure, it's possible, but a little harder. School and work force you to do things you might not do on your own, and the willingness to do such things is usually a good signal. "
300," We do ask questions like these. It's usually framed as, how would you build a service that does X? And then we ask follow up questions until one of us is stumped. It's actually a fairly fun line of questioning because we'll see new ideas from time to time.

Most of my interviewing these days is either the first or last conversation with people, and it's less me interviewing and more me pitching Reddit. "
301, Where I have the top post of all time. 
302,"  Do you have any advice on what I can work on to improve myself?

I find it's often best to give yourself a project. It helps focus your attention. Pick a product you like (Reddit?) and see if you can build it yourself.

 Do companies look at gpa first to determine if I even receive an interview?

I can't speak for others, but if you don't put your GPA on your resume, I'm not going to ask. "
303," It's not too late. The curse of young people is that they all thing they're old.

Our head of platform didn't start programming until he was about your age. "
304, Yep! One of the hallmarks of experience is getting better at making the right tradeoffs. 
305," When it started, u/kn0thing and I submitted all the content.

I had a script that would scrape a bunch of websites (Slashdot, Boingboing, etc) and print all the links it had never seen before. The first day it printed a bunch of navigational garbage, but on the second day it was all interesting content. We'd write titles for the those links and submit them to Reddit.

Our submit page looked a little bit different: we had an extra field for username. Reddit would automatically register that name if it was available and submit the link as that ""new"" user.

We did this for about 4 months, if I recall. "
306, The general skill is to make your peers' lives easier. Being a good manager is all about unblocking your people so they can focus on what they're good it. 
307," My pleasure, thanks for your help today! "
308, I have. It's very common. My advice is it's time to make a change! 
309,"  Do you think this leads to any ""cliquey-ness"" in the industry?

I suppose it can. It really depends what you mean by culture. Culture are the things we have in common, so it depends on what you want those things to be. For example Reddit hires a lot of optimists. Does that make us cliquey? Maybe. It also makes Reddit a cheery place to work.

 Are there certain personality traits that, while maybe not flaws per se, just don't gel with your workplace culture?

Ego that outpaces your skill really grinds my gears.

 How much can a great attitude make up for underdeveloped skills?

A great attitude leads to great skills!

 How much can great programming skills make up for an underdeveloped personality? What is a ""bad personality""?

I think if you're the sort of person asking these questions, you're probably fine. It's the people unaware of themselves that are unpleasant to work with.
 "
310," Write as much code as possible and as broadly as possible. Games, AI, databases, it's all useful eventually.

What I love most about my job is that I never want for a sense of purpose. My work matters. "
311," Not really. We're interviewing the candidate, not the school. My advice would be to worry about your own skills and not so much whether your peers are knuckleheads. "
312," First, gut-check what you don't like about the company. Make sure it's not something about yourself that you can fix. Otherwise, you'll get a new job and feel the same way in 6 months.

Just a few months at a company raises some questions. We'll be asking why it's so short, and trying to determine whether it's you or the company. 

We'd suss out your level during the recruiting process. "
313," For entry level developers I'm looking for three things:

* Do you have skills? If you can write a hashtable, list, and tree in C, you are probably good.
* Do you have a passion for programming?
* Are you a pleasant person to be around? For beginners, I'm looking for high skill and low ego. For whatever reason, newbies tend to have low skill and high ego. "
314," I'm sorry, I don't have a great answer for you: when we started Reddit, we didn't have a vision for the future. Our product planning horizon was about 1 day. I mostly didn't want to look stupid in front of Paul Graham, who made our first investment.

As for how to make something big, that's a broad question. I suppose if I were to distill it into a single point: it's put yourself in a position to build something big:

* Work on an idea that can actually be big
* Surround yourself with people with similar aspirations
* Work at a company with people who know what they're doing "
315," Make yourself invaluable to your employer. The advice I give to young hires is ask yourself each day, ""am I making my manager's life easier or harder?""

If you want to primarily write code, primarily write code. You have a lot of agency here. However, it might be worth giving management a spin someday. Maybe you'll like it! "
316," I'd love to, but it is so much work! I don't know if I have time to do a good job on it these days. "
317," If you asked me ten years ago if I would be happy in a job where I rarely programmed, I would have been shocked that would even be a possibility.

Management is a lot of fun, actually. There is a lot that goes into getting people in alignment and working towards a shared vision. It's also satisfying to unwind and fix people problems. I learn something new every day.

I don't know if I have regrets. I'd like to say I wish I invested in learning these skills sooner, but I appreciate them more now when I can look back at how ineffective I've been in the past. "
318," Don't need to. New search is in the works. This summer, hopefully. "
319," Leaving Hipmunk to come back to Reddit. While CEO of Reddit is basically my dream job, leaving Hipmunk was heartbreaking. "
320, Negative. 
321," It's evolved over the years. During my prime programming years, I blasted Metallica and the like, but my tastes are pretty broad. I considered myself extremely fortunate to have a job where I could listen to music all day.

I love dancing. These days I listen to a lot of funk and danceable edm, with a liberal amount of Beatles and Fleetwood Mac mixed in to chill out.

 "
322," I love them. I've been volunteering at [Hackbright](https://hackbrightacademy.com/) for a while now. Before that, I spent time at [Devbootcamp](https://devbootcamp.com/). I love working with beginners, and more often than you think it leads to great hires. You find the sort of people who are willing to take risks, work hard, and have big chips on their shoulders. They make great employees. "
323, Native mobile is a great place to start. Good Android engineers are hard to find and in high demand. 
324," Don't fight it. If you're tired at the end of the day, do something else*.

Motivation is a funny thing. Many times I've gone through phases where when I get home, the last thing I want to do is look at a computer. I usually bounce back.

*I meant at home, but I suppose you can change it up at work as well.

 "
325," Well, my advice for anyone in a college town is to take advantage of it. You're surrounded by a ton of smart and hungry people. It's a great hiring advantage.

Cville-specific... Don't forget to go outside. I miss the scenery around there: it's good for your spirit. "
326," Lightly at the moment.  Before building a brain, I always advocate building a simple heuristic-based algorithm first. The new frontpage algorithms and ads targeting are getting into this area, but I keep telling the team: DON'T BUILD A BRAIN. Yet. "
327," Yes, we still use it. We used it at Hipmunk as well. There are a handful of reasons for it:

* It's more fair. We're paying people for their level of work, not their ability to negotiate.
* I'd rather start our relationship happy that we found a good fit rather than tense from a negotiation.
* I get no enjoyment getting someone for cheap, but the hire gets a lot of disappointment.
* It's easier. We look up your level in the chart, and that's it. We don't have to do any internal negotiation either.

Every company is different. Some will lowball you because they think they have to. Some will lowball you because they're assholes. Some will come in really high because they have tons of money. We make our best offer first. Take the advice for what it is, but know that it only applies in some situations. "
328," It's going ok. I've never been a great manager. These days I manage executives, who by nature are self-managing.

One thing that helped me is acknowledging my strengths and weaknesses, and playing to the former while minimizing the latter. I'm a good mentor and coach, but I can also be scattered and aloof. I still love working with beginners, but I'm not great a project managing.

When I fire people, I try to get myself into a mental state where I want to do it. Sometimes it's because the person who we're letting go will actually be happier elsewhere. Other times, I think about the time and stress I'm saving someone else on the team. "
329," With any luck, you will be intimidated your entire career. My point is, people who think they have a lot to learn, learn a lot more and more quickly. Do yourself a favor and constantly surround yourself with intimidating people.

You don't need to know every last algorithm, language, and framework, but you do need a enough of a foundation that you could.

 was efficiency and code cleanliness always your priority

hahaha. Have you seen the Reddit code base? The stuff I wrote is a mess. There are lots of reasons for this:

* I was a worse programmer back then
* Ten years and dozens of engineers in a code base often leads to a mess
* We made tradeoffs to ship quickly.

Quality is something that has always been important to me, but more important has been results. Users don't care about your code quality. Plus, every line you write, you probably be able to write it better in a year (because you have more skills and context). "
330," Cliche answer: try to find the one that satisfies both. Some people really just want to work hard and live at work. That was me for a while.

These days, I put a lot more thought into my life outside of work. I know I can't be effective at work if I'm stressed, not getting exercise, missing my friends, not sleeping, etc. "
331, My pleasure! Thanks for having me. 
332," I've had favorites over the years for different reasons:

* Lisp: It's so flexible you can adapt to almost any style. The first version of Reddit was written in Common Lisp.
* C: you can't program C without really knowing how computers work.
* Python: My favorite language to read, write, and teach in. Reddit is primarily Python.
* Go: As I've aged, I've developed a deeper and deeper appreciate for types. Go seems to have the right balance of real-word practicality, modern features, and a Python-like feeling of coherence when you finally get it right. "
333," There are few things you are learning now that *aren't* transferable into the future, so don't worry too much about that.

There are two paths to becoming a CTO:

* Start your own company and be the CTO (that's basically what I did).
* Be the best engineer at the company you work for, and by best engineer, it's more than just being a good programmer. You need to be able to communicate up and down; have a high enough ego to be confident in your decisions, and a low enough ego to constantly be learning; and be flexible enough to take on all sorts of challenges, engineering or not.

e: typo "
334," I often talk to students who are struggling with the decision of whether to go to a company, join a startup, or start their own thing. The truth is, there isn't a wrong answer. The only wrong answer is to do multiple things at once. No matter what you choose, work hard and keep your mind open to learning. There is plenty of time in life to do all these things. You can always change your mind. "
335," The strongest newbie's I've hired have a couple things in common:

* They have a great attitude. They work on every problem thrown at them, and when they have nothing to do, they find more work. One guy I work with (who worked with me at Hipmunk and is now at Reddit), used to sit next to me and just fix my bugs. I could move a lot faster, and he learned a ton.

* They study outside of work. I think this advice holds true forever, but it's certainly true in the beginning: even a single weekend of studying a specific technology will make you dramatically better. The aforementioned engineer was trying to get better at frontend. Instead of waiting for the work to come to him, he learned an incredible amount of CSS in one weekend and came to work on Monday ready to take on a never level of work he couldn't do on Friday. "
336,"  Does that letter apply to both of my applications or only one? 

Not sure. PM me, and I will investigate.

 Also, I noticed you have a lot of Senior positions available. How do you feel about engineers who don't have the required number of years experience applying to those positions?

If you can walk the walk, years of experience don't matter.

 "
337," **Reddit specific**

We're not doing a formal internship program this yearwe just have too much going on to do a good job on it. That said, every once and a while someone slips through the cracks into a job here...

**Generic Advice**

Whenever I'm looking at interns / beginners, I'm primarily looking for someone who both has a great attitude and a passion for programming. I know we're hiring someone who doesn't know everything (and hopefully they know that as well...), but the hope is that we're finding the people who will never actually be on the job market (i.e. they get hired as an intern and their employer never lets them go). We have a handful of such folks here. "
338," Hello r/cscareerquestions, Im Steve Huffman, aka u/Spez. I founded both Reddit and Hipmunk (where I was CTO). Until about a year and a half ago, I was a full time engineer. I started programming as a kid, and worked as a developer through high school and college at Virginia (CS major). As some of you may know, u/kn0thing made a bet on Twitter with one of your mods that if you hit this subscriber milestone, I would answer all your CS career questions. Congratulations at hitting 100K subscribers, glad youre on Reddit! And, yes, [were hiring](https://about.reddit.com/careers/)...

Update: I'm taking off for now. I'll check back in this evening for a few more questions. Thanks for the questions, and thanks to the moderators! "
339," Just replying here so you know that I've seen it.

These are all great examples of cool stuff folks have done with CSS, and there are many more.

My goal today is to affirm that while CSS isn't the technology of the future for us, subreddit customization is important, and we're going to continue to evolve it.

I doubt I can convince you today with anything I say, but we're going to move forward, test carefully, and I hope you'll be a part of the process. "
340," I knew someone would do this. If I wasn't on an ipad in a college cafeteria, I'd figure out how to fix. "
341, Cool. Thanks! 
342," I would advice to continue developing until the new stuff is real. Who knows, maybe we'll screw it up and never release it... "
343," All of them except HQG, which we're going to shut down for being stupid and meta. "
344," It will be available well in advance, yes. That's why we're here now.

We'll help with the transition for communities that want it. "
345," Yes, if we can find a way to make it cross-platform and secure. "
346," While I do get paid, I don't do it for the money.

You've touched the lives of thousands (millions?) of people, and should be proud.

Stay in contact, and we'll find more ways to collaborate. "
347," Agreed! We have the basics in the app, but still quite a ways to go. "
348, The API isn't going anywhere. 
349," We hear you, and have some of the same anxiety, which is why we're here now. Giving users a blank canvas has led to many wonderful developments on Reddit. This is not lost on us, and we'll work hard to continue to provide these surfaces for creativity.

We're thinking through a widget system to allow for the sort of functionality you're currently adding through CSS/markdown hacks. "
350," When I say Styles, I mean custom styling: images, colors, themes, menus. We're keeping the functionality, but changing the technology. "
351," We'll be testing over the summer and go from there. I'd like to be more specific, but this is a big project that's a little difficult to nail down. "
352, Yep. We'll keep the current site running for quite a while. We're not planning a violent switch. That would be suicide. 
353," .

Ok "
354," No. It was awesome work, and we hope you continue to help your fellow mods.

Saying it was for nothing would be like saying all the work I and the team did on the current site was for nothing.

We should all be proud of what we've accomplished, but know that everything evolves over time. "
355, Yes. Bringing styles and as much of sidebar functionality as possible to mobile is an explicit goal of this project. 
356," We're redesigning the site, which means the DOM (the underlying structure of the site) is going to change, which would break CSS and mod tools if we did nothing. What I'm explaining here is what we're going to do about it:

* provide a new system of styling that isn't married to the DOM
* provide hooks into Reddit for mod tools that is less brittle "
357," Yes, we're replacing CSS with a set of tools for customizing the appearance of your subreddit. One of the reasons for this is to make custome styling more accessible to those who are not as technically literate. "
358," The effort spent on CSS wasn't in vain. It's what got us here. Now we'll make it easier.

We're going to support flair as a first-class citizen. "
359," Yes, that's the explicit plan. We need to detach tools from the DOM so we can change the DOM without breaking the tools. "
360," No!

We love custom styling. It means we'll bring that flavor to the apps, and we can modify the underlying code of the site without constantly breaking styles. "
361," There are multiple reasons:

* Yes, make it easier to use generally
* Yes, more inviting to new users
* Increase developer speed. Rewrites are a last resort, but Reddit runs on a lot of old code, and development in the current code base is painfully slow. "
362," Stylesheets, yes. Styles, no. Does that make sense? "
363," Hi Mods,

You may recall from my [announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5q4qmg/out_with_2016_in_with_2017/) earlier this year that I mentioned were currently working on a full redesign of the site, which brings me to the two topics I wanted to talk to you about today: Custom Styles and Mod Tools.

##**Custom Styles**

Custom community styles are a key component in allowing communities to express their identity, and we want to preserve this in the site redesign. For a long time, weve used CSS as the mechanism for subreddit customization, but well be deprecating CSS during the redesign in favor of a new system over the coming months. While CSS has provided a wonderful creative canvas to many communities, it is not without flaws:

* Its web-only. Increasing users are viewing Reddit on mobile (over 50%), where CSS is not supported. Wed love for you to be able to bring your spice to phones as well.
* CSS is a pain in the ass: its difficult to learn; its error-prone; and its time consuming.
* Some changes cause confusion (such as changing the subscription numbers).
* CSS causes us to move slow. Wed like to make changes more quickly. Youve asked us to improve things, and one of the things that slows us down is the risk of breaking subreddit CSS (and third-party mod tools).

Were designing a new set of tools to address the challenges with CSS but continue to allow communities to express their identities. These tools will allow moderators to select customization options for key areas of their subreddit across platforms. For example, header images and flair colors will be rendered correctly on desktop and mobile.

We know great things happen when we give users as much flexibility as possible. The menu of options well provide for customization is still being determined. Our starting point is to replicate as many of the existing uses that already exist, and to expand beyond as we evolve.

We will also natively supporting a lot of the functionality that subreddits currently build into the sidebar via a widget system. For instance, a calendar widget will allow subreddits to easily display upcoming events. Wed like this feature and many like it to be accessible to all communities.

How are we going to get there? Well be working closely with as many of you as possible to design these features. The process will span the next few months. We have a lot of ideas already and are hoping youll help us add and refine even more. The transition isnt going to be easy for everyone, so well assist communities that want help (i.e. well do it for you). u/powerlanguage will be reaching out for alpha testers.

##**Mod Tools**

Mod tools have evolved over time to be some of the most complex parts of Reddit, both in terms of user experience and the underlying code.  We know that these tools are crucial for the maintaining the health of your communities, and  we know many of you who moderate very large subreddits depend on third-party tools for your work. Not breaking these tools is constantly on our mind (for better or worse).

Were in contact with the devs of Toolbox, and would like to work together to port it to the redesign. Once that is complete, well begin work on updating these tools, including supporting natively the most requested features from Toolbox.

The existing site and the redesigned site will run in parallel while we make these changes. That is, we dont have plans for turning off the current site anytime soon. If you depend on functionality that has not yet been transferred to the redesign, you will still have a way to perform those actions.

While we have your attention were also growing our internal team that handles spam and bad-actors. Our current focus is on report abuse. Weve caught a lot of bad behavior. We hope you notice the difference, and well keep at it regardless.

##**Moving Forward**

We know moderation can feel janitorialthankless and repetitive. Thank you for all that you do. Our goal is to take care much of that burden so you can focus on helping your communities thrive.

Big changes are ahead. These are fundamental, core issues that well be grappling with togetherchanges to how communities are managed and express identity are not taken lightly. Well be giving you further details as we move forward, but wanted to give you a heads up early.

Thanks for reading.

update: now that I've cherry-picked all the easy questions, I'm going to take off and leave the hard ones for u/powerlanguage. I'll be back in a couple hours. "

366," We don't share any individually-identifying PII, such as emails, but we do allow advertisers to target based on location. "
367," I mention this elsewhere, but part of our strategy has been to store as little as possible to minimize surface area. However, it's not practical to store nothing (e.g. IPs and emails), and we may ask for more down the road to enable other features (e.g. friends). Where we can, we want to give you the ability to choose how you participate. "
368," Yes, I expect the number to continue to grow.

For context, check out the scale of [Google's report](https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/).

 What can we as users do or know to have a better peace of mind when it comes to our privacy on Reddit?

We only know what you tell us, and we deliberately ask for little. IP addresses, which are a little harder for you to control, we only store for 100 days.

When it comes to privacy, I do believe there is some amount of personal responsibility and education required, but we try to be helpful where we can. "
369," I believe there was a bug related to this that is now fixed. If it's still an issue, please let me know. "
370," Sure. We can always improve, but here are a few examples:

* We're dialing up our presence on r/modsupport
* Our goal is to keep ticket response times under 12 hours (our average is less than this)
* We just released the first version of [mod tools for mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/60w4x6/mod_tools_available_in_the_mobile_apps/)
* For big site features, e.g. the redesign, subreddit rules, post-to-profile, we work closely with mods during development

e: typo "
371,"  Emergency Disclosure Requests can be made to Reddit to compel us to disclose user account information in certain circumstances when we believe disclosure is necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. When notified of a potential emergency situation by law enforcement, we require law enforcement to provide enough information to satisfy Reddit that the standard is met, and further require that the law enforcement officer certify the request in writing. "
372," Yep, I'm a fan. "
373," Yes, if it was a valid copyright request, that's what the DMCA requires. We could push back, but our appetite for defending you all has limits. "
374, What happens in these cases is we notify law enforcement and ask them to send a formal request. Those formal requests are counted in the report. 
375, We don't share individual browsing habits with advertisers. You can read the full details in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/). 
376," Yes, pretty sure it's on the roadmap for this quarter. Our focus the past couple of quarters has been to identify accounts that are likely to be taken over and protecting those (usually by issuing password resets). "
377," Unless there is a non-disclosure order with the request, we always PM the user. "
378, We didn't turn over any information for these requests 
379," Not without a valid legal request, but a warrant isn't the only form of request we receive. We have to respond to valid subpoenas and court orders as well, for example. "
380," Almost certainly. As we grow, we expect the number of these requests to grow as well. "
381,"  you are responsible for reporting it to the appropriate authorities?

It depends on the nature of the request. For something like child pornography, yes, we have to report. For something like how to make drugs, we don't. It doesn't mean we won't see a subpoena, though.

 If so, how do you reduce false positives? If not, how do you handle such a large load?

It's a lot of work, to be honest. We don't automatically do anything in this area. If it involves turning over information or removing content, we consider carefully. "
382," Hello Everyone,

We just posted our [2016 Transparency Report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2016). It details government and law-enforcement-agency requests for private information about our users. We publish it each year, and you can find previous versions [here](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/).

Our goals in publishing the report are to demonstrate Reddits commitment to remaining a place that encourages authentic conversation and to share with you the ways in which we work to protect the privacy of our users.

Generally, the types of requests we receive are subpoenas, court orders, search warrants, and emergency requests. We require all requests to be legally valid, and, in 2016, we did not produce records in response to approximately 40% of them, which is on par with previous years.

Another way in which we stand up on behalf of users is through participation in [amicus briefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amicus_curiae). Basically, we say we support a party and their position. In tech, it is one of the few areas in which many companies work together to send a strong message to courts.

We participated in a couple amicus briefs this year, including one on [behalf of Facebook](https://blog.mozilla.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/In-re-381-Search-Warrants-Amicus-Brief.pdf) in the state of New York, who was served with a bulk warrant for account information, photos, private messages, and other information for 381 individuals. Reddit joined with a number of other tech companies in supporting Facebooks arguments that questioned the legal validity of the bulk search warrant and the associated gag order which prevented Facebook from notifying its users.

Again, in support of Facebook, we joined a group to fight against a Section 230 ruling in the state of California. Section 230 essentially allows platforms like Reddit to exist because it grants broad immunity to online service providers from harms arising out of third-party content. In this case, the trial court had held that Jason Cross a/k/a Michael Knight (Knight) could seek to hold Facebook liable for failing to remove third-party content that Knight found objectionable.  Amici [filed a response](http://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/historical/1378/) in support of Facebook and to argue against the trial courts order finding that California right of publicity claims fall outside the broad scope of Section 230s immunity. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that you take this report as a sign of our commitment to your privacy and trust.

Ill answer any questions that I can, but please understand I cant always be completely candid when it comes to legal matters.

Steve (subject4807)
 "
383, Yep 
384," Let's be clear: that pitch that was ""one of the best he's heard,"" wasn't Reddit. Who knows what it could have been? Oh, well. There's always another train coming. "
385," \\\_()_/

When I read the comment replies out of context in my inbox, I would never have guessed they were in relation to this comment... "
386, We're going to try it out in a few admin comments. If it performs well will roll it out to a broader group. 
387," Thanks for your thoughts. While the scenario you paint is possible, I think it's the bleakest possible outcome, and one nobody wants to see happen. We still have plenty of work to do, and the feature will continue to evolve as we roll it out.

Instead of the total destruction of Reddit, what we'd like to accomplish is to make it easier for folks to find a place to share on Reddit.

Remember that time when u/GovSchwarzenegger wrote an op-ed for Reddit about marriage equality and then was immediately banned? That is so silly. Reddit is a place to share, discuss, and express yourself, and you should be able to do so without fear of immediately getting crushed. "
388,"  you're claiming setting up a subreddit with posting privileges restricted to yourself is hard

It's totally hard, which is why few people do it. Yes, we do have other problems, including a clunky UI around some of this stuff, which we're working on. "
389," Presently, everything you post on Reddit is publicly accessible on your user page. This feature actually gives you more control for what get displayed there. "
390," What we really want to see is for users who have things to share, they have a place to put it. Even I have this problem. I often have ideas for a post, but don't know which community I should submit it to. r/announcements, my main home, probably isn't appropriate. Even if I know the right community, I may not know the community norms and rules. This gives me a place to put my thoughts without worry that I'm going to get insta-banned. If someone decides it's appropriate for their community, they can x-post it. "
391," Depending on demand, that's a reasonable request. "
392," Exactly like subreddit. In fact, these are subreddit's under the hood. "
393,"  Will you counteract SEO spam posted on user's profiles at all?

We'll continue to fight spam wherever it is. We have made a lot of progress in the last year, reducing spam reports by over 90%. The vast majority of spam is not caught by automod or humans.

 How will I be able to find OC creators if not by their real name?

It's important to us that Reddit is useable without real names. Folks can choose to disclose this if they want, of course.

As for discoverability, a user's posts could be x-posted elsewhere, which is how Reddit works today, or the user may have their own community, which a handful already do now.

 Will personal posts be included in the reddit-wide search (please no)?

Search is getting a complete overhaul at the moment, so this will likely be an option.

 Will we be able to differentiate between profile and subreddit posts i.e. will Toolbox still be able to compile an accurate report of submitted domain percentages (only subreddit posts)?

That's up the toolbox devs, but it should be apparent which subreddits belong to a user and which are traditional communities.

e: punctuation "
394, Nope 
395, We haven't decided whether user pages will appear in communal spaces like r/all and r/popular. We'll see how the feature evolves. 
396,"  What if we don't want to be followed by people?

Can you elaborate?

 What if we dont want everyone to know we are active in certain subreddits especially NSFW ones?

The user will have control over which communities are displayed, if any. "
397, Yep. The feature is built on top of the existing subreddit system. 
398," In that case, I feel confident that we will exceed your expectations. "
399," I don't, actually, but it never hurts to have gold. "
400," I have three tiers of food dislike.

Tier 1: I hate them. I will spit them out. Olives.

Tier 2: I don't like them, but will get it down to be polite. Eggplant.

Tier 3: I don't like them, but I wish I did, and I'm trying. Tomatoes, Mushrooms. "
401, Probably because we merged www.reddit.com and m.reddit.com. Click the menu and choose Desktop Site to go back. 
402," If Reddit could be killed, it'd be dead by now. "
403," In that case, I feel confident that we will exceed your expectations. "
404," Not a ton, but I'm thinking [something like this](http://digg.com/). "
405," They read more, share more, create more, and come back more. "
406," I do see this problem. In fact, we've had a lot more success the past few months going after bad users instead of punishing the communities they frequent.

It's a lot easier to do so if we have the support of the mods of the relevant communities.

I have in mind to make this more explicit: a literal checkbox that says something to the effect of, ""keep the assholes out of my community."" "
407," I don't like it, but I also know sometimes it's necessary. There are a handful of things like this (e.g. auto-banning, shadow-banning) that I'd like to get rid of, but if we do so without providing a better alternative, we'd cause a lot of trouble. "
408," Next week around Wednesday. I generally don't like to make promises about dates, but I'm feeling pretty confident about this one. "
409," By testing carefully and being considerate to our users. The biggest mistake Digg made was they couldn't undo the change, or didn't want to, or just didn't.  "
410," I'd like the new version to feel like a Rolls Royce: it feels classic, but is actually modern.

The current version is more like a Chevy Vega. "
411, We test everything carefully. One of the major efforts of 2016 was both building the testing framework and the culture of experimentation. 
412, Please report or send to contact@reddit.com 
413," Karma, baby. "
414," More than 50% of the uploads are to us now. This is encouraging because we didn't really promote the feature, and the flow could be a lot better (and it will get a lot better). "
415," A little bit of column A, a little bit of column B.

As you know, solve it once by hand. Solve it twice by hand. If it's still a problem, automate it. "
416," The goal is make it better. Don't worry, many of the world's most dedicate redditors work here. We love it as much or more than you. "
417," u/andytuba is one of the maintainers, and is happily (I think?) employed here "
418,"  Will you guys work more on the image/gif hosting side of reddit? For example, some gifs are so raw that it takes forever to download. And the urls, oh god, they go on for miles.

Yep! "
419, Value #1: Evolve. 
420," Reddit, subreddit, redditor



 "
421," Yes. One of the challenges we have right now is that whether you consider our front page / or r/all, the content is lowest common denominator and not relevant to most users. Increasing relevance (i.e. showing you stuff you actually want to see) is the main goal. "
422," Not really just yet, but we won't sneak it up on you. There will be a lot of testing. "
423," I agree re charm. We don't have to lose that feeling to make things better.

Reddit still runs code that I wrote ~~ten~~ twelve years ago when I was 21. I really hope by the end of this year most of that trash is gone!

e: getting older. "
424," I hear you. The designs aren't finalized, we're mostly focused on the tech at the moment.

I would like to share an interesting learning. Since the beginning of Reddit, our product design philosophy has been to cram as much content into view as possible, our thinking being that it increases the odds that a user will see something they like. In our native mobile apps, we use a card view, which basically shows one piece of content at a time. Interestingly enough, engagement in the native apps is approximately 4x higher than the desktop.

I see this in my own usage as well. I go through a ton more content on mobile than I do on desktop. This could be because everything is pre-expanded or because the apps have infinite scroll. We'll test these things thoroughly before deploying to a wide audience, of course, but it goes to show that our intuition isn't always correct. "
425, Can't promise that. That Digg redesign was one of the greatest days in Reddit's history! 
426," Perhaps, but one of the things we'd like to achieve with a new frontpage algo is to no longer require new and rising. The goal would be for every post to get enough view to have a fair chance.

e: ""no longer require"" doesn't mean ""eliminate"" "
427, but I didn't even mess with them in 2016! 
428, My favorite is my Glock 19. 
429," 1. Yes. The limiting factor for improvements isn't ideas, it's our ancient codebase and hesitation to break things like RES and custom styles. In that respect, I feel like we've been held hostage from a development point of view (Stockholm syndrome?). That's why we're so excited to rewrite desktop web. It's going to be a doozy, but worth it in the end.

2. Please send to contact@reddit.com

3. Yes. I'll follow up there. I know it got a little derailed with Spezgiving and the holidays.

4. If u/sodypop says so, that's the way it is  "
430," Thank you! I know the team loves hearing this as well.

2017 should be a fun year. Every day our pace gets a little bit faster. "
431," Hi All,

I would like to take a minute to look back on 2016 and share what is in store for Reddit in 2017.

2016 was a transformational year for Reddit. We are a completely different company than we were a year ago, having improved in just about every dimension. We hired most of the company, creating many new teams and growing the rest. As a result, we are capable of building more than ever before.

Last year was our most productive ever. We shipped well-reviewed apps for both [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage hl=en). It is crazy to think these apps did not exist a year agoespecially considering they now account for over 40% of our content views. Despite being relatively new and not yet having all the functionality of the desktop site, the apps are fastest and best way to browse Reddit. If you havent given them a try yet, you should definitely take them for a spin.

Additionally, we built a new web tech stack, upon which we built the long promised new version [moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/5h1j48/new_modmail_now_available_for_all_subreddits) and our [mobile website](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/58ir49/reddit_change_mobile_website_architectural_revamp/). We added [image hosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4p5dm9/image_hosting_on_reddit/) on all platforms as well, which now supports the majority of images uploaded to Reddit.

We want Reddit to be a welcoming place for all. We know we still have a long way to go, but I want to share with you some of the progress we have made. Our Anti-Evil and Trust   Safety teams reduced spam by over 90%, and we released the first version of our [blocking tool](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4dmnn6/new_and_improved_block_user_feature_in_your_inbox/), which made a nice dent in reported abuse. In the wake of [Spezgiving](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/5frg1n/tifu_by_editing_some_comments_and_creating_an/), we increased actions taken against individual bad actors by nine times. Your continued engagement helps us make the site better for everyone, thank you for that feedback.

As always, the Reddit community did many wonderful things for the world. You raised a [lot](https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/5j7z3d/rcfb_buys_donates_6250_in_toys_and_cash_to_toys/) [of](https://www.donorschoose.org/reddit-gifts-for-the-teachers) [money](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExtraLife/wiki/leaderboard); stepped up to help [grieving](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/5k5xjn/does_anyone_know_a_place_that_will_remove/) [families](https://www.reddit.com/r/audioengineering/comments/4v2jbv/odd_request_for_help_my_wife_recently_died_during/?sort=top); and even helped [diagnose](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/girl-diagnosed-rare-genetic-disorder-reddit-years-inconclusive/story?id=38876898) a rare genetic disorder. There are stories like this every day, and they are one of the reasons why we are all so proud to work here. Thank you.

We have lot upcoming this year. Some of the things we are working on right now include a new frontpage algorithm, improved performance on all platforms, and [moderation tools on mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/5pxvlg/mod_tools_on_mobile_web_approveremovespam/) (native support to follow). We will publish our yearly transparency report in March.

One project I would like to preview is a rewrite of the desktop website. It is a long time coming. The desktop website has not meaningfully changed in many years; it is not particularly welcoming to new users (or old for that matter); and still runs code from the earliest days of Reddit over ten years ago. We know there are implications for community styles and various browser extensions. This is a massive project, and the transition is going to take some time. We are going to need a lot of volunteers to help with testing: new users, old users, creators, lurkers, mods, [please sign up here](https://reddit-research.typeform.com/to/TdKcop)!

Here's to a happy, productive, drama-free (ha), 2017!

Steve and the Reddit team

update: I'm off for now. Will check back in a couple hours. Thanks!
 "
432," TIL.

The other part of my comment still stands: you weren't dumb enough to do something like this. "
433," I agree entirely with this sentiment. This message needs to come from your moderators. If it does, the community has a chance. If it does not, r/the_donald is trending in the wrong direction. "
434," It's fair. Ellen wasn't the first Reddit engineer, so she probably lacked the expertise to do it, and even if she did, she was smart enough to not.

u: Since this is blowing up, let me clarify. Ellen wasn't an engineer, so she probably lacked access, and if she did have access, she wouldn't have done this. I have said many times I thought the way she was treated on Reddit was despicable. The changes we made to r/all earlier this summer would have mitigated some of the harassment, and I regret we didn't make those changes years ago. "
435," 1. I'm sorry

2. I'M SORRY

3. Thanks! "
436,"  Why did you need administrative access after quitting?

When I left, Reddit was six people, and I had the majority of the engineering knowledge, so I continued to help out even after I left.

 What supervision was there of a non-employee with admin access?

There were six of us, and we were all close friends. My actions were limited to quick fixes here and there.

 Have there been other non-employees with admin access? Are there any right now?

No, that was disabled long ago. A few notable ex-employees have distinguish mode in recognition of their contributions to Reddit.

 How was it acceptable (or even legal) to use ""a back door"" to take back privileged access that the company clearly didn't want you to have?

That's just bad reporting. Someone made a patch to remove my access. I made a patch to add it back. Nothing was done in secret. This was back in 2010. My access was removed sometime in 2010 when Reddit and I had fully separated. "
437," New frontpage alogrithm is a major initiative of ours right now. So, yes! "
438," Thank you. Appreciate the sentiment. At the end of the day, we just want you all to have a pleasant time. "
439," Right now, just them.

In the past, when a community was deliberately wasting our time, we would look for general solutions that wouldn't single out a specific community. Unfortunately, that usually causes civilian casualties (e.g. when we removed all stickies from r/all and broke sports communities).

Going forward, we'll just take away their toys specifically and move on. "
440,"  However, why not allow a small 5 minute window to change the title? It shouldn't be long enough to blow up but may be long enough to help prevent a typo

Totally reasonable. "
441," I know, I know. It's been my motto for over a decade. I honestly thought they might see some humor in it, we could find some common ground through trollery, and maybe take some of the vitriol out of our relationship. "
442, Yes 
443," I love you all, in a mostly platonic way. "
444," Because most communities use it for good. For example, sports communities for game threads and TV communities for episodes. "
445, And now it's really gone. 
446," Yeah, sorry. I started working on back when we made the algo changes to r/all months ago, but I hit some spaghetti in the code and stopped. Last week I had the right combination of incentive and free time to get it done. "
447,"  Can any admin edit a comment/post? How would we know?

No. Only engineers with access to production data, and that is being limited.

 Has this ever happened before?

In 2009 I replaced the word ""fag"" with ""fog"". Over the years I have fixed typos in titles when people ask since we don't allow title editing by default.

This whole experience has been pretty painful. Even with the best of intentions, I (we) won't do this again.

 Are there any clear cut policies for what constitutes a ban-worthy offense for a sub-reddit?

The clear cut policies are in our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy).
 "
448," admins (employees) can't do this in general. It's because I had access to everything as an engineer, which we are limiting going forward. "
449, I used emacs for about 15 years before switching to 2 years ago. I still use vim. No good reason why. I love them both. 
450," **tl;dr:** I fucked up. I ruined Thanksgiving. Im sorry. I wont do it again. We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.

Hi All,

I am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.

The United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.

Many of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).

I spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.

While many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.

More than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.

However, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.

Historically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:

* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.
Posts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.

* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the lineup to an outright ban.

Again, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.

Steve

PS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users. You can modify the filters by [visiting r/all on the desktop web](https://g.redditmedia.com/34sCU-v1SO7xXrFliAOHfMR2bVjuoC2xYPV3OnH6C9Y.gif?w=1024 fm=mp4 mp4-fragmented=false s=c4127836f34b00ac6a66b1b429e02440) (Im old, sorry), but it will affect all platforms, including our native apps on iOS and Android.
 "
451," I started Reddit with my college roommate of four years, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), immediately after graduation in 2005. Not having a big vision for the company, we more or less went with the flow, building whatever we felt like each day. As a result, when an opportunity to sell came along, we took it, selling to Cond Nast in 2006. We had little expectations for the company, so it seemed at the time like we were getting away with something.

Alexis and I stayed with Reddit, under contract with CN, through 2009. I left because I wanted to try something else. I started Hipmunk in 2010 with another buddy, Adam Goldstein. He was the CEO and I was the CTO. I worked on Hipmunk for the next five years, learning many important lessons and unlearned many bad habits I had developed at Reddit. Meanwhile, Reddit continued to grow, eventually spinning out from Conde in 2012, and raising more money towards the end of 2014.

Reddit went through some hard times (yadda yadda yadda...), and in July of 2015, I returned as CEO. "
452, Ah-hem. I did most of the debugging. 
453," We only needed so many communities for testing, but thank you for volunteering.

u/powerlanguage, u/Eabryt just wants to help! "
454," Yes, actually. It's mostly exaggerated and largely ineffective, but people do try. "
455,  Reddit   
456," We've been working on it steadily for the last year, but it's not something we talk specifics about. We will continue to make progress. "
457, He's basking in glory right next to me. You all have made his day. 
458, There are a variety of reasons: to make better recommendations; to improve popularity algorithms; to know what is actually popular on Reddit. 
459," Yes. We have a brand new team dedicated to this. It's called Content Relevance, and you should start seeing the results of their work over the next couple of months. "
460," I wrote half this feature, actually, and ran out of time. We will finish it. "
461," The better question is, do I ever sit on the toilet and not browse Reddit? And the answer is no. "
462, Briefs as a kid. Boxers through college. Boxer briefs when I was tired of wedgies. 
463, Whiskey soda. 
464," Mostly we quarantine them. If they really start overstepping their bounds, we ban them. "
465, They'll see this. And probably give you gold. 
466, No. 
467," Absolutely not. We believe you should be free to express all the different facets of yourself on Reddit, and sometimes an alt is the best way to do that. "
468, This might be the only patch I'm qualified to still make at Reddit. I'll check it out when I have a chance. 
469, Who wants to deal with 100 Redditors? 
470," Funny question, but I do have an opinion on this. I've been using [Degree](https://www.amazon.com/Degree-Protection-Antiperspirant-Cool-Rush/dp/B00UB75J58/ref=sr_1_3_s_it?ie=UTF8 qid=1477517704 sr=1-3 keywords=degree) for years and swear by it. The other stuff I used made my armpits burn hella bad. "
471," Red is Admin, and blue is OP. I generally don't mark shitposting as red. "
472, You must be referring to Andy. We ~~are holding him hostage~~ hired him because ~~we need RES~~ he's awesome. 
473, You're not asking the right question. Is u/subject4807 even a person? 
474, Really Soon 
475," First, no one else wanted the job. Second, it is my dream job. So, that makes a nice match. "
476, Just desktop for the time being. 
477, I think we might just turn the site off. 
478," Your interests are your interests...

But actually, interest targeting specifically does not include sexuality. "
479, [Hope to hear from you!](https://www.reddit.com/jobs) 
480, Of course we're not. 
481, [Yep](https://i.redd.it/a7xmc3frn52x.gif) 
482," Yes! Even though we've reduced spam by about 90% the last couple of quarters, it's still an ongoing battle. Please report any spam that you see.

e: thanks for the reports, assholes. "
483, You are in the prestigious 1% of users seeing this test. Congratulations! 
484," Yes, those issues are being worked on. m.reddit.com was stagnant for a while while we finished up the new version, but now we're cruising again. "
485, Azeroth. WoW is a DDOS attack on human productivity. 
486, On Reddit. 
487, Thank you! 
488, Hotdogs. 
489," We're not doing this on mobile just yet, nor are we putting ads in third party clients. If we come to that point, yes, we'll provide an opt-out anywhere this tech is used. "
490, Reddit search might work by then. 
491, Parents and therapy.

494," Dearest Redditors,

We have been hard at work the past few months adding features, improving our ads business, and protecting users. Here is some of the stuff we have been up to:

Hopefully you did not notice, but as of last week, the m.reddit.com is powered by an entirely new tech platform. We call it 2X. In addition to load times being significantly faster for users (by about 2x) development is also much quicker. This means faster iteration and more improvements going forward. Our recently released [AMP site](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/53q42z/read_reddit_faster_via_google_with_amp/) and moderator mail are already running on 2X.

Speaking of modmail, the beta we [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) a couple months ago is going well. Thirty communities volunteered to help us iron out the kinks (thank you, r/DIY!). The community [feedback](http://reddit.com/r/modmailbeta) has been invaluable, and we are incorporating as much as we can in preparation for the general release, which we expect to be sometime next month.

Prepare your pitchforks: we are enabling basic interest targeting in our advertising product. This will allow advertisers to target audiences based on a handful of predefined interests (e.g. sports, gaming, music, etc.), which will be informed by which communities they frequent. A targeted ad is more relevant to users and more valuable to advertisers. We describe this functionality in our [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy/) and have added a permanent link to this [opt-out page](https://www.reddit.com/adsprefs). The main changes are in 'Advertising and Analytics. The opt-out is per-browser, so it should work for both logged in and logged out users.

We have a cool community feature in the works as well. Improved [spoiler tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/59jkbq/reddit_change_spoiler_tags_beta/) went into beta earlier today. Communities have long been using tricks with NSFW tags to hide spoilers, which is clever, but also results in side-effects like actual NSFW content everywhere just because you want to discuss the latest episode of The Walking Dead.

We did have some fun with Atlantic Recording Corporation in the last couple of months.  After a user posted a link to a leaked Twenty One Pilots song from the Suicide Squad soundtrack, Atlantic petitioned a NY court to order us to turn over all information related to the user and any users with the same IP address. We pushed back on the request, and our lawyer, who knows how to turn a phrase, opposed the petition by arguing, ""Because Atlantic seeks to use pre-action discovery as an impermissible fishing expedition to determine if it has a plausible claim for breach of contract or breach of fiduciary duty against the Reddit user and not as a means to match an existing, meritorious claim to an individual, its petition for pre-action discovery should be denied."" After seeing our opposition and arguing its case in front of a NY judge, Atlantic withdrew its petition entirely, signaling our victory. While pushing back on these requests requires time and money on our end, we believe it is important for us to ensure applicable legal standards are met before we disclose user information.

Lastly, we are celebrating the kick-off of our eighth annual Secret Santa exchange next Tuesday on Reddit Gifts! It is true Reddit tradition, often filled with great gifts and surprises. If you have never participated, now is the perfect time to [create an account](https://www.redditgifts.com/profiles/signup/). It will be a fantastic event this year.

I will be hanging around to answer questions about this or anything else for the next hour or so.

Steve

u: I'm out for now. Will check back later. Thanks! "
495," Yo! No question, but whenever I absolutely need to get people get up and dance, I put on GRiZ. My friends role their eyes at me by this point... but then they get up and dance. You're responsible for a lot of fun times. Thanks! "
496," I am sad to share that u/deimorz is leaving Reddit (just the company, not the site, hopefully). Chad joined us back in 2013 when the company was only about ten people. He is the author of AutoModerator, which enabled Reddit to grow to its current size, and he is the creator of r/SubredditSimulator, which will ensure our survival after you are all gone. If you have spent any time in r/bugs, r/help, r/ModSupport, r/AutoModerator, r/modhelp, r/redditdev, r/Games, r/TheoryOfReddit, and many others, you have probably met Chad and have likely been helped by him.

Chad, Reddit would not be what it is today without you, and we will miss you dearly. Best of luck out there! "
497, The new mod mail should work well on mobile. The rest of the tools will follow. 
498," Yes. r/all is literally NSFW for me now. We need to make a distinction between NSFW, porn, and spoilers. "
499, I think one could say they've been working with us a long time. 
500,  
501,"  My biggest criticism: can we have an option to make the buttons on comments bigger or easier to tap?

Yes, this gets me too. "
502, Thank you! The team will be happy to hear this. 
503, Bingo. 
504,"  Does this include what we use automoderator to remove daily?

No, we're counting actual moderator actions presently. The two are probably correlated, but I don't know off the top of my head. The ultimate goal is to save moderator time. "
505," I get a lot of love too, so it all works out. Thank you. "
506, Soon 
507," All in due time. The majority of our traffic is mobile (and growing), and we don't have any product baggage there, so that's where our attention is. Updating desktop requires a transition plan for CSS, RES, and lots of user habits. I am chomping at the bit, though. "
508," Yes. The m.reddit.com domain will go away, and we'll use www.reddit.com for both, relying on browsers / user preferences to show the correct site. "
509," Yes, we will continue to allow third party apps. "
510," It means more turnover. Check Reddit in the morning, couple hours later, check it again: fresh content. "
511, \o/ 
512," Yes, many improvements on the way. "
513," It's very much on our minds, but if there was a simple solution, we'd have done it by now. "
514," In some places, yes. In others, it's shiny and new. We're making steady progress cleaning things up. "
515," It's the engineering team that focuses spam, abuse, and cheating. "
516, We'll do our best. 
517," To get rid of the new page, we can show new links on a few people's frontpage to see if they're any good. Everyone will be drafted into the Knights of New. "
518," We're aware of it, but can't comment at the moment. "
519, Second time I've heard this today. We will investigate. 
520, The short-term goal is to find communities that reflect the best of Reddit and include them in some onboarding experiments we are running. We don't want to include people against their will or cause harm to communities. Happy to chat further once this AMA dies down. 
521," I can't commit to this specifically right this moment, but in general, we want to show ads that users engage with, not ads that get crushed. It's better for everyone that way. Believe it or not, some advertisers actually take time to embrace Reddit and get rewarded for it. "
522, Roger. Will report that as a bug. 
523, Thank you 
524," A lot of this is still in the air, but the general idea is somewhere in between the current frontpage, which is set by us, and r/all, which is pretty much everything. Onboarding is a separate development effort, but will play a big role in this. We will likely have improved onboarding  before we have a new frontpage. "
525, The new version is a lot faster and quicker to develop on. It's our new web stack. New mod mail is built on this stack as well. 
526, https://i.redd.it/a7xmc3frn52x.gif 
527, Maybe if you had better titles you wouldn't get downvoted to oblivion on all your posts. Or maybe it's because you are relentlessly trying to turn Reddit into Digg. 
528, Doesn't matter. You clicked. 
529, Uhhhh... great! 
530," I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted.

On the product side, weve been busy. Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and were proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that were testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.

Weve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems wed like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. Were still in the early days, but Im happy were dedicating resources to it.

As it relates to monetization, weve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests well be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we dont want to compromise whats brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.

Yesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and were excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. Well be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.

Weve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust   Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, weve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. Weve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.

Happy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.

e: grammar

u: Thank you! Heading out for now. Will check back later. "
531," It's not practical to enforce such a rule. There are plenty of business on Reddit representing themselves legitimately, and there are plenty who masquerade as organic users. I think it's wiser to incentivize businesses to be transparent about it.  "
532, Thanks for the feedback. We reverted the sticky behavior a little while ago. 
533,"  Do you feel that redditors are increasingly quick to jump to conspiracy theory conclusions when any change is made? 

Quick? Yes. Increasingly? I'd say they've always been pretty quick. "
534, It only affects Hot. 
535," Agreed.

 Many of us slack at work and browse reddit

At least I can claim it's work. "
536," Sort of, but r/all is sorted based on absolute hotness, which means a post in r/funny that has 10k upvotes and 5k downvotes will be ranked higher than a post in r/sewerhorse that has 30 upvotes and no downvotes. "
537,"  Can you expand on what you mean by 'having less evil?'

We've made a lot of progress fighting spam, Account Take Overs (ATOs), and reported abuse over the past few months. "
538, Our changes are community agnostic. 
539," It was a problem. A smaller problem, but still a problem. As I mentioned in my post, r/all has gone through waves of being overwhelmed by a specific community many, many times over the years. Sometimes it's healthy, sometimes it's funny, most of the time it's annoying, particularly during election years. "
540," You'll see fewer powers from the same community. This is one of those cases where we might be throwing out some of the good with the bad. We'll keep a watch during major events and see how it feels. I don't believe r/all or our current front page is the best solution for Reddit, but it's the best we have right now. "
541," So, that's approximately how the current front page works. We normalize the scores and sort by the most outstanding. It's limited to defaults / subscriptions, though.

You basically describe the new frontpage algorithm I've been fantasizing about. We started work on this, in fact, but we re-allocated that brainpower (u/KeyserSosa) to focus on anti-evil for a while. We have since hired more brainpower and have less evil, so I'm hopeful we can get back to it soon. "
542," Game day threads should still work if they are self posts, which most are, by the way. "
543," It's just for the specific rendering of the r/all listing. So, it'll affect all communities with r/all itself, but not on the listings for the actual communities. Not sure if I'm answering the question you're asking... "
544," No news to share, but it's very much on my mind. I'd really like communities to come and go organically. Right now, we (Reddit Inc), do the choosing, and I don't like playing kingmaker.

We have communities that come and go quickly (around major world events); rise and fall over the course of months (r/nba, r/gameofthrones); and communities that stay popular for years and years (r/iama, r/AskReddit). We'd like to be able to account for all of these situations. "
545," Thanks for the feedback. We're still thinking about stickies, and will likely make more changes. In the meantime, sorry we upset your usage of it. "
546," Yes, we'll expose filtering to everyone in the near future.

In your mind, what's the difference between filtering and blocking? "
547," As a moderator of r/circlejerk, I resent that. "
548, Found them. Thank you. 
549," Hi All,

A few days ago, we talked about a few technological and process changes we would be working on in order to improve your Reddit experience and ensure access to timely information is available.

Over the last day we rolled out a behavior change to r/all. The r/all listing gives us a glimpse into what is happening on all of Reddit independent of specific interests or subscriptions. In many ways, r/all is a reflection of what is happening online in general. It is culturally important and drives many conversations around the world.

The changes we are making are to preserve this aspect of r/allour specific goal being to prevent any one community from dominating the listing. The algorithm change is fairly simpleas a community is represented more and more often in the listing, the hotness of its posts will be increasingly lessened. This results in more variety in r/all.

Many people will ask if this is related to r/the_donald. The short answer is no, we have been working on this change for a while, but I cannot deny their behavior hastened its deployment. We have seen many communities like r/the_donald over the yearsones that attempt to dominate the conversation on Reddit at the expense of everyone else. This undermines Reddit, and we are not going to allow it. 

Interestingly enough, r/the_donald was already getting downvoted out of r/all yesterday morning before we made any changes. It seems the rest of the Reddit community had had enough. Ironically, r/EnoughTrumpSpam was hit harder than any other community when we rolled out the changes. Thats Reddit for you. \\\_()_/ 

As always, we will keep an eye out for any unintended side-effects and make changes as necessary. Community has always been one of the very best things about Redditlets remember that. Thank you for reading, thank you for Reddit-ing, lets all get back to connecting with our fellow humans, sharing ferret gifs, and making the Reddit the most fun, authentic place online.

Steve

u: I'm off for now. Thanks for the feedback! I'll check back in a couple hours. "
550," Honestly, I'm quite upset myself. As a user, I was disappointed that when I wanted to learn what happened in Orlando, and I found a lot of infighting bullshit. We're still getting to the bottom of it all. Fortunately, the [AskReddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4nqnrm/breaking_news_orlando_nightclub_massshooting/) was quite good.

All of us at Reddit are committed to making sure this doesn't happen again, and we're working with the mods to do so. We have historically stayed hands off and let these situations develop, but in this case we should have stepped in. Next time we will get involved sooner to make sure things don't go off the rails.


 "
551, Removed the mod-only rule. Thanks for the feedback. 
552, I'd say it's going exactly as expected. 
553," I'm not a fan of defaults in general. They made sense at the time, but we've outgrown them. They create a few problems, the most important of which is that new communities can't grow into popularity. They also assume a one-size-fits all editorial approach, and we can do better now. "
554,"  What if stickied posts just didn't show up in /r/all?

We don't want to ruin game and episode threads. "
555," My understanding is it was a new account from an old mod. His original account is also gone. He stepped down about a year ago when he got a new job, and returned a few months ago. "
556," These are good points. We're hearing the feedback and will discuss.

edit: we removed the moderator rule. "
557," Agreed. We haven't invested in the technology in a while, but even in its current state, they're very useful for these big events, and I regret not promoting one in this case. "
558, It's totally inappropriate and that person is no longer a mod. 
559, We of course reserve our right to use our discretion in these situations. There will always be exceptional situations. 
560, Their response is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4nsiw1/state_of_the_subreddit_and_the_orlando_shooting/). 
561, There's no policy against this beyond our existing [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). 
562," Hi All,

What happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Lets remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.

I would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.

The story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.

Whether you agree with r/news policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.

We are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. WeReddit Inc, moderators, and usersall have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.

In the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:

* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.
* [Were introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): Theyll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.
* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.
* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.

Again, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. Weve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time.  "
563, https://i.redd.it/a7xmc3frn52x.gif 
564, This is the beginning of the end. Maybe it's the end of the end. Whatever. I'm going back to Digg. 
565, I wanted to have as few values as possible so their impact is greater. We felt that both Remember the Human and What Would Snoo Do? encompass the ideas of respect and privacy. 
566,"  When will m.reddit.com be not horrible and useless

5pm pst. Mark my words. "
567," This is a tricky one. The problems we see are a result of a couple of decisions we made a long time ago, not understanding their longterm consequences: simplistic moderator hierarchy and valuable real-estate in r/ urls. Unwinding these decisions requires a lot of thought and finesse. Reddit wouldn't exist as it does today without the good moderators, and we need to be very careful to continue to empower them while filtering out the bad actors. I'd like to be more specificour thinking is more specificbut we're not ready to share anything just yet. "
568," I understand the motive for creating them in the first place, to ensure variety on the front page, but I think we would take a different approach now. "
569," 1. People can be their authentic selves in a way they can't anywhere else. They can also be someone else's authentic self.

2. Batman. He's the world's greatest detective. "
570," I don't know, I use [1password](https://1password.com/), and you should too. "
571," It's hard to answer that. There are many moments that I regretted at one point (selling Reddit so early, leaving Reddit, letting my marriage fail), but that I now look back on with perspective, and those experiences have shaped me for the better. "
572, Please remember to distinguish comments written in official company capacity. 
573, Yes yes yes. Our biggest high-level product need to is to educate new users on what Reddit actually is. 
574," Yes and no. We spent a lot of the last year healing and hiring. I have to remind myself that we can't do everything we want overnight. At the same time, I'm really excited to build all our dreams, and I want to get things online yesterday! "
575," Yes, actually. There are probably users who were accidentally banned for spamming, but in reality they were just sharing an IP with a spammer. Now that our anti-spam efforts are so much better, I'd like to unban all old spammers and see what happens. "
576," We [announced](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ldk0r/reddit_change_affiliate_links_on_reddit/) this last week. We haven't enabled it yet, and we will provide an opt-out. We're starting with a test to see what the opportunity size actually is. We're also treading carefully. "
577, We'll do everything we can to ensure that that is the case. 
578, Troll. 
579," Not really, but I try to be a good sport. "
580," Not a lot new, but I can repeat how we feel: privacy colors many of our conversations around here. We have a good [privacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3tlcil/we_are_updating_our_privacy_policy_effective_jan); we released a thorough [transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015), which will be even more thorough next year because we're keeping better records; and that whole techno-libertarian, super-paranoid viewpoint that exists on Reddit? That came from me, and has been upheld by many others around here over the years.

edit: I have a hard time with links. "
581," The best practice is one-time-use passwords, I believe. "
582, Never. But how often do I do AMAs while on the toilet? Now that's a question worth asking. 
583," Yes, but we throw away IPs after 100 days.

 Can you see the main account of a throwaway?

Sort of. No one's looking. If they happen to share an IP, it's possible, but many IPs, for example at a college, have many hundreds of accounts on them.

edit: I should clarify. There is no such thing as a ""super mod,"" and only select Reddit employees have access to IPs.

 "
584," We would like to make better use of all the data we have. The front page could be a lot more relevant; we can make better content suggestions; and yes, ads can be better targeted. There are many opportunities to make Reddit better and more relevant.

We're not actually doing it now. I've mentioned this sort of thing before. When do, we'll always provide an opt-out or way of resetting things.

No, we'll don't ever share this sort of information directly with advertisers. We sometimes have to jump through a lot of hoops to accomplish this, but we don't mind at all. "
585," I love posts like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/4jqvlf/reorganizing_the_subreddit/) that I couldn't possibly explain to anyone else, but still make me laugh til I cry. "
586," We're still working through the acute pain of fixing and finding the actually compromised accounts. 2fa after that. We've talked through the technical challenges, and they're not that bad. "
587," Thought of, yes. In reality, probably not. We do appreciate everything they do for us, however. I don't use it myself because I believe I should have to suffer until we make things better. "
588,"  Is a hotdog a sandwhich? What about a taco?

No. Stop it. A hotdog is one piece of bread. A taco is one piece of something. A sandwich needs 2+ pieces of bread.

 Sharks or Penguins?

Redwings

 Warriors or Cavs?

Dubs! "
589," The sentiment I was trying to convey is that people share many different facets of their personalities on Reddit, which doesn't happen many other places online or even in real life sometimes. 

As it happens, the quote you're referring to was tongue-in-cheek and needlessly douchey. My bad. "
590," The best part is being a part of something so important to so many people. It's a lot of fun most of the time, and even when it's not fun, it's very exciting and challenging. It's not always easy to find that in a job, and I'm really fortunate to have it in mine.

The hardest part is watching what I say publicly. Everything is recorded and judged. Our PR team is always lecturing me to be a little less Joe Biden. "
591," The big one is new moderator mail. We've got a whole product team on it. The short answer is, as soon as it's readyas soon as possible. "
592, That was before my time. 
593, reddit.com 
594," No, nor do I like getting caught in the rain. "
595," Hi All,

We havent done one of these in a little while, and I thought it would be a good time to catch up.

Weve launched a [bunch of stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog) recently, and were hard at work on lots more: m.reddit.com improvements, the next versions of Reddit for iOS and Android, moderator mail, relevancy experiments (lots of [little tests](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4jzit9/reddit_change_several_small_tests_to_improve_user/) to improve experience), account take-over prevention, technology improvements so we can move faster, andof coursehiring.

Ive got a couple hours, so, ask me anything!

Steve

edit: Thanks for the questions! I'm stepping away for a bit. I'll check back later. "

597, They make a compelling argument. 
598," Some will, yes, and we'll introduce them in time as they ramp up. "
599," Today we are excited to announce that [Philippe Beaudette](https://www.reddit.com/u/AchievementUnlockd) has joined us to lead our Community team. He comes from Wikipedia by way of Wikia. At the Wikimedia Foundation (which hosts and supports Wikipedia, among other sites) he was responsible for the team that did community management, user trust and safety, and strategic change management, guiding the community through a time of immense growth and maturation. He spent almost 7 years there, as one of their first community hires, and managed to have his fingers on a huge number of projects, from fundraising (raising money from nearly every country in the world and accepting Wikipedias first donation from Antarctica) to community governance and their international elections processeswhile dealing with communities working in almost 200 different languages.  Hes particularly proud to have led their community interactions around a worldwide [24 hour site shut-down](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/17/wikipedia-blackout_n_1212096.html?slideshow=true) to drive awareness of the SOPA bill two years ago, an effort that Reddit also joined.

After leaving Wikipedia, Philippe joined Wikia and ran the Community Support and Engagement team there, supporting Wikias 350,000 fan-created communities. We are honored to have him on our team. Please welcome Philippe!

In addition to Philippe, we have brought on an additional five members to the Community and Trust and Safety teams this week. See if you can collect them all! "
600," I am sad to share that u/krispykrackers is leaving Reddit. Over the past five years, she has done an incredible amount of work for us and the Reddit community. She has been the face of our Community team at Reddit; helped us write many of our policies and was indispensable working through countless tricky situations; and she lead our efforts in support of Extra Life, raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for Childrens Miracle Network Hospitals. She has been a friend to me and many others here. While we are sad to see her go, we wish her the best going forward.

Actually replacing Kristine is impossible, but next Monday, four (maybe five!) new members of our Community and Trust and Safety teams will be starting, which will give the team even more horsepower. "
601," There are definite advantages, but presently we want people in our main offices, which are in SF, NYC, and LA. This may change in the future, but the majority of our company is new, and I want to the culture to strengthen before we consider spreading out. "
602,"  Have you considered enabling some sort of 2FA system to help deal with this issue?

Yes, we will add that in time, but it doesn't solve the acute problem. Many of the compromised accounts are old / inactive / owned by users who have shitty passwords. "
603," We have a goal, but I'm not sharing it lest we miss it, and you all [take your disappointment out on me](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-06/15/5/enhanced/webdr06/anigif_enhanced-19641-1434361510-6.gif). "
604," Hi All,

I want to give you all an update with the things that are keeping us busy, and hopefully as a result, making you less busy:

* **Spam**: Last quarter we saw a huge increase in spam, including a handful of heavy attacks. We diverted resources to combat this, and we have made quite a bit of progress, lowering user reported spam by over 60% from its high point last quarter. We still have plenty of work to do, but we are making steady progress. Removing as spam or reporting as such are still the most effective ways to help.

* **Account Take-Overs** (ATOs): In response to our improved spam-fighting measures, the bad-guys have been targeting existing accounts, compromising them for the purpose of spamming and vote cheating. We are fighting ATOs on the engineering side, but ATOs also create a burden on our community team to notify affected users, send password reset emails, etc. We are working on automating the notification and recovery processes to free up our community managers. The root cause of the issue is poor passwords. Please use strong and unique passwords.

* **Support Backlog**: Because of the aforementioned issues, our community team is swamped with support tickets. We are doing a good job keeping up with the incoming flow, but we do have a backlog that is taking time to work through. We are sorry for any delays. The good news is we have a number of new people joining the team over the next few weeks that will help.

* **Modmail**: I am happy to report that we finally have a team dedicated to working on a new system for moderator mail. To this point, we have tried a number of approaches and have had a handful of false starts, but we have not made the sort of progress we would like. The current system is a series of hacks built on an old code base, and because of this, we have decided to build modmail as a new, separate system. This will allow us to develop it without disrupting your current workflows. We know this is where you spend a lot of your time, and we are working hard to make it more effective.

We appreciate all you do for Reddit as moderators, and we appreciate seeing the questions you ask in this community. We are particularly thankful for those of you who jump in and help the other moderators here and elsewhere.

 The Reddit Team "
605, You can tap and hold and move it around. 
606," That was our first approach, in fact, but we found we could set ourselves up to move faster down the road with a new codebase.

You can enable NSFW in the preferences. "
607,"  Please bring back the gesture shortcuts like swiping left on a comment to collapse the whole thread, or two-finger-tap to upvote!

Instead of swipe to collapse, there is a little button in the lower right to skip to the next thread. You can move it around with press-and-hold. Swipe to collapse was my favorite feature ever, and I think this button is a nice improvement.

 Switching to Compact view appears to work for individual subreddits, but my front page is still in Card view?

There is a global preference for compact view as well.
 "
608," Every app is featureless compared to AlienBlue. Seriously, I learned about new hidden features just this morning.

This is just version 1! More to come. "
609," In India, you're right our phrasing could be better, and we'll take into account for our next report.  The ""What was affected"" means that the 11 requests related to 8 posts and 1 user account (there were 3 requests related to that 1 user account).  "
610," The behavior is different when someone explicitly deletes a comment (we don't show it) versus deleting their account (we don't show the account name on the comment).

update to answer some questions:

When a user deletes a comment, we keep the body of the comment, but we don't display it anywhere. The reason was it simplified the implementation at the time. That's not a sacred horse, and it's something we can reconsider. In the context of this conversation, I don't believe we've ever turned over deleted comments (I don't think anyone has asked, either).

If you modify a comment, we don't keep previous versions.

 "
611," We never willingly hand over information. I don't know this specific case off the top of my head, but I will ask.

update: updated the my first reply above with more context. "
612, I've been advised not to say anything one way or the other. 
613, (-_-) 
614," My understanding is we can delete whatever we want, unless we receive a ""preservation request.""

We keep the deleted comments in an attempt to preserve the continuity of conversation. It's purely a product decision. "
615," To third parties? Never that I can recall.

But, if we believe you're a spammer, yes, we'll read your PMs (PM spam is very common). If you make a threat of violence (e.g. suicide or bomb threat), we will investigate to see if there's something we should do. The latter situation is relatively rare. "
616," Even with the canaries, we're treading a fine line. The whole thing is icky, which is why we [joined Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf) in pushing back. "
617," Our [law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines) document how we can be legally compelled to share information.

Our general strategy is to store as little as possible to minimize our surface area. I also encourage users to share as little as possible for the same reason. "
618, Send us a request for information and see for yourself! 
619," ~~We didn't receive any in 2014, I believe.~~ We received 5 in 2014, but didn't disclose any information. In 2015, we complied with one non-emergency foreign request from Canada because we ended up receiving a subpoena from the US Department of Homeland Security as well. The other foreign requests were emergency requests.

An emergency request is something like a suicide or bomb threat.

update: clarified the foreign requests. "
620, Fastest pun in the West. 
621," In 2014, we published our first Transparency Report, which can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2014). We made a commitment to you to publish an annual report, detailing government and law enforcement agency requests for private information about our users. In keeping with that promise, weve published our [2015 transparency report](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/transparency/2015). 

We hope that sharing this information will help you better understand our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy) and demonstrate our commitment for Reddit to remain a place that actively encourages authentic conversation.

Our goal is to provide information about the number and types of requests for user account information and removal of content that we receive, and how often we are legally required to respond. This isnt easy as a small company as we dont always have the tools we need to accurately track the large volume of requests we receive. We will continue, when legally possible, to inform users before sharing user account information in response to these requests.

In 2015, we did not produce records in response to 40% of government requests, and we did not remove content in response to 79% of government requests.

In 2016, weve taken further steps to protect the privacy of our users. We joined our industry peers in an amicus brief [supporting Twitter](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/3/3d/Twitter_versus_Lynch_Amicus_Brief_February_2016.pdf), detailing our desire to be honest about the national security requests for removal of content and the disclosure of user account information.

In addition, we joined an amicus brief [supporting Apple](http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/Airbnb_Atlassian_Automattic_CloudFlare_eBay_GitHub_Kickstarter_LinkedIn_Mapbox_Medium_Meetup_Reddit_Square_Squarespace_Twilio_Twitter_and_Wickr.pdf) in their fight against the government's attempt to force a private company to work on behalf of them. While the government asked the court to [vacate the court order](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/03/28/technology/document-us-filing-dropping-apple-case.html) compelling Apple to assist them, we felt it was important to stand with Apple and speak out against this unprecedented move by the government, which threatens the relationship of trust between a platforms and its users, in addition to jeopardizing your privacy. 

We are also excited to announce the launch of our [external law enforcement guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/law_enforcement_guidelines). Beyond clarifying how Reddit works as a platform and briefly outlining how both federal and state law enforcements can compel Reddit to turn over user information, we believe they make very clear that we adhere to strict standards. 

We know the success of Reddit is made possible by your trust. We hope this transparency report strengthens that trust, and is a signal to you that we care deeply about your privacy.

(I'll do my best to answer questions, but as with all legal matters, I can't always be completely candid.)

edit: I'm off for now. There are a few questions that I'll try to answer after I get clarification.
 "
622," We're mostly heads-down working through a deep backlog of tickets, and I'm sorry for the slow responses lately. These issues are frustrating for us as well. We know we can do better. "
623," Please PM the details, and I will investigate.

edit: I think I figured it out. Sorry for the delay. Let me know if you have more trouble with him/them. "
624," I hear that you're frustrated, and I am as well. Please PM the details, and I will investigate. "
625," PM me the info, and I'll take a look.

edit: looks like we got to it a couple of days ago before I saw this. "
626," Right now, it's just in a test for a small sample of users. It's something we could consider, but we would do that in the context of considering the privacy implications as well. "
627," Yes, were testing this.  The first thing we wanted to learn is what users click on globally (i.e. what our our most popular domains are. We have learned this. Ill give you one guess). Were only sampling over a small number of users. Down the road wed like to use this information this data to make recommendations, fight spam, make better sorting algorithms, and improve the front page (e.g. not show you the same links over and over). The information isnt being used on an individual basis, and before it is, well give you a way to clear your history. "
628," ""Soon"" as in, ""daylight savings is coming up soon"" as opposed to ""the sun is going to explode soon."" "
629," It's right around the corner. I saw a demo the other day. We've got a few loose ends to wrap up, but we're trying to move quickly on this spam stuff.

edit: (3/4/2016) It's up for suspicious users and in a test for all users. "
630," I've been pushing a strategy change to build modmail as a separate app on our api. Building things in our current desktop codebase is painfully slow because of all the tech debt.

That was the same reasoning for the modmail - email experiment, which didn't work out that way I had hoped. (It's not completely dead, though. We're going to use it internally and iterate). "
631," We had a board meeting yesterday, so I'm catching up on a few days of email. My two big priorities are hiring engineers and instilling a greater sense of urgency to get things done. "
632," Ironically, this post was also banned. Someone else can probably chime in with the exact cause. "
633," When we deployed the site to production the first time, I submitted http://yahoo.com over and over to test it. Back then I used to develop against the production machines as well :-/ "
634," Fun fact: this was one of [the first posts ever](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/2439/flash_how_to_fold_a_shirt/). I think this is the original, but maybe I found one of the first reposts ever. I recall this being the first and only Reddit link I showed my grandma.

I've been folding shirts this way for over 10 years as a result. "
635, fixed 
636," I didn't know about night mode in AB until a few months ago, and I now find it indispensable. Worry not. "
637," Yes, he's still with us. He's in Australia, and has limited availability, but he's working on the next AB release as we speak. Like I said, we think the world of him, and we'll take as much as we can get. "
638," I can't overstate how excited I am about this. I've been an Alien Blue user for many yearsit's where I do 90% of my reddittingand u/jase (the author) is a genius. That said, the new app is looking dope. The new iOS team is FLYING. I can't wait for it to be in the hands of users (including me). "
639, Sure. 
640, It's basic economics: the rich get richer. 
641," On mobile, I believe the plan is to put them on the submission page. "
642," Ok, thanks for the feedback. We can do better. I will investigate. "
643," 3 of the top 10 posts in r/ModSupport are from us. I'm sorry we don't get to every question, but we're absolutely in there. We are very aware of the spam issues.

 I don't think I've heard a peep around what's going on with the anti-brigading tools.

You won't really. We've improved here, and we're continuing to invest in it, but anti-brigading is something we do quietly so the bad guys don't know what's working.

 A year ago, reddit hired a ""Community Engineer"" to rebuild modmail. There are literally no signs of progress on this.

I'm sad to say that although we invested quite a bit, my favorite feature [didn't work out](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/42o57u/modmailtoemail_beta_closing/). I had thought by forwarding mail out of Reddit we could do an end-run around the problem. I was trying to avoid a wholesale rewrite of the system because that will take forever with our current resources. We're not doing nothing, but we haven't succeeded either. We're still on it.

 AlienBlue was taken over by reddit recently and seems to be dead in the water.

We bought it years ago, actually, and have put out a number of releases in the past few months, [at least five](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue). We are working on a new iOS app as we speak, and that will be the future for us, but we're continuing to maintain AB during the meantime.

 "
644," We added the [account suspension](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/) tool just for this purpose. Instead of shadowbanning, a user will be put in timeout with an explanation. "
645, I'm not sure if Reddit is ready for cats. You can try. Maybe it'll take hold this time. 
646," The accusations of brigading we have investigated many times, and the data just doesn't support the claims.

If you're being personally harassed, please report the users by clicking the report button and reporting them to r/reddit.com modmail. "
647,"  Will this come back into the pipeline at some point this year?

Very likely. As you said, we put it on the back burner because we had more acute pains to deal with. One of our big company goals this year is to increase engagement, and a great way of doing this is to convert our casual users into redditors, which requires education.

At this very moment, however, we're working on a few other things. Mobile is getting a lot of attention. That's where the users are going, whether we are prepared or not. The A/B testing system is critically important as well. This allows us to see if changes (e.g. to onboarding) are actually having the intended effect. "
648," I'd love to, but honestly, my best idea is to instead focus on making new community growth easier. If users can revolt into a new community successfully, the mod hierarchy doesn't matter as much. When I refer to ""front page algorithm"" it's code for ""fix the default mess."" "
649," Are you referring to the AMA book? That was a project started quite a while ago with the r/IAMA mods with the aim of making something physical and beautiful to show off in the real world. Proceeds from the book are going to charity, but we're still working with the charity on terms (yes, that's a thing we have to do).

But if you think our best revenue idea is *making a book*, I'm a little insulted. I mean, I know we have a lot to improve on, but we'd at least sell your personal data to advertisers before getting into publishing for profit. "
650," I would say 99% of mods are great, but yes, there are some bad actors. We take the stance that the moderators can run their communities how they'd like, even if we'd do it differently in some cases.

Making it easier for new communities to grow will put more accountability on the established communities. When I refer to the front page algorithm work, this will be one of the side effects. "
651,"  It does seem like the Reddit community has become more bitter and divided

I believe that's a side effect of our community broadening. As I mentioned elsewhere,  improving the front page algorithm and addressing the default situation will go a long way. We're seeing the effects of a bunch of people who have wildly differing viewpoints crammed into a small room.

My dear friend, first Reddit employee, and smartest guy on the planet, u/KeyserSosa, is hard at work on the problem.

(Sorry for calling you out, Chris) "
652," Our position is still that shadowbanning shouldn't be used on real users. It's useful for spammers, but that's about it. That's why we released the [better banning](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3sbrro/account_suspensions_a_transparent_alternative_to/) tools a couple months ago, which allows us to put a user in timeout with an explanation. This helps correct behavior.

Moderators can still ban users from their communities, and it's not transparent. I don't like this, and I get a lot of complaints from confused users. However, the moderators don't have a ton of alternatives. [Improving reporting with more rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/42o2i0/moderators_subreddit_rules_now_available_for_all/) is a step in the right direction. It's my desire that moderators will rely on banning less and less as we build better tooling. "
653," The T S team is mandated to do two things: make sure users don't see spam, and to enforce our policies.

Spam is fairly straightforward to explain. You shouldn't see it. Reporting helps, but the real solution involves investing in more automated tools. We'll never be able to solve the problem one spammer at a time.

Their second job is to enforce the [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). The better banning feature we released a couple months ago is helpful here. Now we have the ability to actually enforce behavior without outright banning someone, which doesn't really work.

This team is [hiring](https://www.reddit.com/jobs). "
654, We're doing stuff. Be prepared. 
655," Yes, from time to time. That's the best way to actually measure if something is an improvement or not. "
656, Yes. We've got our sights on the front page algorithm in general. It can be vastly improved. I'm not a fan of defaults. It puts too much of a burden on us to be tastemakers and makes it difficult for great new communities to break through. 
657," Well, for one, we are shipping a bunch of stuff in the near future, and second, I wanted to set the stage to answer some questions since I haven't been able to do that in a while. "
658," Yes. That's what I was referring with the T S team. We basically had one small group of people trying to do everything. Going forward it'll be better to have teams focusing on specific areas. In this case, the Community team can focus on community, and the T S team can focus on spam and abuse. [We're hiring for both](http://www.reddit.com/jobs). "
659," Hey, I'm super excited about this year, that's what I was trying to convey. Android beta is out today, we've been on a hiring tear lately, and we're finally able to test changes to the site in a consistent manner. "
660," There are gray areas for sure, but there are also many cases where unacceptable behavior is clearly unacceptable. We're focusing on those first. Repeatedly hammering someone over PMs, for example, is an easy one. "
661," We don't have the bandwidth to answer every summons, but we're aware of the uptick lately. Our efforts right now are to improve in a more scalable fashion. Historically, it's been a lot of one-offs and by-hand efforts, which isn't sustainable. "
662, Yes. We're making steady progress. We've made a couple of solid new hires on that team as well. 
663," Hi All,

Now that 2015 is in the books, its a good time to reflect on where we are and where we are going. Since I returned last summer, my goal has been to bring a sense of calm; to rebuild our relationship with our users and moderators; and to improve the fundamentals of our business so that we can focus on making you (our users), those that work here, and the world in general, proud of Reddit. Reddits mission is to help people discover places where they can be themselves and to empower the community to flourish.

2015 was a big year for Reddit. First off, we cleaned up many of our external policies including our Content Policy, Privacy Policy, and API terms. We also established internal policies for managing requests from law enforcement and governments. Prior to my return, [Reddit took an industry-changing stance on involuntary pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/).

Reddit is a collection of communities, and the moderators play a critical role shepherding these communities. It is our job to help them do this. We have shipped a [number of improvements](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/new/) to these tools, and while we have a long way to go, I am happy to see steady progress.

Spam and abuse threaten Reddits communities. We created a Trust and Safety team to focus on abuse at scale, which has the added benefit of freeing up our Community team to focus on the positive aspects of our communities. We are still in transition, but you should feel the impact of the change more as we progress. We know we have a lot to do here.

I believe we have positioned ourselves to have a strong 2016. A phrase we will be using a lot around here is ""Look Forward."" Reddit has a long history, and its important to focus on the future to ensure we live up to our potential. Whether you access it from your desktop, a mobile browser, or a native app, we will work to make the Reddit product more engaging. Mobile in particular continues to be a priority for us. Our new Android app is going into beta today, and our new iOS app should follow it out soon.

We receive many requests from law enforcement and governments. We take our stewardship of your data seriously, and we know transparency is important to you, which is why we are putting together a Transparency Report. This will be available in March.

This year will see a lot of changes on Reddit. Recently we built an A/B testing system, which allows us to test changes to individual features scientifically, and we are excited to put it through its paces. Some changes will be big, others small and, inevitably, not everything will work, but all our efforts are towards making Reddit better. We are all redditors, and we are all driven to understand why Reddit works for some people, but not for others; which changes are working, and what effect they have; and to get into a rhythm of constant improvement. We appreciate your patience while we modernize Reddit.

As always, Reddit would not exist without you, our community, so thank you. We are all excited about what 2016 has in store for us.

Steve

edit: I'm off. Thanks for the feedback and questions. We've got a lot to deliver on this year, but the whole team is excited for what's in store. We've brought on a bunch of new people lately, but our biggest need is still hiring. If you're interested, please check out https://www.reddit.com/jobs. "
664," Today we are introducing standardized [API Terms of Use](/wiki/api). You, our community of developers, are important to us, and have been instrumental to the success of the Reddit platform. First and foremost, we want to reaffirm our commitment to providing (and improving!) a public API.

There are a couple of notable changes to the API terms that Id like to highlight. The first is that we are requesting all users of the API to register with us. This provides a point of contact for when we have important updates to share; provides a point of contact for when things go wrong; and helps us prevent abuse.

We are also no longer requiring a special licensing agreement to use our API for commercial purposes. We do request that you seek approval for your monetization model in the registration process.

We have added clarity about the types of things that the API is not intended fornamely applications that promote illegal activity, disrupt core Reddit functionality, or introduce security risks. But you werent doing any of these things anyway.

We still require users of our API to comply with our User Agreement, Privacy Policy, API Usage Limits, and any other applicable laws or regulations. We will continue to require the use of OAuth2.  We understand moving to OAuth2 can take time, so we are giving developers until March 17th to make this change.

We look forward to working with you more to create great experiences for our communities. There are many wonderful projects built on our API, and we would love to see even more. Thank you for all that you do.

You can contact the api@reddit.com alias to ask questions about the API service. "
665," Have some gold, friend. "
666,"  We collect information about how all visitors browse the site to make reddit better. We remove personally identifiable data from this information after 90 days.

This was a statement in the old policy I never liked because it's vague as to what is actually personally identifiable. Basically what it meant is that we delete our access logs after 90 days, which we will continue to do (but after 100 days). "
667," We're still not selling or giving access to individual user data. That is important to us, and we state in the privacy we won't do this. (""This means that Reddit does not share your individual account browsing habits with advertisers."")

We would like to allow advertisers to target on more than just communities, however. For example, targeting based on keywords will be helpfulthere is a lot gaming content on Reddit outside of communities dedicate specifically to gaming. "
668," Presently, Google, but these things come and go. One of the reasons I like DNT is a user can set it once and not worry about it. "
669, That's correct. 
670," Right, we only see what's given to us. Personal responsibility is important in all of this.

One of our responsibilities is to educate users on what control they actually have, which is quite a bit. "
671," Loving it. I get to work on challenging and meaningful things with great people.

And, if anyone would like to join us, we're hiring: https://www.reddit.com/jobs "
672, Thank you! 
673, We can't tell when you're in private mode. All we see is a user that shows up once and never comes back. 
674," We collect as little as possible to run the site; we share as little with advertisers as possible (specifically, we do not share individual browsing habits); and we want you to understand what you have control over (almost everything). "
675,"  There's no point in hashing IP addresses -- it's such a small search space, an attacker would be able to reverse the hash in hours.

Our thinking is to hash with a salt and throw away the salts periodically. For abuse, we mostly care about ""is this IP the same?""  "
676," That's always our goal. Sometimes we may be legally prohibited from doing so, or in the case of an emergency, we may delay notice. "
677," 1. Turkey, cheese, lettuce (I went through a sprouts phase, but we're all have silly things in our past), mayo

2. It's coming along! A little slower than planned, but that's software for you. "
678," The IP stuff has been an interesting challenge. The fewer we can store, the better for all of us. "
679, A lot of people around here appreciate you saying that. 
680," Of course. I like DNT. It's too bad it's not more widely supported around the web, but it fits us nicely. "
681," I always remind people, here at the mothership, many of us wear tinfoil hats, so we're generally aligned with the community on these sorts of things. "
682," Also, thank you u/orangejulius and u/courtiebabe420 for reading drafts of the Policy! "
683," In a little over a month well be updating our [Privacy Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/privacypolicy). We know this is important to you, so I want to explain what has changed and why.

Keeping control in your hands is paramount to us, and this is our first consideration any time we change our privacy policy. Our overarching principle continues to be to request as little personally identifiable information as possible. To the extent that we store such information, we do not share it generally. Where there are exceptions to this, notably when you have given us explicit consent to do so, or in response to legal requests, we will spell them out clearly.

The new policy is functionally very similar to the previous one, but its shorter, simpler, and less repetitive. We have clarified what information we collect automatically (basically anything your browser sends us) and what we share with advertisers (nothing specific to your Reddit account).

One notable change is that we are increasing the number of days we store IP addresses from 90 to 100 so we can measure usage across an entire quarter. In addition to internal analytics, the primary reason we store IPs is to fight spam and abuse. I believe in the future we will be able to accomplish this without storing IPs at all (e.g. with hashing), but we still need to work out the details.

In addition to changes to our Privacy Policy, we are also beginning to roll out support for [Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/). Do Not Track is an option you can enable in modern browsers to notify websites that you do not wish to be tracked, and websites can interpret it however they like (most ignore it). If you have Do Not Track enabled, we will not load any third-party analytics. We will keep you informed as we develop more uses for it in the future.

Individually, you have control over what information you share with us and what your browser sends to us automatically. I encourage everyone to understand how browsers and the web work and what steps you can take to protect your own privacy. Notably, browsers allow you to disable [third-party cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Third-party_cookie), and you can customize your browser with a variety of privacy-related [extensions](http://lifehacker.com/the-best-browser-extensions-that-protect-your-privacy-479408034).

We are proud that Reddit is home to many of the most open and genuine conversations online, and we know this is only made possible by your trust, without which we would not exist. We will continue to do our best to earn this trust and to respect your basic assumptions of privacy.

Thank you for reading. Ill be here for an hour to answer questions, and I'll check back in again the week of Dec 14th before the changes take effect.

-Steve (subject4807)

edit: Thanks for all the feedback. I'm off for now. "
684," I've answered this a couple times here and there.

Any engineer should want to work at reddit for a variety of reasons:

* You get to work on interesting problems (scaling, abuse, search, data, ML, mobile)
* Your work will be seen by millions of people
* Your work will affect the lives of millions on people
* You get to work with smart people in a fun environment
* We have really generous benefits. Full health, dental, vision. We pay for parking, gyms, daycare, and a bunch of other random stuff.

As for no negotiation, we had a similar policy at Hipmunk, and it worked well. I think my reasoning might be different from Ellen's. The reason I like it is because many people are not good at negotiating, or just don't like it. We do our best to ensure comp is fair both internally and externally. A critical part of this policy is that we *always make our best offer up front*. That way, if someone comes back to us and asks for more, we can say ""no"" with a clear conscience. I have found in practice this is almost never required.

We're in the business of getting the best people we can, not the best people for as cheap as possible. "
685,"  What is your opinion on free speech today?

It's important to both our society and to Reddit, and both inside and outside of Reddit it's an incredibly complex issue. My position as it relates to Reddit is that we try to let as much go as possible because it's important to have a realistic view of the world. I believe in many ways that Reddit is the online reflection of humanity, and we want to preserve that. However, we also feel obligated to take steps to prevent real-world harm to people and to protect Reddit itself. Often, this puts us in a position of having to make some very difficult decisions.

 do you agree with the statement ""Subreddits should be banned if they make reddit look bad, even if they are technically legal.""?

No, but the inverse isn't true either.

 Does reddit thinks about adding a ""nsfl"" button?

Yes. That was an alternative name suggestion to quarantining, incidentally. Our work isn't done in this department.

 What do you think?

Totally on board. "
686, It just came up yesterday. We all agreed it was dumb. Stay tuned. 
687," First, I'm sorry to hear that.

Second, it's a reasonable request. There are a variety of reasons someone might want to disassociate from content, and I'd prefer they didn't have to delete it to do so because it leaves holes in comment threads. "
688," Yes, but it will be called ""Reddit"" and we're actively working on it. "
689," We have a small presence in NYC, mostly for ad sales, though.

For the foreseeable future I want all product people (product, design, engineering) and general leadership to be in the same office. It's easier to build our culture when everyone is face-to-face. "
690," Other than the thousand general product improvements we'd like to make, the big problems on our mind are community discovery (it's hard for redditors to find new communities, let alone new users), and community growth (how do you attract new users to your up-and-coming community. Two sides of the same coin, but both supremely important in my mind. "
691," 1. It's something we discuss somewhat regularly around here. We all agree it's a problem. It's not our largest problem at the moment, but we will address it.

2. I don't think the notion of blessing a specific set of communities is sustainable. It requires too much intervention on our side, and it also prevents new communities from breaking into popularity because they hit the ""default ceiling"". I'm looking forward to tackling this.

3. We don't control the content of the defaults, so it's largely up to them. We do work with them from time to time on more ""event""-like situations. For example, if we have connections to a prominent candidate, we can help find them a place on Reddit.  "
692," We're still maintaining that stock for this purpose. The challenge is the mechanism through which we distribute it, and when. There are many legal and tax implications that need to be worked through. I'm sad to say we haven't spent a ton of time on it since I've returned other than to reaffirm, that yes, we are going to do it.

Because I don't anticipate a liquidity event for a while (nor are we profitable), we don't have anything to distribute, so we're not in a huge rush. "
693, We're focusing our mobile resources on the main Reddit apps. 
694," I alluded to this in another comment. In addition to better tools, making it easier for new communities to grow will help, a new front page algorithm is a big first step in this direction.

update: I can't tell if everyone disagrees, or if I wasn't clear, so I'll try again. I think the best solution to overzealous mods is to make it easier to create new communities under new leadership. The mods basically have one blunt tool right now, automoderator, and not a lot of time. Our first step is to provide better tooling for mods to enforce their own rules, and better defenses against abusive users. When all of this is combined, I expect far fewer abuses. "
695, This is purely a function of hiring. I hope to be on it early next year. 
696," It's not just adding more servers. The specific short-term fixes involve looking for optimizations in code and addressing some glaring infrastructure issues: improving our internal caching, for example.

Longer term, we'll rewrite everything, one piece at a time. Organizing the rest of our stack so this is possible is the first step. We need to get to more of a [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture). "
697, Yes 
698," Hard to measure, but yes, I think so. It's a lot harder to cherry-pick toxic, yet vanishingly small, communities to vilify Reddit.

e: punctuation "
699," Still working on it! Testing new stuff next week, I believe. It's a multi-part plan: first, we need to provide alternatives to shadowbanning. We're working on these now. It's worth noting the admins (Reddit employees) and moderators (Reddit users) have different tools, both inadequate. Second, we need to get everyone comfortable (admins, moderators, users) with new tools (basically, non shadowban enforcement). Third, we need to make it easier for new communities to grow.

It's not happening overnight, but it is happening. "
700," Right, Upvoted is really aimed at non-redditors. The goal is to show more people all the cool stuff that happens on Reddit every day, and hopefully bring more people into our communities.

Our short term plans I've talked about a lot: release proper mobile apps, mod/community tools, stabilize infrastructure, hire, hire hire.

Long term, we believe every person in the world should be able to enjoy Reddit. To do this, we need to improve the product in just about every dimension. "
701," We need to update constants in the hot algorithm, but after the the mistake we made a couple months ago (We were fixing another bug and unintentionally affected the front page. It's since been reverted, but that's what got this conversation started.), we want to make sure we test things better. In order to do that, we need to rebuild the testing infrastructure for the front page, which is nearly finished.

Longer-term, we've outgrown the current algorithm and need to devise a new one. We've got a lot of ideas here. It's just a matter of time / engineers. "
702," Protein shake. I'm actually quite hungry, but not hangry yet. We'll see how this AMA goes. "
703," One of our major priorities this quarter is to stabilize the infrastructure. We're making progress, but we still have a ways to go. "
704, Have you reported on [r/alienblue](https://www.reddit.com/r/alienblue)? 
705," It's been a little while since we've done this. Since we last talked, we've released a handful of [improvements for moderators](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews); released a few [updates to AlienBlue](https://www.reddit.com/user/alien-blue); continue to work on the bigger mod/community tools (updates next week, I believe); hired a bunch of people, including two new [community](https://www.reddit.com/user/redtaboo) [managers](https://www.reddit.com/user/sodypop); and continue to make progress on our new mobile apps.

There is a lot going on around here. Our most pressing priority is hiring, particularly engineers. If you're an engineer of any shape or size, please considering joining us. Email  jobs@reddit.com if you're interested!

update: I'm outta here. Thanks for the questions! "
706, That makes no sense. We have two ad placements: sponsored links at the top and display ads on the right. Neither are affected by the hot algorithm. 
707," I feel the same way, but we haven't found a change so far (in code or age of frontpage posts). We'll share the results of our investigation when it's more complete. We've got a few more theories we're chasing down. "
708," We've been investigating this for the past couple of weeks. The short story is nothing has actually changed on our end[1], and it really does appear to be the case that everyone is suddenly more sensitive to front-page turnover.

That said, we used to tweak constants in the hot algorithm as traffic grew, but we haven't done that in a while. Before we make any changes (big or small), we're testing them internally.

[1] We did make a change a while ago to fix a different issue, but we reverted it because it had unintended side-effects.

edit: I'm as skeptical as you all are that there isn't a changethat's why we're investigating itwe just haven't found a solid explanation yet. "
709," Funny, I didn't see ""Making hearts out of other hearts"" on this week's plan. Paging /u/Mart2d2 "
710," Thanks for the kind words. Your suggestion is something to think about. Honestly, it would be helpful for me as well. A lot has changed over the years... "
711," They can only communicate if they're on the same domain, or if they cooperate. We use a different domain for ads. "
712, Where were you when I needed an example 15 minutes ago. 
713, Airlines don't like to advertise around news about plane crashes. 
714," The big feature we lack right now is keyword targeting, and perhaps more importantly, anti-keyword targeting. Right now, advertisers have very little control over who actually sees their ads because they can only target at the community level, and they're very concerned about brand safety. Basically, they want to say, I want my ad to show around conversations about *this* topic, but not *that* topic.

As far as tracking, we will continue to serve ads in an iframe, which dramatically limits what information an advertiser sees (e.g. they don't see what urls you're on), and we will provide ways to opt-out (more than we offer now).

Philosophically, I'm as paranoid as anyone about advertisers knowing what I'm up to onlineit's a common characteristic of most Reddit employees, in factso that guides our thinking. "
715," Major UI revamp is underway with, amongst many things, more traditional navigation.

(You can also enable Classic UI mode in AlienBlue settings, which is what I personally do for the time being). "
716," Certainly not ideal. Hence, my desire to improve the algorithm.

We're seeing two things here (at least): the effects of the the disparity between the number of votes on the front page versus community pages, and the effects of the disparity between the number of votes on a Friday versus the weekend. "
717," First, traffic is higher than ever. We're considering a more consistent CEO change schedule as a result. Stay tuned.

The front page algo is the same as it has been for the past while (year? more?), with the exception of a couple weeks ago when we started fiddling with it. We often fiddle with the constants in the algo to make sure there is fresh content on the front page, but the change last week didn't work right. It's back to the way it was before. As traffic grows, front page behavior changes. So, while the algo is the same, the content very well might be aging differently from what you've been used to (we haven't measured it yet). 

My suspicion is that it isn't much different than before, just that people are more sensitive to it. That doesn't mean there isn't an issue, but rather that there has been an issue for longer than you might think.

All that said, the front page algorithm is something I'd like to spend time on sooner rather than later. I've got a bunch of ideas for improvement. Given our resources at the moment, it's going to be a bit until we get to it, so we'll look for short-term fixes in the meantime. "
718, I wouldn't not say that. 
719," When I first arrived back at Reddit, one of the first things I learned is that we were in desperate need for more technical leadership, and the first person we reached out to was Marty. He has the perfect combination of qualities we want in a CTO: [He has impressive technical chops](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Pinterest); experience growing a team through many phases (taking Pinterest from 2 to 300 engineers); very thoughtful opinions on company culture (but dont ask him about them unless youve got some time); and a long history on Reddit (he may replace his brother [Zach](https://www.reddit.com/u/mrweiner) as the most significant Weiner). "
720, He doesn't start for a few days. We'll post something when he actually starts and has time to hang out in comments. 
721, Please fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DOlPBC9kVJEhgzhcrKdV_cKCgB2qJ2X6w9AqmB9zLsA/viewform?usp=send_form). 
722, CTO is way more fun. 
723, I cannot overstate how excited we are for Marty to join us! 
724," Back in the day this was actually a Battletoads themed subreddit. That was always our original intention. Obviously things are more complicated now, but the more I think about it, we just need to do the right thing. "
725," Our policy guy here is also German. So, now I'm surrounded by disagreeing Germans. "
726," Our policy is to conform to local laws. Mentioning things unpleasant to the US government is not against the law. Hosting classified documents is, which is why when that stuff leaks, it isn't hosted here in the US. "
727," While I don't have much interest in debating you on irrelevant points, you're just plain wrong. The [BPjM is an upper-level German federal agency subordinate to the Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Department_for_Media_Harmful_to_Young_Persons). "
728," That's not true. We need to maintain relationships with governments worldwide so we continue to have an opportunity to review these issues on a case-by-case basis.

edit (mostly in response to your comment below, but expanding on this point):

As Reddit grows internationally, relationships with governments beyond our own in the United States become relevant. "
729," No, we consider each request on a case-by-case basis.

I don't want to get stuck considering too many hypotheticals, but I will entertain this one. If a government wants to ban Reddit entirely because we're the center of an uprising, there's nothing we can do to stop them. However, if they send us a takedown request for specific content, and give us a chance to consider it, we will absolutely take into account the greater context of what's going on.

We've published transparency reports in the past, and will continue to do so in the future. "
730," Of course we want to earn moneythat's how businesses continue to existbut that didn't factor into our decision here.

The issue in this case is we faced the dilemma of either banning content in specific regions or having Reddit blocked entirely in these regions. Unfortunately, there isn't a middle ground in this case.

While we believe government censorship of the Internet is wrong (not to mention futile), we also need to make practical decisions to ensure Reddit is accessible to as many people as possible around the entire world.

 "
731, I win again. 
732, I think that's a fine idea. 
733," They sexualize minors, which have been against our policies for a long time. "
734," We take banning **very** seriously. I believe we can combat negative actions like theirs by improving our own technology without banning them, so that is what we'll try first. "
735," That is what I meant by ""While participating, its important to keep in mind this value above all others: show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is,"" which is in the opening statement of the Policy. "
736," We considered this. That was the status quo, but it wasn't working. By making it more difficult to access, we can slow the negative feedback loop of: have heinous content, attract more people to contribute heinous content, Reddit becomes known more for heinous content than all the amazing stuff it does for the world. "
737," We didn't ban them for being racist. We banned them because we have to spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with them. If we want to improve Reddit, we need more people, but CT's existence and popularity has also made recruiting here more difficult. "
738," The mods of a quarantined community are not banned, so they can message us just fine. "
739," When something gets banned the mods often attempt to recreate the same communities, which we try and stay on top of, so it's an ongoing process today. "
740," It adds friction to the signup process, which we hope will cause people to think twice before opting in. "
741," No, because the mods of r/wtf are generally good about tagging things as NSFW. "
742," Right now it's all we've got, but no, I don't think shadowbanning is appropriate beyond spam. "
743, Yes 
744," It's more than that, even. We take banning very seriously, which is why it takes so long for us to do it. In this case, a small group of people were causing on outsized amount of harm to Reddit. "
745," We didn't ban them because we disagree with them. We banned them because this exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else.  "
746," It means that we can see downvoting brigades in that data, and we are working on preventing them from working. We used to do this in the past, and it worked quite well. "
747," As I stated in the post

 exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else "
748," It will always be a useful tool for fighting spammers, but we are working as fast as we can on more nuanced tools for users who violate other rules so they have a chance to learn from their mistakes. "
749," For the the time being we believe that brigading is best fought with technology, which we are actively working on. "
750," Yep, we're changing our style guide as well. It's a pain to start a sentence with reddit. "
751," Today we removed communities dedicated to animated CP and a handful of other communities that violate the spirit of the policy by making Reddit worse for everyone else: /r/CoonTown, /r/WatchNiggersDie, /r/bestofcoontown, /r/koontown, /r/CoonTownMods, /r/CoonTownMeta. "
752," They receive a message, yes. "
753," Today we are releasing an update to our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy). Our goal was to consolidate the various rules and policies that have accumulated over the years into a single set of guidelines we can point to.

Thank you to all of you who provided feedback throughout this process. Your thoughts and opinions were invaluable. This is not the last time our policies will change, of course. They will continue to evolve along with Reddit itself.

Our policies are not changing dramatically from what we have had in the past. One new concept is Quarantining a community, which entails applying a set of restrictions to a community so its content will only be viewable to those who explicitly opt in. We will Quarantine communities whose content would be considered extremely offensive to the average redditor.

Today, in addition to applying Quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else. Our most important policy over the last ten years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations.

I believe these policies strike the right balance.

update: I know some of you are upset because we banned *anything* today, but the fact of the matter is we spend a disproportionate amount of time dealing with a handful of communities, which prevents us from working on things for the other 99.98% (literally) of Reddit. I'm off for now, thanks for your feedback. RIP my inbox. "
754, Yep. Lots of plans for the front page. 
755, It is absolutely trivial to detect that. 
756, Yes 
757," I consider them in the same context as brigaders. Any automated or coordinated behaviors that undermine Reddit will be examined. That said, there are lots of bots that provide useful services as well. "
758," That is the most cynical possible interpretation, yes. It costs a trivial amount of money to host any particular community, and for communities the size we're talking about, the cost is basically non-existent.

In reality, we don't plan on banning communities just because we disagree with them, but we're under no obligation to make it easy to grow. "
759," We're building it ourselves. It was already in progress when I arrived, and it's coming along nicely. "
760," Wasn't aware of it until now, but we'll keep an eye out. "
761," While my personal views towards bigotry haven't changed, my opinion of what Reddit should do about it has. I don't think we should silence people just because their viewpoints are something we disagree with. There is value in the conversation, and we as a society need to confront these issues. This is an incredibly complex topic, and I'm sure our thinking will continue to evolve. "
762," We actually received a lot of really good feedback and wording suggestions. It felt dramatic at the time, but it was a worthwhile exercise from our point of view. "
763," Horrible, actually, but I don't think you can win an argument by simply silencing the opposition. "
764, It's a new option. 
765," It ain't easy, but we ain't stupid. "
766," When groups of people coordinate attacks (upvotes and downvotes, for example). It's particularly bad when a single person creates many accounts to do this. This undermines the integrity of Reddit, and we'll work to prevent it as best we can. "
767," That's exactly what we're thinking, yes. "
768," 1. The ideas in the policy are easy. Wording them clearly is not.

2. We need to develop the corresponding tooling to enforce it. "
769,"  Are there any hard deadlines for any of these changes? Projected ETA's other then ASAP?

No, but we are on a very short timeline. Weeks, not months, and we've been at it two weeks.

 Is there a place (like a dedicated subreddit?) that we can tune into to see progress, or maybe offer support when needed? (Community developed tools that have become official come to mind.)

Not presently, but I'm open to ideas. The challenge is that during development we go through a lot of bad ideas, and it's easier to iterate on things when you don't have 100M people breathing down your neck.

 And on that note, can we as the community do anything to enhance our corner of the Internet with you and the Admin team?

Remember that we are people too, and our primary motivation is to make Reddit an awesome place to hang out. We are way less cynical than everyone thinks we are. "
770, Right?!? 
771," Yes, you'll need to explicitly opt-in. There will be a handful of restrictions, but it's still in flux, so we'll share when it's nearly complete. "
772, Because the reddit is fun guy doesn't work here. 
773, Because it can always be better. 
774, It always does. The actual content policy will have better wording than my sleepy rambling. 
775, Thank you! It was one of the most fulfilling projects I've worked on. I've met so many people who learned to program from that course. It makes me very proud. 
776," The votes won't always be a direct reflection of reality, but they can definitely be more accurate. We do fuzz the scores though to make it difficult to tell if a particular cheating technique is working. "
777," I think timeouts are an important part of this. Plus, it makes mods/admins lives easier. "
778," This policy will likely change in the long-term. In the short-term we need to come together internally. It's been a chaotic year for everyone here, and we have a lot of rebuilding to do. The vibe around the office is already better now than it was a few weeks ago (I hope they agree!), and in a few months we'll be a lot stronger. "
779," Perhaps, but np.reddit is more of a hack in my mind. Acts of brigading are fairly obvious when we investigate the data. The challenge is to detect it in real-time, which we've been good at in the past. "
780, Me too... 
781, No. It means that if you report a PM or block someone it will actually work. 
782," Yes, but it's literally the only tool we have right now. The best thing we can do is build better tools as fast we we can, which is what we're doing. "
783," We had a very long discussion a week or so ago. Any policy changes we make will be open for discussion. At some point we'll need to draw the line and release them, but that doesn't mean they won't continue evolving. "
784," Jessica leaving is entirely to do with her family moving back to Salt Lake City. She's not leaving right this minute, and she's helping us work through the Content Policy.

We are hiring at the same time, of course, but I'm just getting warmed up. "
785, See my follow up task 
786, We'll need to handle on a case-by-case basis. The purpose of this technique is to give us a way to contain and distance ourselves from communities that we would rather not exist but aren't overtly violating any of our stated rules. 
787," We'll do our best. We can definitely see it happen when we look at the data, and it's super frustrating to watch. I know it's frustrating to be on the receiving end of it as well. We used to be much better about detecting this sort of thing, so I'm confident we can get there again. "
788," A straight-up, ""you are banned because of X"" is the first thing we need. "
789, Couldn't sleep. Decided to Reddit instead. 
790," Still in bed, but eggs are likely. "
791," I thought I'd start my day with a quick status update for you all. It's only been a couple weeks since my return, but we've got a lot going on. We are in a phase of emergency fixes to repair a number of longstanding issues that are causing all of us grief. I normally don't like talking about things before they're ready, but because many of you are asking what's going on, and have been asking for a long time before my arrival, I'll share what we're up to.

Under active development:

* Content Policy. We're consolidating all our rules into one place. We won't release this formally until we have the tools to enforce it.
* Quarantine the communities we don't want to support
* Improved banning for both admins and moderators (a less sneaky alternative to shadowbanning)
* Improved ban-evasion detection techniques (to make the former possible).
* Anti-brigading research (what techniques are working to coordinate attacks)
* AlienBlue bug fixes
* AlienBlue improvements
* Android app

Next up:

* Anti-abuse and harassment (e.g. preventing PM harassment)
* Anti-brigading
* Modmail improvements

As you can see, lots on our plates right now, but the team is cranking, and we're excited to get this stuff shipped as soon as possible!

I'll be hanging around in the comments for an hour or so.

update: I'm off to work for now. Unlike you, work for me doesn't consist of screwing around on Reddit all day. Thanks for chatting! "
792, Precisely. 
793, The challenge we have right now is shadowbanning is the only real tool moderators/admins have. We are working on more nuanced tools as we speak. 
794, Working on that too. 
795," Both, in fact. "
796, There won't be any gold on those communities 
797, This morning I thought we might be in the market for a new CEO. 
798," That's more or less the idea, yes, but I also want to claim we don't profit from them. "
799," When it comes to software development, committing to exact dates is a fool's errand.

However, I can say with great confidence it won't take six months. "
800," That's why I keep saying, ""build better tools."" We can see this in the data, and mods shouldn't have to deal with it. "
801, Appreciate the feedback. 
802," I can give you examples of things we deal with on a regular basis that would be considered harassment:

 * Going into self help subreddits for people dealing with serious emotional issues and telling people to kill themselves.
 * Messaging serious threats of harm to users towards themselves or their families.
 * Less serious attacks - but ones that are unprovoked and sustained and go beyond simply being an annoying troll. An example would be following someone from subreddit to subreddit repeatedly and saying youre an idiot when they arent engaging you or instigating anything. This is not only harassment but spam, which is also against the rules.
 * Finding users external social media profiles and taking harassing actions or using the information to threaten them with doxxing.
 * Doxxing users.

Its important to recognize that this is not about being annoying. You get into a heated conversation and tell someone to fuck off? No one cares. But if you follow them around for a week to tell them to fuck off, despite their moving on - or tell them youre going to find and kill them, youre crossing a line and thats where we step in. "
803," I meant specifically in regard to ""content creators."" For example, it used to be common that a site would write a script that automatically spammed multiple subreddits every time they wrote something. "
804,"  ""since you're fat you need to commit suicide""

This is the only one worth considering as harassment. Lobbing insults or saying offensive things don't automatically make something harassment.

Our Harassment policy says ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them,"" which I think is pretty clear. "
805," Well, only one of us actually works here. "
806, I hope you didn't lose too much money :-/ 
807," Ill try

Content Policy

1. Harboring unpopular ideologies is not a reason for banning.

2. (Based on the titles alone) Some of these should be banned since they are inciting violence, others should be separated.

3. This is the area that needs the most explanation. Filling someones inbox with PMs saying, Kill yourself is harassment. Calling someone stupid on a public forum is not.

4. Its an impossible concept to achieve

5. Yes. The whole point of this exercise is to consolidate and clarify our policies.

6. The Report button, /r/reddit.com modmail, contact@reddit.com (in that order). Well be doing a lot of work in the coming weeks to help our community managers respond quickly. Yes, if you can identify harassment of others, please report it.

Brigading

1. Mocking and calling people stupid is not harassment. Doxxing, following users around, flooding their inbox with trash is.

2. I have lots of ideas here. This is a technology problem I know we can solve. Sorry for the lack of specifics, but well keep these tactics close to our chest for now.

Related

1. The content creators one is an issue Id like to leave to the moderators. Beyond this, if its submitted with a script, its spam.

2. While we didnt *create* reddit to be a bastion of free speech, the concept is important to us. /r/creepshots forced us to confront these issues in a way we hadnt done before. Although I wasnt at Reddit at the time, I agree with their decision to ban those communities.

3. The main things we need to implement is the other type of NSFW classification, which isnt too difficult.

4. No, weve been debating non-stop since I arrived here, and will continue to do so. Many people in this thread have made good points that well incorporate into our policy. Clearly defining Harassment is the most obvious example.

5. I know. It was frustrating for me to watch as an outsider as well. Now that Im here, Im looking forward to moving forward and improving things.
 "
808," I agree it's a problem, but we haven't thought through a solution yet. "
809," Nothing is changing in Reddit's policy here. /r/trees is totally fine. At a very high level, the idea is that we will ban something if it is against the law for Reddit to host it, and I don't believe you examples qualify. "
810," I've tried a lot of names, and none of them fit. I'm all ears. The challenge is that the content itself is very difficult to describe as well. "
811, That's the exact plan: centralize the rules. 
812," I can tell you with confidence that these specific communities are not what we are referring to. Not even close.

But this is also why I prefer separation over banning. Banning is like capital punishment, and we don't want to do it except in the clearest of cases. "
813, [It was good enough for the Supreme Court of the United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it) 
814," I stand by my statement like I'd like to use it as seldom as possible, and we are building better tools as we speak. "
815, I'm specifically soliciting feedback on this language. The goal is to make it as clear as possible. 
816," Right. This isn't different from what we have right now, but we really need to enforce it better. "
817," There are many reasons for content being removed from a particular subreddit, but it's not at all clear right now what's going on. Let me give you a few examples:

* The user deleted their post. If that's what they want to do, that's fine, it's gone, but we should at least say so, so that the mods or admins don't get accused of censorship.
* A mod deleted the post because it was off topic. We should say so, and we should probably be able to see what it was *somehow* so we can better learn the rules.
* A mod deleted the post because it was spam. We can put these in a spam area.
* A mod deleted a post from a user that constantly trolls and harasses them. This is where I'd really like to invest in tooling, so the mods don't have to waste time in these one-on-one battles.

edit: A spam area makes more sense than hiding it entirely. "
818," To be fair, I did the same thing. "
819," Agreed, this is a problem if true.

The first step is give the mods better tools so they don't need to resort to tactics like this. "
820,"  How much of the push toward removing ""ugly"" elements of Reddit comes from the motivation to monetize Reddit?

Zero.

edit: only on Reddit would someone pay to gild this comment so others can continue to downvote it more easily. "
821, I explain this in my post. Similar to NSFW but with a different warning and an explicit opt-in. 
822, We won't formally change or policy until we have the tools to support it. Giving moderators better tools to deal with individuals is an important part of this process. Giving our employed community managers additional tools to assist the moderators is also required. 
823," Spirited debates are in important part of what makes Reddit special. Our goal is to spell out clear rules that everyone can understand. Any banning of content will be carefully considered against our public rules.

 "
824," Sure. /r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape.

/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning. "
825," Very good question, and that's one of the things we need to be clear about. I think we have an intuitive sense of what this means (e.g. death threats, inciting rape), but before we release an official update to our policy we will spell this out as precisely as possible.

Update: I added an example to my post. It's ok to say, ""I don't like this group of people."" It's not ok to say, ""I'm going to kill this group of people."" "
826," We'll consider banning subreddits that clearly violate the guidelines in my post--the ones that are illegal or cause harm to others.

There are many subreddits whose contents I and many others find offensive, but that alone is not justification for banning.

/r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape.

/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning.

edit: elevating my reply below so more people can see it.

 "
827," First, they don't conflict directly, but the common wording is unfortunate.

As I state in my post, the concept of free speech is important to us, but completely unfettered free speech can cause harm to others and additionally silence others, which is what we'll continue to address. "
828," We started Reddit to beas we said back then with our tongues in our cheeksThe front page of the Internet. Reddit was to be a source of enough news, entertainment, and random distractions to fill an entire day of pretending to work, every day. Occasionally, someone would start spewing hate, and I would ban them. The community rarely questioned me. When they did, they accepted my reasoning: because I dont want that content on our site.

As we grew, I became increasingly uncomfortable projecting my worldview on others. More practically, I didnt have time to pass judgement on everything, so I decided to judge nothing. 

So we entered a phase that can best be described as Dont Ask, Dont Tell. This worked temporarily, but once people started paying attention, few liked what they found. A handful of painful controversies usually resulted in the removal of a few communities, but with inconsistent reasoning and no real change in policy.

One thing that isn't up for debate is why Reddit exists. Reddit is a place to have open and authentic discussions. The reason were careful to restrict speech is because people have more open and authentic discussions when they aren't worried about the speech police knocking down their door. When our purpose comes into conflict with a policy, we make sure our purpose wins.

As Reddit has grown, we've seen additional examples of how unfettered free speech can make Reddit a less enjoyable place to visit, and can even cause people harm outside of Reddit. Earlier this year, [Reddit took a stand and banned non-consensual pornography](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/2x0g9v/from_1_to_9000_communities_now_taking_steps_to/). This was largely accepted by the community, and the world is a better place as a result (Google and Twitter have followed suit). Part of the reason this went over so well was because there was a very clear line of what was unacceptable.

Therefore, today we're announcing that we're considering a set of additional restrictions on what people can say on Redditor at least say on our public pagesin the spirit of our mission.

These types of content are prohibited [1]:

 * Spam
 * Anything illegal (i.e. things that are actually illegal, such as copyrighted material. Discussing illegal activities, such as drug use, is not illegal)
 * Publication of someones private and confidential information
 * Anything that incites harm or violence against an individual or group of people (it's ok to say ""I don't like this group of people."" It's not ok to say, ""I'm going to kill this group of people."")
 * Anything that [harasses, bullies, or abuses](http://www.redditblog.com/2015/05/promote-ideas-protect-people.html) an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)[2]
 * Sexually suggestive content featuring minors

There are other types of content that are specifically classified:

 * Adult content must be flagged as NSFW (Not Safe For Work). Users must opt into seeing NSFW communities. This includes pornography, which is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it.
 * Similar to NSFW, another type of content that is difficult to define, but you know it when you see it, is the content that violates a common sense of decency. This classification will require a login, must be opted into, will not appear in search results or public listings, and will generate no revenue for Reddit.

We've had the NSFW classification since nearly the beginning, and it's worked well to separate the pornography from the rest of Reddit. We believe there is value in letting all views exist, even if we find some of them abhorrent, as long as they dont pollute peoples enjoyment of the site. Separation and opt-in techniques have worked well for keeping adult content out of the common Redditors listings, and we think itll work for this other type of content as well. 

No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. Weve spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we dont want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but its more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission.

[1] This is basically what we have right now. Id appreciate your thoughts. A very clear line is important and our language should be precise.

[2] Wording we've used elsewhere is this ""Systematic and/or continued actions to torment or demean someone in a way that would make a reasonable person (1) conclude that reddit is not a safe platform to express their ideas or participate in the conversation, or (2) fear for their safety or the safety of those around them.""

edit: added an example to clarify our concept of ""harm""
edit: attempted to clarify harassment based on our existing policy

update: I'm out of here, everyone. Thank you so much for the feedback. I found this very productive. I'll check back later. "
829," Hey Everyone,

There has been a lot of discussion lately on reddit, in the news, and here internally about reddits policy on the more offensive and obscene content on our platform. Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.

The overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we dont have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.

Neither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. Its something weve been thinking about for quite some time.  We havent had the tools to enforce policy, but now were building those tools and reevaluating our policy.

We as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, Ill be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.

PS - I wont be able to hang out in comments right now. Still meeting everyone here! "
830, I did. I mentioned I was disappointed because I was looking forward to working with her. 
831," Cool, thanks. "
832," I think I've said many times that my intention isn't to make anyone's duties more difficult. I believe we can build better tools that will save everyone time.

I also believe that shadow banning shouldn't be the only option because it isn't needed in many cases. It happens that in practice is *is* the only option, but we can build a better variety of tools.

After seeing all the discussion over the weekend, I think the most important thing we can do is work on tools to curb harassment of mods. I won't have time for an AMA tomorrow, but I'll find some time later this week. "
833, acknowledged. 
834, Yes. Have you seen my comment karma lately? 
835," Not exactly, but sort of. "
836," Yes, I should have been more sensitive to the harassment angle yesterday. The next time I do a big public AMA, I'll keep that in mind.

In short, it's important, and I think there is quite a bit we can do. I want reddit to continue to grow, and I think one of the main obstacles to growth right now is how hostile reddit can be.

 "
837," Totally get it.

I know people are on edge about me right now. That's expected.

I think if we can build better tech for harassment, avoiding bans, alt detection, etc., a lot of the other problems become simpler. "
838," Yeah, I see 'em. Most of them, at least (I won't get to read all 5k I received on day 1). "
839, I'd like to hear more about this. Seems to be a recurring theme today-- people receiving threats. 
840," I'm not even talking about modtools in that quote. It's about the perception of reddit the company banning users, which I don't want us (the company) doing.

Everyone, let me be clear. My intention is to make your jobs easier. I'm not going to come in and remove a bunch of features you depend on, but rather to add more tools so clumsy things like shadowbanning aren't necessary. This is going to require some tech cleverness, but I know we can do it because I've done stuff like this plenty of times before.

I have a lot of ideas. We'll try them out. If things improve, we proceed, if they do not, we try something else. My goal is for you all to spend way less time doing mundane things like tracking down trolls, removing spam, arguing with idiots, etc.

My other goal is to remove some of the mystery from how communities are managed from the reader's perspective. Seeing people cry ""censorship"" every time a spammer is caught doesn't do anyone any favors. 

(I'm x-posting this in the other mod subreddits)

edit: added the first sentence. "
841, We all had our roles to play. 
842," Technically? Nothing. But, an adversarial relationship with the mods is the opposite of what we want. "
843," Undermine them with technology, of course. "
844," I think mods should be able to moderate, but there should also be some mechanism to see what was removed. It doesn't have to be easy, but it shouldn't be impossible. "
845," No. We use it at Hipmunk and it works really well. A key component is paying the market rate. I don't like to start relationships with a negotiation. If we make our best offer first, we don't have to worry about it. "
846, Would be about as effective... 
847," Yes, we have an amazing opportunity to change the world.

No, I just didn't want to look stupid in front of my parents. "
848," 1000 duck sized horses. Since they can't climb stairs, you can easily get away from them long enough to figure out how to drown them. "
849," Aaron and I were very close for about five months. During that time we ported reddit from Lisp to Python and collaborated on a lot of ideas that are still important to reddit today.

We had a falling out around the time reddit sold, and I regret to say I didn't really know him when he passed. That whole situation was ugly, and the world is worse for it. "
850," Really good question, thank you.

I think the new user / core user dichotomy is the biggest product challenge we fact right now. Solve it, and we are unstoppable. A vague answer, I know, but this is one of the big things on my mind. "
851,"  What is your view on reddit's employees negotiating their salary?

Hipmunk has this policy as well, and it works well for us. It only works if you pay the market rate, which we will. We're not in the business of getting good people for as cheap as possible. "
852," It's going to take a little time to find the right balance. Hipmunk is in a stable place, and most of my value is provided in a few key meetings every week, which I will still be attending. Also, they're five blocks away, so I can go over there whenever I need. "
853, I think we need more official Reddit Android Developers. 
854, I want to get the Content Policy written first so everyone knows what is acceptable behavior and what is not. 
855," Not ignoring you, but I think I've answered all of these in this thread. "
856, reddit had better technology than Digg. I don't think Voat has better technology than reddit. 
857," I haven't been posting much, but I have been reading reddit pretty much every day for ten years, which is more than you can say. "
858," My father was an engineer at GM for 30 years.

My step-father was a heavy hitter in the business world for a while, most publicly he was the CMO of Unisys, but that place is a cluster, so he left. "
859, Will definitely consider it. I want to hear the reasoning for why they were removed in the first place. Perhaps there is a better solution to that problem. 
860," They can ban what they want, but I'd like to make it transparent what was actually banned. Some sort of ""garbage can"" or something. "
861," reddit the company intervening will always be a last resort, but from a philosophical point of view (we build the platform, you populate it), and a practical point of view (we ain't got time for that). "
862, Agreed. 
863," Thinking in realtime: we probably don't want to undo a mod's decision, but if they leave forever, we can re-claim it. "
864," reddit has a lot of cash. Monetization isn't a short-term concern of ours. Yes, we will continue to experiment with different efforts so that when time is right we know what works and what does not.

 "
865," Hey Everyone, I'm Steve, aka subject4807, the new CEO around here. For those of you who don't know me, I founded reddit ten years ago with my college roommate Alexis, aka kn0thing. Since then, reddit has grown far larger than my wildest dreams. I'm so proud of what it's become, and I'm very excited to be back.

I know we have a lot of work to do. One of my first priorities is to re-establish a relationship with the community. This is the first of what I expect will be many AMAs (I'm thinking I'll do these weekly).

My proof: it's me!

edit: I'm done for now. Time to get back to work. Thanks for all the questions! "

871," Nominate people here, and hopefully we can improve the spam false-positive issue that has been bothering you all.

We need people who are willing to watch the spam listing for this reddit and make sure it is only spam that is blocked. "
872," We're working on a couple of things that will hopefully help avoid future eruptions like the one of the past few days:

 * We're improving the popularity metric for reddits. Specifically, attacking a reddit will not boost its popularity. This will take some time, but we'll get there.

 * No mercy for attacking a reddit. Starting now, anyone who mass-downvotes every link on a reddit will have their voting privileges removed.

**FAQ**

*Why was /r/atheism removed from the default reddit list for non-logged-in users again?*

For the past few months the default reddits have been the top ten most popular reddits, which are automatically computed each morning from the previous day's activity. /r/atheism went through a couple of weeks under attack from other users causing it to appear more popular than it should have been. At the time this was an isolated issue, so we didn't do much about it. When the same thing happened to /r/moviecritic, we addressed the issue by removing the two less popular reddits from the list by hand. Given the two bullet points above, this will no longer be necessary.

*Why was /r/atheism removed from the top bar as well?*

This was a side-effect of how we removed it from the front page. We used the same function for both returning the list of reddits for the front page and returning the list of reddits for the top bar. It was a mistake, and is fixed now.

*Why is the /r/christianity reddit so popular all of a sudden?*

Contrary to popular belief, this isn't my or anyone else at reddit's handy-work. It is because a handful of /r/atheism users are downvoting every story on /r/christianity. As I have previously mentioned, this actually makes a reddit more popular, an unintended side-effect of how we rank reddits. I'm working on undoing the attack, but this will take time. Of course, I will also undo any attacks against any other reddits as well.

*Will /r/atheism ever appear on the front page?*

If it gets more popular, it will be possible.

*But it has more than 50,000 subscribers, it must be popular!*

Subscribers aren't a factor in a reddit's popularity. It's popularity is determined by level of activity.

*You said something previously about not all content being appropriate for the front page. What's the deal with that?*

In the past we chose the front-page reddits by hand, and in the future we might do that again, but it's not something we're actively working on. There are over 25,000 communities on reddit, and only 10 appear on the front page. It's nothing personal. We want to have a large variety of content on the front page to demonstrate that there is something here for everyone. If we start engineering the front page again, it'll be clear what we're doing, and how we're doing it.

*Everything you say is a lie. You clearly hate atheists. Why should I believe you now?*

Ever since Alexis and I founded reddit.com over four years ago, we've worked hard to make this a place where anyone can come and share new and interesting links. We've (and me, specifically) have made mistakes, but we've done our best to fix them and move on, and I think our actions over the past four years speak for themselves. You're free to dislike me/us, and we will proudly continue to provide a forum for you to do so on this site. "
873," Skip to the second half if you don't care about how we got to this point.

First, a little history: When we first allowed users to create their
own reddits, every link from every reddit had an equal chance at being
seen on our front page. We had to tweak this slightly with the rise in
popularity of the [nsfw](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw) reddit and put some reddits behind an ""are
you over 18?"" barrier, a change that was welcomed by most users. Next,
we allowed users to choose which reddits appear on their front page,
but it wasn't until we started normalizing the front page that we ran
into issues.

When the front page is normalized, a link that is #1 in a small reddit
is basically equal in hotness to a link that is #1 in a large reddit.
This helps prevent small reddits from being washed out by the larger
ones. Because of this change we had to also limit the number of
reddits that make up the front page, otherwise things would jump
around wildly (a user could create a new reddit, submit one link, and
since that link was #1 in its reddit, it could appear on the front
page). For quite some time we maintained this list of front page
reddits by hand.

Maintaining the list of front page reddits became tedious after a
while, so we added a new algorithm to find the most active reddits
automatically. This algorithm purposefully ignores the number of
subscribers when choosing reddits since that number is so easy to
game. The popularity of a reddit is based on the number of
submissions, votes, and general level of activity of the reddit. The
algorithm changes from time to time, and we don't describe it fully to
mitigate gaming it. We use the top ten reddits returned by this
algorithm to make up the default non-logged-in front page.

**Here's the explanation part you're looking for**

A couple of weeks ago the [moviecritic](http://www.reddit.com/r/moviecritic) reddit popped into the top ten
reddits, causing quite a stir. The reddit isn't used for new and
interesting links, but rather for links to movies: sometimes old and
sometimes new. Users were upset that moviecritic was taking up
front-page space and started attacking the reddit by downvoting
everything in sight. Users of the [atheism](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism) reddit had been under
attacks like this for weeks. Unfortunately, attacking a reddit
generates a lot of activity on that reddit and makes our algorithm
think the reddit is more popular than it really is, making the problem
even worse. 

Seeing as this might become an ongoing problem, we added the ability
to prevent certain reddits from appearing in the top ten. We flagged
moviecritic and atheism as two such reddits, hopefully allowing these
reddits to grow in peace. I should have posted this explanation then
instead of waiting until now, and for that I apologize.

Given the nature and somtimes polarizing tone of the
content on the atheism reddit, it will likely always garner the ire of
many other users. Showcasing religious flame-wars only serves to lower the level of discourse on the site as a whole, and unknowingly walking into such a flame-war isn't the first-time experience we'd like new users to have here, which is why we think it best to leave things the way they are.  

There are thousands of communities on reddit covering a wide range of
topics. Most are for sharing new and interesting content from around
the web, and others are strictly for discussion. We hope there is a
place for everyone on reddit, and we also hope you realize not
everything found on reddit is appropriate for the front page.

UPDATE: I'll try and rephrase a point that I didn't get across before. /moviecritic and /atheism aren't legitimate top ten reddits. They appeared that way because they were under attack, making them appear even more popular. Removing atheism from the top ten by hand isn't about censoring, it's about a shortcoming in our popularity metric. We'll fix the problem, and that'll be the end of it. "
