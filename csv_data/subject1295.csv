30," Uh-oh! I said it! Yep, thats right ladies and gentlemen, just because you have or think you have depressi0n doesnt mean you are above everyone. 

First, Ill explain the basic gist of the sub.

Someone on Facebook or Instagram posts some sort of message along the lines of Dont give up, tomorrow will be better or Some people have it worse than you, look at the brightside.

Then some member of the sub finds it, screenshots it, and posts it.

Finally, its a race to comment on how that person is insane or doesnt understand how depressi0n works.

Need to see for yourself? - r/thanksimcured

Now I would completely understand if it was, for example, a text from your parents or a post on a help forum, because then it really was a pathetic attempt to cure peoples illnesses. But these people hunt down posts that arent even (a) directed at them, (b) intended to cure depressi0n, or (c) rude or ignorant and get thousands of upvotes in return. Thats not right. And if you actually have the guts to crap on something that was meant to bring joy to peoples day, then to say wow thx guess my depressi0n is gone now haha, youre the toxic piece of cancer, not them.

(Dear mods: I believe that this doesnt belong in the ment4l health forum so much as the main subreddit, so Im changing words to beat the bot) "

64," Thats not... comic sans, is it? "
65," Honestly, you shouldnt be getting so heavily downvoted. Youre not saying anything unreasonable, and I kinda agree that all the make-up is a shock because its different from how we see them in the show. Besides, your logic is sound, whether people agree or not. Ill suffer some casualties in saying this, but I think a lot of people want to pretend that the show is real and the actors are always in the right, and you just kinda crushed that for them. "
