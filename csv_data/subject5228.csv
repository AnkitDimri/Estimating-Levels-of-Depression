6," When I was younger I had recurring nightmares of awful things. Walking through my living room and being tickled mercilessly by some ghost creature. There was a ghost whose would hurt my family if I said his name. Along with these recurring nightmares the house smelled like worcestershire, and we absolutely could not find the source of it. I was about 8, I dont believe in supernatural stuff, but god that house and time of my life is an exception. "

17," Got mine recently through a driving school. If its in your budget, I recommend going that route. Most will let you take the test in the car they provide during practice. "
18," My scarf keeps getting fatter too! My first project, Im sure Ill get the hang of it over time "
19," Im working on my first project! Its only knit stitches, but my thinking is that practice makes perfect. Seeing the scarf to life is such a fulfilling feeling. How long did it take you? "

21," Rubbing it in??! No, I need someone to share my excitement with!! All I want to do lately is talk about disney

Edit: this was meant to be a reply. I dont know how to reddit "

38," I made The Hunger Games. In my version I locked 8 sims in a house with 8 beds,about 3 toilets, and a couple of showers. There was a kitchen, but I would lock it every 12 hours for 12 hours. Sometimes Id lock it more frequently or longer if they werent dying enough. Id breed the ones who were the farthest away from dying of starvation when another sim dies. "

43," Im also 30 days out! No kids to entertain here, but I do need to keep myself occupied or Ill go crazy with anticipation. Im on mobile, cant format very well at all, sorry in advance lol. Some ideas would be to make your own Minnie ears, and I believe you can write a letter to Mickey and the gang and theyll send you one back. You could color in a Disney coloring book. Make a fun countdown, maybe with a paper chain or something. Talk about everything youre excited about, and what kind of pins will be the best to find.

Edit: sorry, just realized you already said coloring pages. "

The staff blames you for being there, and makes you feel terrible for not controlling your illness. Everyones advice is to do and say what they want you to so you can go home. "

115," Your first question asked who has it harder. To that, I say women. Periods, menopause, HPV, yeast infections, TSS, high beauty standards, birth control, pregnancy. With that being said, I still wish to stay a woman. We are badass and pretty. Sometimes I want a penis though. "
116," Probably men? Being birthers we go through a lot. Periods from the age of 11-12. When we dont have those anymore we have menopause. We have to worry about HPV and TSS. Birth control. I dont want to say we are more emotionally unstable but... idk I think I do want to say that. I think men are angrier. We have very high standard that we are made to feel we need fit. I acknowledge that men also have issues and they are all very valid, but damn us bitches got it hard. "

140," Thats awesome! Having a job you like is so important, and its great that youre working your way up. Im working on getting a job I like. I really plan on staying, and Im hoping I can. I dont want my resume to look bad :/ "
141," Wow! Im thinking with such a high turnover rate, if Im one that stays maybe Ill be considered for a promotion. I know it will be a learning curve but Im ready. Thanks for sharing! Its nice to hear that someone stuck with it. All I read on here and around the internet is how its awful. "
142," Ive only ever worked in fast food and an arcade. Im 19 and Im starting at a call center in a week! I hear so many terrible things, but Im so motivated to do good. Ive heard the horror stories, and Im still going through with it. The idea of actually having a good (a 3$ raise from what Im doing now, and twice the hours) job brings me so much joy for now.  So, what are your tales from the call center? Or, when did you get the first job you felt was good, and what was it? "
143, Kick them! They always give me crystals ;) 
144, Silly bands!!! God I loved those so much.

Craving  snacks, Hungry +1.
Unpleasant surroundings, Uncomfortable +2.

Overall: Very Uncomfortable "
155,  
156," I have Cats and Dogs, Seasons, Get Famous, City Living, and Vampires. My favorite pack is Cats and Dogs. I absolutely love Brindleton Bay. The build items and hair options in CAS are some of my favorites. Having pets is pretty cool too :D 

I like Seasons too. It definitely makes the game feel more realistic. The calendars and holidays are a plus.

Edit; this was meant to be a reply but whatever "
157, I also just made a save where I deleted every lot. I moved into the biggest one with two very very ugly sims. Theyre named Adam and Eve. Im doing a rags to riches/legacy/uglacy challenge type thing. Im going to try to populate the world. 
158, Try the super sim challenge! Its kept me invested  for a while. 
159, I love this so much! Thank you for sharing. What are all the packs you own? 
160, Ask to be squirted 
161, I second this. MTG. 
162, Sex 
163, Cartoons. Spongebob and stuff 
164, Thank you! 
165," I work at an arcade and so far Ive had 2 encounters that have really left me feeling creeped out. Both instances include them asking my name, age, where I live(d), and how old I am. They were both men that seemed to be a bit off. The first one seemed anti social and just plain weird. He was a bit more invasive, asking where I went to school, if I graduated, what my last name is, etc.  The second guy seemed like he mightve been on drugs. He had his son there and the kid was saying dad Im tired and want to go home he was also saying dad thats not a basketball as his dad was playing with a playground ball thing. Irrelevant details, but strange nonetheless. "
166,  
167,  
168," Mermaids! Im also very excited for the CAS items, and swimming in the ocean. 

Not sunburns though, those hurt :( "
169, Thanks! I just have to get through these last 2 hours. It comes out today! Im excited 
170," I wanna go home ;-; work sucks

Edit: good otherwise. Im seeing Toy Story later. "
171," Argument

Im bored at work and want a discussion. You seem to be the only one who has a problem with it. "
172, That sounds a bit odd... Lets make a baby to take to the adoption center! They sure could use more 
173," Well since you offered a discussion... I asked this on another persons comment, but what if the method of birth control someone is using failed? (Just want healthy discussion, I respect any opinions you may have) "
174, Well good luck to you guys! I hope it all goes as planned 
175, Oof controversy bad 
176, Pro-death ftw! Save yourself from years of hardship 
177, What if the condom broke? 
178, I respect that 
179," If youve felt otherwise before, what led you to change your mind? "
180, I was thinking Disney World and some dinner. Maybe get to second base. Whatever it consents to ya know? 
181, Can we take your prostate? 
182," Huh, I never thought of it that way. I wonder how itd change society. "

186, Your mom is dead. 
187," Yes. Ive done it before and it isnt too difficult. Im not a big fan of chicken, so cutting that out was very easy. There are tons of delicious meat-free foods. It felt healthier in a way. "

195, CLOACA 
196, My sim has the mean trait. She made them angry so I had her and her husband kick them all. They dropped crystals. 
197," Probably the no experience part. I really dont mind. The mod is the only one whose opinion matters. I mean, the community opinion matters, but I think everyone who found this thread so late are just people trying to get some power. 

Everyone is about enforcing rules and I get it, I would do that too. I wouldnt just be a police officer though, I would try to get some kind of organization. #voteforihateyou10012019 "
198, What are you enjoying most so far? 
199," Please delete this if it isnt allowed! I started a discord server for us simmers to Get Together and share everything about our sims. Feel free to join! 
https://discord.gg/Z6s7ndk "
200," Hey! I have absolutely no experience with being a moderator. :) After asking about getting a chat room set up for us simmers, I was curious about what was going on with the mods of the group. Checked out the profiles and here I am. I did indeed set up a discord which is slowly getting rolling. Just an 18 y.o. girl working part time who is obsessed with The Sims 4. I lurk this subreddit every chance I get.

If it doesnt sound too intrusive, I would create a thread asking the community how they feel about having certain weekly threads to try and keep the repetitive posts down. It would be a democracy not a dictatorship. 

TL;DR- I have no experience. What I do have is a passion for the sims, this community, and too much free time. DM if youd like to bring me aboard. "
201, I made a discord! Its in the posts edit if you want. 
202, Made one if youre interested. Edited the post 
203, Edited the post ^_^ 
204," I created one! Im sure it wont get many people, but its there if ya want. "
205, We need Sims Addicts Anonymous! 
206," I dont know who else thinks so, or if it already exists, but I think a group chat on here for us would be awesome!

Edit: I went ahead and created a discord server, feel free to join. https://discord.gg/Z6s7ndk "
207," Oof. One game I put a teen and her parents in an apartment. The father started having an affair with the next door neighbor, eventually having a baby with her. I made the wife walk in on them, get very sad, and file for a divorce. I moved him into the baby mommas house. The daughter was filled with angst and got turned into a vampire. 

Another save is a mental hospital. I have a small house with the bare necessities filled with erratic sims. Well, I call it my hunger games. I lock the kitchen until one starved to death (or 2, or 3). I see who had the longest amount of time left before starvation, and have them reproduce by playing with genetics. Theyre too miserable to woohoo. 

I just started the 100 baby challenge in my most recent save! "
208," I could listen to people talk about sims all day long. I think I have an addiction. Speaking of which, whats happening in your game(s) right now? "
209, I had a famous vlogger who started producing music when she maxed out media production. Requires Get Famous but she made 8k a day. 
210, I have a new way to play tonight. 
211, I keep reading D D as Dungeons and Dragons and I hate myself 
212, Im just saying they made two separate accounts to post basically the same thing. 
213, u/iheartsimmers101 
214, I disagree 
215, This is their second post lmao. They made 2 
216, I recently got both as my only EP. I like City Living a bit more. Making a 5-star celebrity is fun the first time. I really love the apartments and the festivals because I have a hard time being social on the sims. It sounds like get famous may suit you better though! I like City Livings world better than Del Sol valley. My advice is to watch some reviews and see in depth what each one offers. 
217," I got get famous and I really feel like I could do without. It was a fun playthrough. I got it so I could be a vlogger, and after getting City Living, I learn there is a Social Media career??! Thats really what I wanted in the first place. Get Famous isnt all that great but I do enjoy some of the lavish build mode items. "
218, My butler did that the other day! It was horrifying 
219," I think I have a problem. I bought another bundle and I got City Living! A teenage girl and her parents. She spends her night doing homework and hanging out with her neighbor, and I think a random townie? Im not sure if he lives in the city yet. His name is Akira, hes a young adult, and shes in love. When she ages up they will definitely (maybe) ((hopefully)) be a thing. She flirts with him through compliments and hugs right now. I also got vampires. I dont want to be bit though because I love the festivals and I think theyre all outdoors! :( also got laundry stuff "
220, Im glad Im not the only one 
221," Get a bundle! 50 or 60 for a EP, a game pack, and a stuff pack! "
222," Thank you so much! Im out of here at 2:30, but times going by nice and fast. Im also a serial sim cheater. :) 

Good job on building a house! I just use gallery houses and redecorate them. Also good luck on staying pure "
223, Get famous is great. I think Im becoming a sims junkie and Im fiending for another bundle. Do you guys have any other ones you like a lot? 
224, My dream is to WooHoo the Grim Reaper. 
225, I love the drama :D do you just rotate through and play different households equally? 
226, You dont like the dog? :( Also do you just drink youth potions to keep them young enough to have time to complete everything? 
227," He does always incite cheers lmao. He does have a vibe and I really like him. The only thing I hate is that he steals my thunder. As an actress, when Im in public I perform a scene for tips. Well, dummy over there starts inciting cheers and my audience moves to him even though Im global and hes a step below. :/ "
228, Oh thats pretty cool! I dont think Id have the patience for that challenge. 
229," I actually havent played any other sims games. Do they just stop aging when they turn? Can they die from other causes?

Edit: I might like that because I usually just use an abundance of youth potions. "
230," Hes always in the smaller nightclub in my game, so that gives me the idea that hes very humbled. Hes also the first star to even look my way when trying to meet him. I appreciate it. And I think hes bi? Hes just wonderful. Ive met worse celebrities that just give me the talk to the hand thought bubble. "
231, That sounds awesome!! I have 4 kids in one of my saves and they are SO hard to keep up with. 
232, I love this. Good luck to Klotho! So much scandal. Are vampires a fun addition to the game? 
233," I love Thorne Bailey too! My global superstar recently died from hysteria. :( I was treating her too well. I dont know how to cope. The dad isnt in the household, only a male sim I JUST added as a father figure. I want to move the dad in and have a legacy. Im heartbroken. "
234," What is the SuperSim challenge? I havent heard of that one. Also,is Sixam cool? You need an EP for that right? "
235," Im at work so I cant play, but Id love to hear about all of your play styles! Whatcha guys making your Sims do? Tell me all about it. "
236, I was running my diner when Bob and Eliza Pancakes both dropped dead during their meal. My sim hated Eliza so she got a happy buff from her demise. 
237," She died of hysteria. Shes happy about her new baby, the decor in her house makes her very happy, all of her needs were taken care of, she had a bubble bath, and did some playful actions. She just got too playful and died from laughter. :(

Edit: she also ate excellent food and bought new stuff. The materialist trait gave her another happy buff. "
238,  
239, Oh I also let townies in and starve them in their own little rooms. 
240," Sorry for poor quality image. I have a full house of mental hospital patients. I give them a disorder and stereotypical traits to go with it. (Depression; gloomy. Binge eating disorder; glutton. Narcissistic; self assured). They are all erratic. I lock the kitchen for 24 hours or until somebody starves to death. Then I look at who had the most hours to go before they starved to death and play with their genetics, breeding a stronger contestant. 

I have issues and way too much fun. "
241,  
242, Is it on the gallery? :D 
243, I dont get off on ripping my own heart out 
244," I got Get Famous, Dine Out, and Vintage Glamour (I think thats what the stuff pack is called). The idea of getting famous seemed like a really fun storyline Id like to play. I watched a lot of reviews and Im happy with my choice :). Owning a restaurant also is something Id really like to do. Im not crazy about the laundry day idea, so I went with the pack with i butler for my famous chicks. For 10 extra dollars than an expansion pack, my impatience thinks its a good deal. "
245, I went ahead and bought my bundle 
246, I did this while taking baths. I put it all in a cup and pretended to drink it like it was a mixed drink 
247, What was the result? 
248, ... how? 
249, Sometimes a bath just doesnt cut it 
250,  
251, Until the 28th! 
252," Not a problem! I had no idea about the bundles so they were a nice surprise, and no one seems to be talking about them. My advice would be to watch YouTube reviews of the packs so you can see what they offer a little more in depth. "
253," I just got the bundle on Origin. Get Famous, Dine out, and Vintage Glamour stuff (a butler for my famous people sounds wonderful). I havent played any yet, but thats what I did in your situation:D "
254, I hate it 
255," Everyone is complaining. :( I completely get it, dont get me wrong, but so far all Ive had is the base game and I still spend hours on it at a time. I actually bought it on Xbox years ago, just recently downloaded on PC because its free right now and Ive put in 6 hours so far. I get bored playing for long periods of time on Xbox. On PC the introduction of cheats keeps me interested longer. What theyre doing works, and I am falling for it and plan on buying Get Famous. I just like the game and dont mind paying for what I would like to add to the game.  I see where everyone is coming from, and I think I just feel like a dummy for actually buying the base game. "
256, Im in the same boat! I have the naked base game. Need some pizzazz after months of it

293," That its not my fault. In my experience at a bigger one, they play the blame game. They blame you for not getting better. Especially if youre ever re-admitted. A smaller one Ive been to was much much more compassionate. "

301," Thats a good one. Googling something along the lines of reality checks- lucid dreaming will bring up some other good ideas. You could also listen to guided meditations that try to talk you down into lucid dreaming on YouTube. Those dont work for me though.

Edit- I suck at reddit and meant for this to be a comment reply. :( "

355," Medication. Years of therapy. Expensive options, but other than that just mastering coping skills. Knowing yourself and what triggers you. Being triggered isnt a meme, its something you can eventually notice and try to stop while youre ahead. Also, not beating yourself up over thinking youre crazy. So many people struggle with mental health, and its best to learn how to cope with it as best as you possibly can. "

378,  
379, Pens that dont smudge! Please help me out there. My pilot-g2 pens smudge :( 
380," I feel like I need a more complex mood tracker than what Ive seen so far. Maybe a section for contributing factors, and more than just one emotion a day. As for habits, during my first few months I probably wont bother with a habit tracker. I dont have many to keep up with. Im thinking a sleep tracker as well because I sleep far too much and I need to change that. It will be rewarding to see myself getting better on paper. "
381," I dont think Ive ever heard that song, but it sounds like I need to give it a listen. Thats a great quote. 

The only things I plan to use right now are a yearly overview, a monthly, weekly, and definitely a mood tracker. The last thing I want is for it to become a chore. Im going to use the basic system as a guide and set it up in a way that I think will work for me. "
382," Thank you! I think if I feel like its ugly I might get discouraged because everyone elses look so neat and pretty. Im going to start small and simple to avoid that and make sure its a habit I keep and enjoy. I just need some organization and productivity in my life, Im hoping this is it! 

Thank you for the advice :D "
383," Hey all! I have a new journal coming in the mail and I absolutely cant wait for it to get here! I have some questions for you guys. When and how did you start bullet journaling? When did you start becoming happy with your spreads? Also, what tips and tricks would you give someone just starting out? "
384," Best way to get tickets? Not sure, but me and my boyfriend are going in September. Were staying for 6 nights on property, and after looking at the price difference between 4-day tickets and 5-day tickets, we went with the 5-day tickets. I cant remember how much the difference was, but we thought it was worth it. 

2) Again, Ill share my plans. Maybe they can help you out. Were doing a park a day and a second day at magic kingdom. Im not a Star Wars fan, but I definitely want to do Hollywood studios too! Hopefully it shouldnt be super busy in August/September, even with the opening of SW:GE. I would recommend doing a  park a day, and if its in the budget, do a fifth day with the park that peaks your interest the most. All of the parks have a unique feel, and something special to offer. Keep in mind, if you want fast passes (which you definitely do), you have to pick your park days ahead of time. 30 days prior if you stay off of Disney property or 60 days prior on Disney property. 

3) No comment. Were going to magic kingdom on not MNSSHP days so we can stay and see the fireworks without having to pay to stay!

4) also no comment. Im expecting the worst but hoping for the best. You should have no problem getting IN. 

5) Dont want to feed the parks fake? Avoid buying pins in bulk from retail sites like eBay, Amazon. There a YouTube video I actually watched earlier of a girl ordering one to show you what its like and its pretty interesting to see the quality of those compared to real ones. If you cant wait, I would buy some from the official shopDisney site. If you CAN wait, it will probably be cheaper to buy some around Disney Springs and in the parks. 

Sorry if it seems like I made this all about my trip! I just wanted to share how I went about all of it, in hopes to help you out somewhat.  "
385," Girlfriend here, our 4-day trip turned into a 5-day trip after seeing the price difference. I think weve decided 2-days magic kingdom, 2-days Epcot to really absorb all of the fun stuff around the world (and eat our hearts out because of food and wine), and a day at animal kingdom. 

I really like the idea of starting and finishing with Magic Kingdom! Im soo excited and can not stop looking at Disney World stuff.  "
