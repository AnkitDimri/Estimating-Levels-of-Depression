I'll be dammed if a customer treated one of my employees like that and I didn't step in. When I was young, I was just afraid of people. A senior manager would spend time with me, showing me by observation, the different types of aggressive customers and how he would handle different situations with that kind of person. I can't break down exactly how he helped me, but I never forgot him and the feeling that I could handle any unruly customer with confidence.   

You did good! "

301," I know that to be a US president, a person has to be "" a natural born citizen"". That also covers the vice-president. If for some reason neither president nor vice-president are able to fill this position and it goes to the next eligible person (speaker of the house, president of the senate, etc.), does THAT person also have to be native born?  
My son and I have been researching this together. We've spent several days searching and can't seem to get a definitive answer. "

355," Unless you have family or friends willing to help you get out of that hole,  there is no way out. You can't get a job without a residence and you can't get a residence without a job. You can't put your kids in school without a residence, but if you keep them out of school, it's considered neglect and child protective services will take your kids. 

When I was homeless, some shelters wouldn't take us because they said my son was too old and he might molest the little girls (he was 8). 

When going through the orientation for applying for aid, they expected us to be putting in at least 7 job applications daily. When they asked me why I hadn't put any applications in yet, I got angry and said food and shelter for my son were my priority. When I'm angry, my eyes will shed tears and when they saw me ""crying"", they said,  "" You're depressed! "" and sent me to see a shrink. The shrink wrote a prescription for anti-depressants. I told him my depression was situational, not chemical. He said if I didn't take the prescription,  it would be "" non-compliance "" and I would be disqualified from getting aid. 

Without someone to help you, you will never get out of homelessness "

What weapon?!  
A roll of pennies.  
(Nephew helped me roll pennies earlier and I paid him with a roll)  
I told the officer that and even showed him my account number written on it (it was a long time ago). I asked how a roll of pennies was a weapon?!  
He yelled at me,  ""DON'T BE SO FUCKING NAIVE!""

I saw that the kid had a serious case of Impetigo and a very runny nose. He had a lot of snot running out of his nose, coating his mouth and most of his lower face. She glanced down at him, used her hand to squeegee most of the goop off his face and wiped the whole mess onto to edges and handle bar of the shopping cart and continued her shopping.

453," I'm 60 and I'm still not prepared. At 40, after 20 years of an abusive marriage, I got a divorce and then  I was homeless with a 9 year old son. At 45, I was homeless again. At 55, I got sick and had to leave my dream job and now I can't work any more. The only adult thing I learned to do was pay the important bills first , at the beginning of the month...rent, electricity, phone, and car insurance. If I have anything left, I might get some food. After being homeless the second time, I realized all those years of telling myself that things would get better if I tried hard enough to keep my family together, were wasted on a fucking lie. Start teaching yourself to be self-sufficient. The feeling you get from your accomplishments will shape you into an amazing human person. "

464," I will remove my sandals at a friend's house only if they are good friends.    
  
He will be barefoot sometimes at home while I will wear socks because he's from Wales and used to the cold, and I've lived in southern California all my life and am used to warmer temperatures. He thinks it's funny when I say I'm freezing and it's only 55 F.    
  
He will never be barefoot if we have company in our house and he doesn't feel it's proper to be barefoot in someone else's house.    
  
When I used to be more sociable and had regular gatherings at my place,  everyone knew that by the door, when they first came in, they were welcomed to take off their shoes and relax at my place. I used to have quite a large pile of shoes by the door!    
  
Any couples that I used to hang out with, it was always the woman who'd be barefoot most of the time while the men always kept their feet covered in socks or slippers. I think it was embarrassment that their feet had some kind of problem. One had severe bunions, another had the big-toe nails removed, etc.    
  
I hope that answers your questions! "
465, Thank you! 
466, Thank you! 
467, There used to be a website where you could find out the name of a track and the artist by typing in the words from the samples. Does anyone know what I'm talking about? 
468," In my home, I will be barefoot all the time, whether I have guests or not. At their homes, I will show respect and leave socks on. They'll still look at me funny because I wear toe-socks. If it's real cold, I'll wear socks in my house. (oh my god, it's freezing! It's 55F!) That's when he'll be barefoot and I'll have socks on.  
My husband will never have bare feet around anyone else but me, and never at other people's homes. "
469," I have always gone barefoot. I live in southern California and I am much happier when I am barefoot. My husband is from Wales and it took him several years to feel comfortable enough to go barefoot at home. If I have to go out anywhere, then my first choice for footwear will be flip-flops. "
470," I really appreciate your thorough and informative answer. Thank you  
I've have a few encounters with California Myotis and never felt that the bats were anything but healthy. "
471," I'm watching a show about animal infestations and listening to the narrator talking about bats biting people in their sleep. I tried researching how often this is a problem and all I'm finding are references to how many people die of rabies and not answers to my question. I know most bats are insectivores, so I can't imagine why a bat would purposely bite someone in their sleep unless it was sick. It feels like the show is perpetuating an ignorant fear of bats and that is distressing to me because I love bats. People will try to kill any animal that they fear on site out of this ignorance, whether it be bats, opossums, snakes, etc.  

What I'm asking is do bats commonly seek out people sleeping to purposely bite them? "

511," Watching a documentary about the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan, March 11, 2011. There were survivors telling what they saw and how they felt as the tsunami overtook them. Watching helplessly as everything they cared about was destroyed and their neighbors and loved ones die because of these events, and THEY COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT!  

This is how I feel as I watch the destruction of my country. Every day, something else is brought down, rules are changed, the people are changing, and not for the better. Evert day, those in charge become more insanely dangerous. Every day I struggle to push a little spark of panic creeping in my mind deep down or I know it will over-power my thinking. I want to cry because there is nothing I can do but watch it happen.  

And there is NOTHING I can do. I really, really hope that you can. "

A story of a family in a small town that find a young (10 yrs) boy. It seemed that he had been in an accident that left him with no memory. He's reserved, intelligent, has a special connection with animals, and gives the impression that he's not from Earth. His strangeness frightens the locals and I think the military got wind of him and wanted to question him. I think the family that found him wanted to keep him and named him John. His memory returns in time for him to escape our hostile world and go back to his world. I loved this book! I think I was 11 yrs old when I bought it.

914," The girl, who was 11 years old, just learned in school about ""grafting"" done with certain plants and wondered if she could do it, too. Grampa had a huge rose garden with many beautifully colored flowers. Each bush was tagged with it's own unique name like Duet, Lucky Lady and Margaret-something. The little girl took some trimming shears and took a small stem from each bush and with some string, proceeded to tie a stem into a tiny slit made into a different bush. She thought about how surprised Grampa would be to see different colors growing on the same bush! 

After she finished the roses, see looked around and saw the oranges, lemons and tangerine trees. Would it work with them, too? Let's see!

That was fifty years ago and I still feel very guilty about what I did. I was very loved by my Grampa and he only told me how clever I was and spent a long time fixing the roses. The citrus trees he left alone because they seemed to have more fruit that way. I just wondered how people in this community would have reacted in this situation.

Around the time of the Repeat/Threepeat, Chick told in an interview, about the time Jerry West told him about this kid he found named Kobe Bryant. He insisted that Chick come and watch him practice. I remember Chick asking what college he was from and after finding out it was a high school, telling West that acquiring a kid from high school would be a huge mistake. I'm not sure, but I think Chick said they paired Kobe up with Corie Blount and Kobe just blew him and them away. 

I can't remember any more details clearly enough to put into words. I cannot remember who did the interview. I used to have this on VHS, but my Laker video collection was destroyed.

965," Knowing that their father was going to shoot them because I was leaving him and yet he's still part of their lives. All I wanted was my children and to get away. He wanted to take away the only thing I cared about, my children. He went as far as standing over their sleeping bodies with a loaded gun. What held him back was knowing that if he did it, he would have to kill himself also and he lost his nerve. They live on the other side of the states and he moved to the same town to be near them. I will probably never see them again and he sees them any time he wants and he's all over their Facebook and it kills me inside. "
966," Thank you, bot, but it was not a ""what if"" question, an inquiry, nor a request for information. It was more a statement of distress in my mind concerning an artist that I admire. "

1110," 57 yr old female. I'm 5'0"", 200 lbs. Last night I woke up with my eyes and head feeling like I was being violently spun. I grabbed my husband hoping to somehow make it stop, but continued to spin. Even with my eyes closed I could feel the spinning. When I'd open my eyes I couldn't focus on anything because the room seemed to be moving too fast. It lasted about five minutes then start to slow, only to pick up speed again. The longest it has stopped is right now for about a couple of hours. I am extremely susceptible to motion sickness and so there is nausea and vomiting. The spinning is always counter-clockwise.

The last time I ever experienced something close to this was 15 years ago after a lot of drinking of alcohol. I haven't had alcohol since.

I am type II diabetic and have watched my food intake. I take all my meds as prescribed for the past year without problem. I don't feel that I have an ear infection and I don't really have a headache except for the feeling from motion sickness. I am trying to stay hydrated.

meds: Metformin 1000mg 2x daily, Glipizide 10mg 2x, Benazepril 10mg 1x, Gabapentin 300mg 2x

I took a friend, his S.O. and her fourteen year old daughter to Disneyland yesterday. The little girl had never been there before. 

The girl was the typical shy, introverted, almost-goth, quiet kind of person. She still had an aura of innocence that gave no hint of the mental abuse she had suffered from her father. Her mom told me that she was very good at masking her emotions and hardly talked to anyone except to her mother.

Ive been going through some medical issues and have a lot of pain in the lower half of my body and I have to use a cane to walk. We were only going to stay for about five hours because I just didnt think I would be able to do any more than that.

We stayed until closing. 

The joy and wonder in this little girls eyes! Watching her open up so that she was skipping, singing, dancing, and giggling in the streets! Watching her run up to her mom to tell her about something she had seen. Watching her reaction to seeing the Pixar Parade! It seemed like every character acknowledged and waved at her.

My back was hurting and my feet were cramping, but it was so worth it to see how happy this little girl was. She even ran back to my friend and grabbed his hand in order to show him something special, and he told me later that she has never done that before.

I have been to Disneyland (as a guest) hundreds of times and I am still awed by its magic every time.

I wish Walt could have seen her! "

I know my grandmother used a lot of slang. I used to think that the words she used were the proper words for things...Example:

I thought greuda meant nice, long hair, hielo was ice cream, mono meant pretty girl, and everything seemed to be prefixed with ""chingada""... "
1145," In the early 1980s, I bought two decks from a little shop on Olvera Street in Los Angeles. The girl wasn't sure about the deck prices and asked $40 per deck. (I knew they were more like $80 per deck and I asked her if she was sure on the price. She insisted it was $40 and I didn't argue)

I had a messy divorce in 1997 and I'm still finding things I thought were lost forever. I recently found a box of my art supplies and in the box was one of my decks. 

A search only tells me about the Jubilee deck or the mass-produced decks. I remember the deck I bought was a limited edition, but how limited? I have some pics:

They were made in Spain and the edges are 24k gold. They feel amazing to hold and I only use them for special readings.

It was my first day helping out at a Disney-themed store and I was still familiarizing myself with the merchandise. (This store was HUGE!)

A young couple walk up to me and ask if we carry a ""Chewie"" backpack. I'm not sure, so I ask the closest employee, a young girl of about 20 years old. (Me=me, Yg=employee)

Me: ""Do we carry ""Chewie"" backpacks?""

Yg: ""What's a chewie?""

(Me: ?)

Me: ""You know, ""Chewbacca""?""

Yg: ""What's a chewbacca?""

(Me:?!)

The young couple and I looked at each other, wide-eyed, and I said, ""Um, Star Wars?""

She looked at us with no recognition in her eyes. The young couple smiled and walked away. I told the girl thanks anyway and also went on my way.

I caught up with the couple in another aisle and they whispered, ""How could she not know?! How can you grow up in this country and NOT KNOW?!""

I still don't know. "

He and his family are legal immigrants from Lebanon and *nothing* scares him! He's had people try and rob him on occasion, but if he's behind the counter it's guaranteed they will be unsuccessful.

These are two of my favorite stories (I wish you could hear them in his voice!)

I will refer to him as J and customers as TM (troublemakers)

One evening, four, rough-looking guys came in and went straight to the counter to look at the large bottles of liquor on the shelves behind my friend. 

J: Good evening! May I help you?

TM: Yeah... how much is that bottle? (TM then pulls out a huge belt knife and uses it to point to the largest bottle on the top shelf.) His friends are trying to muffle their laughter.

J ( who then pulls out his .44 S W out of his waistband and points it to the same bottle): You mean this one, here?

He said the instant silence was priceless! TM mumbled something and they quickly left.

Another time, close to closing, another TM came in and quickly pulled out a handgun, went to the counter and said, "" Quick, old man, give all your money in the drawer!"" J stays calm with the gun pointed at his head, and says, "" Okay...okay...Let me get it for you.""

J opens the till, calmly takes out all the bills, stacks them into one pile and sets it on the counter directly between them. When TM shifts his eyes to look at the stack of money, J snatched the gun right out of TM's hand and begins to examine it. 

J: You didn't really plan this very well, did you? You know, you could have pawned this for a lot more than what's in that pile right there. (vaguely points the gun at TM) I think you should just leave right now before something bad happens, yes?

I loved hearing him tell me his stories!



edit 1: Those of you who've asked for more stories of ""J"", I will. Some asshole broke my pc and I've only had my phone to do this, so it might take me a few of days. 

I will tell ""J"" of his fans at reddit!



edit 2: apparently this post was accidently deleted because it was two stories in one post. Right after I split them into two seperate posts, a mod found it and put it back up! 

So, if you see the other two, please don't be cross that they are the same stories...I'm just too tired to take them down. I will be posting a couple more soon...

1164," Back in the late 1980s, I worked for a large chain of craft stores. One of my co workers was a sweet, funny, cute young man who was born with a birth defect which caused one of his arms to end just below his elbow joint. Believe me though, he was in no way handicapped. He was one of the best workers we had! There was not any task that he couldn't do. We both had a bit of a mean streak when it came to obnoxious people and their evil children!

On the days that he was on register, he would get a kick out of the reactions when people saw his arm and their surprise,  confusion and discomfort as they tried to figure out how not to hurt his feelings. He would make sure he wiggled it close to them as much as possible. He would also hand them their bags with his stump so they would have to *touch* it! We got really good at keeping a neutral expression. Kids, though, would really embarrass their parents with their wide-eyed, gaped-mouthed, look of shock. The kids would just say, loudly, ""MAMA! LOOK AT HIS ARM! WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?!""

Our store was in an area with a large Mexican-American community. My friend would lean close to the kid with his arms extended on the counter (mere centimeters from the kid's nose!) and he'd say,

""You know when you're outside playing and your mom calls you in because it's getting late? And how sometimes you don't want to because you're having fun with your friends? Did your mom tell you about the Cucuy? Well, I didn't want to listen to my mom and I was walking kinda slow when, real quick, the Cucuy jumped out of a shadow, grabbed me and BIT OFF MY ARM!""

I wonder how many kids he traumatized for life that way? "

1215," Southern California is too expensive and crowded for my daughter, so she and her husband are moving to Ohio to start their own family. 

My son will be 21 in a few weeks and he and his girlfriend have been offered a job (that includes room and board) in Oregon. 

My son leaves today, and my daughter in a few days.

I only found out a couple of weeks ago. I haven't had time to process the idea. Of course, I know this is what is supposed to happen. I know that both have a great opportunities and great adventures waiting to be experienced. I am trying to be encouraging, but inside I am screaming with grief and panic, thinking of life from now on without them.

I can't help feeling that I will never see them again.

1217," My cousin, a christian with a great love of God, had her daughter suffer with cancer. The day the doctors told her that there was no hope, she and family and friends did a huge power-prayer vigil, hoping for a miracle. 

The next day the doctors told her that they didn't know how, but her daughter was cancer-free and that they would be taking her off the ventilator! Everyone was jubilant! The power of prayer!

24 hours later, the girl died.

This has shaken the faith of a lot of people, including the mother. 

How do christians help people like this? What can you say to a mother who loses her only daughter and now questions her reasons for loving a God who would allow her daughter to suffer, then experience joy, then die? "

1220," I just wanted to tell you that I feel such emotion to see folks here are some of the most caring and responsible pet owners I have ever encountered! 

Most people don't ever think to learn about their pet's nutrition, habits, health or emotional needs, but YOU people!...you are amazing!

It hurts me inside when I see people acquire an animal in total ignorance and then watching it suffer through neglect. I told my kids that if they wanted *any* pet, they would have to become an expert on that animal and prove that they could be a responsible owner before I would consider allowing it.

(at one time we had a very happy and harmonious household consisting of: 2 rats,4 cats, 2 dogs, 2 cockatiels, 1 desert tortoise)

AND all our animals got along with each other!

What's the intro going to be like with Disney in charge? If it's going to be the traditional Disney intro, I feel that's it going to be a let-down. (I've tried splicing them together, hoping I can still feel the same excitement)

I remember the time was to be 3:30pm. I was in grade school and we were so scared that the school let us stay in the auditorium until the predicted time passed and we could go home. A lot of people moved out of state or took their family vacation before that day...just in case.

There was even a song on the radio that made fun of the prediction:

1245,  
1246," Hi, people!

I am 55 yrs old, live in southern California and I haven't had dental insurance (hence dental work) in over 8 years. I do brush and floss several times a day, but sometimes there are things beyond my control and I need medical/dental attention.

Over the past 8 years, I've had 2 teeth break off at the roots (roots are still in my gums), several old fillings fall out, one loose tooth that was hanging on by one root (Tooth #2) that I had to extract myself after weeks of pain, and now tooth #18 has become loose and abcessed. It happened a few month ago and when the side of my face swelled up, my mother took me in to emergency. They pushed on it, got some of the infection to drain, gave me a perscription for antibiotics and told me to keep trying to drain it myself. My bill is $500 that I have absolutely no way of paying.

The infection is back and all I know to do is brush, floss, antibacterial mouthwash, and gum massage to hopefully strengthen the roots. The clinic here has a 6 month waiting list for the assessment before any work is done (they don't do emergency extractions) and I still have 5 months to go.

Some people have told me that I could actually die from the infection! What can I do? Beyond rent, utilities and gas for my car to get to and from work, I have no extra money. I don't have a bank account or savings...I have nothing of value to pawn or sell...I don't even know what will happen to my body if I die since there's no money for a burial.

Sorry about the length!

1249," I've been happily vaping for a few months. Right now my battery is an Ego-C twist 1000 mAh and I'd like something that hold a charge longer than 4 hours. I'm starting to find myself timing my outings by the length of charge left (or turning it down in hopes it will last longer). Sometimes, I won't leave the house unless I have a full charge (which means I am often late for certain engagements).

Do I just buy a spare to have handy in case my battery dies, or can you recommend something that can last at least a day? Do they make batteries that will last that long? I like going to Disneyland, but I don't want to leave just because my battery ran down before I did!...or does it sound like I just have a problem hitting the juice too often?

My tank is an iclear-30.

Thanks! "
1250,  
1251," I've only had it a month.

Do I have to buy a new tank, or can I buy a replacement base? Any suggestions what to look for and where to buy from? It seems wasteful to throw the whole tank out. 

My eyesight isn't the best and I can't see if anything is wrong with the connection point other than it isn't connecting when I screw it onto the tank.

Also, does turning up the voltage on an Ego twist deplete the charge faster? I hate it when the battery dies and I'm not near my charger!

Thanks for any help you can give me! "

The video is just a still shot. I have yet to find a video that describes the feeling this music evokes in me. I will instead describe my son's experience as described to me...

He was riding his bike on a trail lined with trees as this tune started to play. the trail was not straight and caused a slight to-and-fro sway. As the music built up, he found himself on a slight rise and had to pump with a little more force. When the kick came, he crested the rise and saw a low wall to one side covered in children's drawings. The trail started a downhill decline and he stopped pedaling and coasted. A butterfly flew in front of him and led him for a way. The tune ended.

I couldn't stop crying when he played this piece as he described his experience to me.

This chokes me up more than any part of the movie! 

It makes me feel the emotion of reuniting with my cousin when he returned from Desert Storm, whole in body, but with hurt in his soul and mind.

My other cousin who was my best friend from the time I was born. He moved away when I was 6 yrs old and I found him again when I was 18. We had been as close as Celie and Nattie were, and our reunion was just as emotional as this.
