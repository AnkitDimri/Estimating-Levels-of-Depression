3, Sex is just an invention created by the Illuminati so that we don't pay attention to their schemes because society is focusing on sex. The asexual community is actually the people rising and realizing the TRUTH 
4, oof I got almost everything wrong 
5, I'm talking about sexuality 
6," Please put an ""other"" option in the sexuality part "
7," I've been questioning this a lot lately. I had my first crush when I was 13 after knowing this boy for almost 1 year and exchanging a bunch of secrets and feelings whit them. I lately discovered that most people experience romantic attraction when they're 5(????)
I had another crush after a while, in my best friend.
Since then, I hadn't had any crushes and I found really hard to like someone. And I honestly don't know if everybody is like this, I've always thought so, until one day I was talking whit my sister and I mentioned how I only fall in love after knowing the person really well, and she looks and says ""Oh, I'm sorry to break it to you, but you've never really fell in love"" and I got really confused



Sorry for any broken English, it's not my first language and I'm not sure if everything is correct in this text, thanks "
8," when I was on third grade I used to pretend that I liked this guy because I thought I was ""supposed to"" and everyone else also choose their crush. I met him again years later and he asks ""Do you remember you had a crush in me?"" and I answered ""Uhhhh..... yes, I guess...."" "
9," when a friend showed me a photo of a guy whitout a shirt saying ""ISN'T HE HOT??"" and my reaction was ""Ew, please put a shirt on"" "

25," Only sex repulsed aces, like me, feel bad. Ask him if he's comfortable! You are already being amazing for worrying "
26," how did she confuse ""not feeling attraction to anyone"" and ""feeling attraction to everyone""? "
27, I'm really happy with all the support I'm getting here! Thanks guys! 3 
28," It is simple ignorance, he didn't said to hurt me, he might even said that as something that it's great. And it's definitely not worth the effort to try educating him, he can be hard to talk to "
29," He doesn't try to understand a lot of things, unfortunately "
30," I'm very sex repulsed. Today, he was talking about sex and I asked him to stop, then he looks at me and says ""You know, I really wished I could talk about these stuff around you. But don't worry, you'll grow out of it"". We're friends for about a year now and he was there when I came out (I was going to come out only to my best friends, but he was there and I didn't really cared). He's not very aware of what asexuality is exactly, and I'm pretty sure he assumes is sex repulsion,based on the way he talks about it(he never mentions attraction). I felt kinda bad and just wanted to tell someone, thanks for reading. "
