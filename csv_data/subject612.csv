1," well i can tell you this story :) 
When I started the quivalent of highschool in my country, I'd decided that I didn't want to fall in love AT ALL. I had had too much heartbreak (for example: you're not thin enough to be my gf sorry). So well I started talling with this guy that was in my class and he was my bestfriend. Really I felt so good with him but remember, I didn't want any relationship so I decided that I wasn't in love. 
A couple months later, I was talking with his bestfriend (C), who became mine later, and she told my that he had told her that he really liked a girl in his class with whom he was talking a lot. I thought a bit about that and I realized I was the only girl in our class with who he was talking. 
A couple weeks after, I was still thinking about that and I realized that I was in total love with him. 
So, of course, I told my now bestfriend (C) something like ""Fuck I think I am in love with him"", to what she answered ""Fuck, he is in love with you too"" 
At this moment, she decided to tell him, so that he will have the guts to ask me out. 
He dared 
We are happily together for nearly 2 years 3
