0," Damn. Yes, come on in "
1, Yes please!! 
2,  
3, Amen  
4, YES 
5, Why is this so funny to me?  
6, Happy birthday  
7, Would marry her on the spot  
8," You know what I did? Just stopped going on dates and focused on myself. I realized I needed that time for me. Now I can slowly give a little bit of me to other people, and know that whoevers willing to really take the time to get to know me, is worth my time and effort. 
But I still think someday, there will be one person that will just come and youll be able to be yourself and give all you got without even thinking about it. 
Happy Im not the only one feeling like this! "
9," Yes! and then you wonder if it will ever work out again, because you know, you are just too tired to put in that initial and essencial effort required to get to know someone "
10," I feel like that too. Sometimes I feel tired to give myself and learn about the other person. Like after so many incompatibilities, you just get tired to go through all of that every time you get a chance with a new person "
11," Never be afraid to do whats best for you. It might hurt, but you need to be happy! One day at a time, you have here all the support you need  "
12, One big hug coming right now  
13," Thats was so kind and cute, thank you so much I guess youre right, its just that sometimes people make comments, like her shoulders are bigger then mine (specially guys), like thats a big problem. And I know deep down, there are some girls how think the same way. And I guess that makes me a little insecure, because it goes against what is normal for a girl "
14, Thats all we want  
15, Why the sun? Throw yourself at a girl!! 
16," Right?? Its a big plus 
I just love girls "
17," Thats true, and thank you! "
18, Yeah me too! 
19," Its actually great for your mental health. Ive dealt with a lot too, and this was something that always helped me clear my mind, even if it was just when I was there.
I havent found one yet  "
20," YES, thank you  "
21, What about the other 67%? 
22, Wow  
23, Thank you! I just joined! 
24," And thats sad, that we live in a world like that "
25, Well probably none! But Ill keep you updated  
26, You are? Thats so awesome! Its good to have some support 
27, Ill take it  
28," Thats was very useful! Thank you, I would give you a hug right now "
29," Im very shy too, but it would be so much easier if girls said look, Im interested in you "
30, Now I never will! Im already flustered  
31, Ahahah that would be no problem! 
32," Dont be! 
maybe youre not doing what youre supposed to or not doing what is better for your body, and thats why you find it so difficult "
33, Thank you so much  
34, Did you like it? Its pretty cool 
35,  
36," Thank you, its so good to know  "
37," I will, thank you  "
38," I find that attractive too
Yeah, go for it! "
39," Ahahahah its so good to know, really, you have no idea 
I get distracted with girls in general "
40, I will 
41," Dance is a very complex thing too so, I believe it, dancers are very very very sexy. I kinda wish I had one "
42," There must be other things we cant do, and we must ask you to... like grab things under furniture 

See? We still need help "
43, Yeah shes so beautifuuuuul  
44, Wow thank you so much  
45, So hot. And similar 
46, Ill train with you then 
47, Really??? Thats actually one of my goals! 
48, I wish they did! But thank you! 
49, I like that a lot. Is there any way for me to see you lifting? 
50," True, I like the way you think "
51, Ahah I can relate to that! 
52, Girls are hot. 
53," Thats so cute, but if it was me, I would probably be more flustered than you

Oh wow thank you so much! "
54," Thats still cool! I love and appreciate all kind of bodies, and hey, small girls and thin bodies are beautiful too! "
55," I feel the same way, but I dont know why, sometimes I get self conscious
And thank you! "
56," Yeah, thats what I though! but sometimes people tend to say bad things about it. And I was like is this something girls appreciate in other girls? , so thank you!! "
57," For real, 
Ive always been kind of insecure because of my body. I did acrobatic gymnastics for 18 years (Im 22) and I always loved sports, so I was very active. I still am, I work out every day and Im studying to become a personal trainer. 
When I was younger, my weight was a big problem, and now, sometimes I think Im too muscular for girls to like me. 
Idk, just want your real opinions on this "
58," I think Ill go, just to be sure.  
Thanks again, really! "
59, Thank you so much! 
60," Theres a big blister on the side. (I will put a link where you can see it better).
I was getting a little concerned because it hurts when I move my finger, and in some spots feels kinda numb. 
I forgot to tell the details, but I was cooking and I spilled boiling water on my hand.

Thank you so much!
