Here's the basics of how it works. Just looked it up myself and it's interesting. You can do it with a decent ham radio. Go try it and see what you think. You can use it to pick up long distance radio signals from other places on the globe. Kinda neat. "
1, Almost all of these I have multiple answers that apply but i can only choose 1. For instance i watch documentaries on YouTube AND streaming services 
2," True. Mostly saying that if you say no to the first question you still may be interested in the product, but the survey says skip to the end if it's a no. "
3, Link to the survey? 
4, If this is only for current houseplant owners you should mention that in your title. Also note I currently do not own a indoor houseplant because I have difficulty keeping them alive which may actually be a niche for you as well. 
5, Or a pit orchestra 
6," If someone makes a meat alternative that has a similar or better eating and prep experience (taste, smell, texture, ease of cooking/flavoring) at a same or cheaper price point I will happily never eat meat again. But honestly I'm not that swayed by cow emotional capability. I already know pigs are smart and empathetic and I eat them without issue. I'm better swayed by ecological or economic impact, but that economic benefit needs to pass on to the consumer too (which I realize currently is an issue of infrastructure, demand, and novelty) "
7, Pst... Look at the question that's the title of this post.

10," Some background real quick: My game's a modern (1999) set game with secret cabals using magic and legendary creatures/myths to influence and control various societies. My PCs have wandered into Sedona, AZ which is controlled by a group of 3 witches using a combination of transmutation/animal control, diseases/necromancy, general scrying and sympathetic magic for a general racketeering and blackmail scheme where local businesses pay ""protection money"" through offerings. The witches themselves hide behind proxies/minions, and the PCs don't know everything going on yet.


Any ideas for flavorful events/encounters to hint at the witches control. So far they've investigated a series of animal infestations that forced the health department to shut down businesses and destroyed an extremist church (that was harboring/training a witch hunter that may be an obstacle/reluctant ally). I also plan on a proxy trying to steal hair clippings/blood/etc in some way. Any ideas of similar surreal events/counter attacks/etc from the witches? Ideas for their lair(s)/front businesses/other mafia-like activities would be appreciated as well.

TLDR: I want ideas for witch lead mafia encounters set in modern times. Surreal/spooky appreciated. "
11, Might have answered my own question. I found on the [kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonofoak/nights-of-payne-town-a-new-story-arc-for-city-of-m/posts/2480468) update it's saying end of may hopefully. 
12, I preordered about a month ago. No word from Sons of Oak and the website still says they're due in April. Is there an announcement somewhere I missed? 
13," The OneShot podcast did a series where they played a scenario with some of the pre-gens. I liked it's blend of fate and PbtA as well as the setting and now I'm playing a game with regular group, though it's gotten decidedly not city based by virtue of their world creation in our first session. "
14, Reminds me of shredder from TMNT. Looks great! 
15," Nice, that was actually a strategy I was thinking of. Thanks for the answer "

17, Can you not aim the dog for the dog drop? That move seems much less worth it if you cant aim(from a foot above  obviously) 
18, Yep. Including pawns.  
19," Personally I agree with OP, I've done both off and on through my life and always feel better eating junk. I get depressed and angry pretty frequently when dieting (no matter what form that takes) and often crash out after about 1-3 months in. It's gotten to the point that I'm scared to diet cause I feel so horrible and feel like I have to sleep all day (though I'm doing well on my current plan so far). I've never felt better eating healthy than when I eat whatever I want other than very short term stuff like feeling over full or something. I wish more than anything else that I did feel better on a calorie deficit, that's why it's so hard to do.

Similarly, I've been lifting for about 6-7 years and very rarely feel good from workouts, but I continue cause I like the results (getting stronger) and sometimes I feel accomplished.  Overall, it's very much a chore and not ""fun"". Again, I'd love it if I got some sort of high from working out, but doesn't seem in the cards for me. "
20," With any tougher cut with lots of connective tissue/collagen you will render that tough stuff into gelatin making it much more tender. Basically anything you'd cook low and slow via another method (smoking/braising). With sous vide though you can do much lower temps, though you'll have to go longer in the bath. Basically longer=more collagen break down=more tender. There's gonna be limitations and preferences as with anything else obviously. Some people like 12 or 24 hour short ribs, others shoot for 48-72, but there will be texture differences with each level. "
21," Was deciding this myself. Besides what the other guy said, I just wanted to note that you can get a few bucks off if pre-ordering both off the city of mist store (it's 30 for both pdfs). "
22, Oh. Awesome. I guess I should have done a quick look before asking.  
23," Hi, I'm looking to start up a new game soon online with some friends and was wondering what people use online for keeping track of all the statuses, story tags, etc etc. Any particular virtual tabletops/programs/whatever people have found effective?

24, MDIC! 
25," I really like your foam rocks and snow and shrubbery. I dont love that dang tree kinda pulls me out of it. Just looks faker than the rest. 

Also, minor, but some of the smaller rocks kind of merge into the base part of the foam. Maybe carve in a little more or add snow or dirt or something to add a little contrast and delineate the small rocks better.  "

29," Which would put you, I'd guess, over 45 as it came out 39.5 years ago.

I've seen it, but only due to it being featured on MST3K. Also a few years after The Island came out so age seems irrelevant. "
30, Pst.... That movie's actually 40 years old. I'm sorry for you loss.

69," So I have a basement office in our town home and despite what temperature the house is it gets pretty cold. Normally I actually enjoy this, but in the winter it can get a bit ridiculous so I'd bundle in blankets and things.

70, You're saying this youtube is HAUNTED?!~ 
71," Homing missiles on the Inquisitor are a bit unnecessary as you already have a pretty strong attack from  range 2-3. Prockets can be nice as they discourage people getting in real range 1 of him. Lone wolf is usually redundant as you'll probably be TLing every round anyways and you cant Errol twice. PTL or juke both work well instead. Autothrusters are nice as well if you have them or maybe stealth device if you don't. 

If you're doing Ryad with a cannon put the TIE/D title on. Or drop the cannon and put on TIE/x7 which she excels with. Consider Vessery for TIE/D builds as his ability works well with it and he synergises well with others wanting TLs like inquisitor (though you have to not use it before he gets to go, VI can help). Marksmanship works okay for TIE/D due to the double attackbut if you go x7 predator or PTL gets more mileage.  "

The subreddit has helped me fuel my obsession building new lists and checking out new strategies, builds, tutorials, repaints etc. Overall it's been great to have a subreddit that helped pull my attention over constantly reading toxic political threads which I had gotten stuck doing constantly with the election.

So I just realised I have a Barnes and noble gift card with about $40 on it from Christmas and figured it's a good way to throw some money at xwing without feeling like I'm actually spending anything. 


So, what should I spend it on? Currently leaning toward a large ship, either a scum ship or one of the yt-1300 options. Also maybe a quad jumper cause they look fun. Any suggestions? Willing to spend a little more than the $40 potentially

95," Hi everybody,

After playing a few times I took the plunge and bought somebody's pretty sizeable used collection on eBay. A buddy is coming over this weekend and I was wondering if any of you wonderful people have fun lists using these ships or basic ship combos that are fun to try out. Fun/interestingcompetitive in general. 


Here's the ships:

3 tie Fo

3 tie fighters

3 tie interceptors

1 tie bomber

1 tie punisher

1 tie phantom

1 tie defender

1 tie advanced

1tie advanced prototype

1 firespray 31

1 lambda class shuttle

1 yt 2400 freighter

2 b wings

1 k wing

1 a wing

2 y wings

1 e wing

2 x wings

1 t70 x wing

1 hwk 290

3 z 95 head hunters

1 m3a interceptor


This includes one of each starter, an imperial and a rebel aces set, and Most Wanted. 

Thanks guys, and sorry for such a vague/daunting task, I'm just a bit overwhelmed and thought the Reddit hivemind might already have some good ideas.  "
96, Looks great! It's like in game when it moves from your normal walking model to a pre-rendered cutscene. 
97, I have not seen that one. Source?

99," Not to nitpick too much, but West Point is free to any who are accepted (plus I think you get a stipend). That said, it is an incredibly rigorous and selective school. "
100," Doing a wash will certainly help give some definition. Also, not using absolute pure white except for some highlights. Mix in some light grey. 


All being said, I like the lab rat idea for a Skaven blood bowl team. Personally I'd try and find/modify a mini to look like brain to add to the team, or at least for the sidelines as a coach or something. (Disclaimer: I know very little about blood bowl. ) "
101," May want to read the title again.  There's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8U0IaMsRf4) of him boasting of it, whether he actually assaulted people or not is not contained in that headline. "
102,  
103," I like the irony of the composition of these photos. It shows a picture of several ""liberals"" having all sorts of different reactions during some sort of protest and labels them as all the same. Then it says conservatives just want you to think, but shows all the ""conservatives"" striking one of two poses. Not exactly an image of thinking for oneself. "
104," The heavy metallic look gives a bathysphere vibe to the TIE cockpits. Almost steampunk. Probably not my thing for imperials, but I do like it.   "
105," Just bought a pretty sizable fleet off of ebay to get into this(30 small ships 3 large), and I've been looking for storage solutions so this is great!


Looking into the 1374 plano, I keep seeing reference to finding them for 20-30 bucks. Has anyone gotten them that cheap? Best I can find online is like 45ish. Is that a price at some brick and mortar store or do I just need to wait for an online deal? "

It doesn't necessarily mean the person is racist, but it does mean the action they took is based in racial prejudice.

116," Find out, after the break! "
117," No worries, I get you.  I know you weren't really trying to be a dick about it. I just thought it was funny saying this judgment is not elitist while at the same time saying they've probably only had shitty, cheap, or badly prepared steaks. You see the elitism there right?  "

143," Who are invariably princes, so feel free to kiss them to turn them back. "
144," I understand your point, though I feel it would be hard to hit much of a bottleneck unless you were doing some very heavy handed selection. For instance, if we were just selecting for autism it would have a very negligible effect unless autism confers some sort of immunity or survival advantage currently unknown. Depends on the depth we are going here. If you're going for a ""completed version of humanity"" then you are indeed likely to hit a bottleneck. But seeing that I can't see a way this would be possible on any sort of species wide scale, I doubt it matters if the completed guys get wiped by future malaria or something similar. 

So while I feel that for the theory of eugenics the bottleneck may be the strongest argument but for implementation, I doubt it would be much of a hurdle as long as you controlled for it. Social and political issues I feel would be a far bigger obstacle for actual implementation because populations wouldn't accept it. That is of course is all speculation though and depends on a myriad of details. But either way we can agree to disagree. 

Btw I'm not particularly pro or con for eugenics, just offering a Hitler-free counter argument of the first thing that came to my head. Also, not angry at all, so I hope it didn't come off that way. 
 "
145," By the time we understand all that I feel like we'll be able to simply use gene therapy to change anything disease related in the genome. I feel that'd be a more ethical way of doing it than classic breeding eugenics, though it could still be abused obviously if this was authoritarian state enforced, etc "
146," We were talking about the movie idiocracy in this case which is a movie that assumes the premise that intelligence is pretty much entirely heritable and the unintelligent outbreed the smart. 

I see where you are coming from for your concept and do not disagree completely, but currently it would be entirely uninforcable without some extreme authoritarian government overhaul. 

Also, we don't understand genetics nearly enough to be effective at this. Epigenetics, or how environment including diet, stress levels, etc effect gene expression, is just starting to be understood and is a huge component of how complex genes function. Similarly, gene therapy is becoming more reliable. If we can just turn a gene off or control its expression for a genetic disease why bother sterilising the individual?  "
147," My personal opinion is more that I don't trust the people in power to make a utopia or to share goals with the general populace. I also don't think you can breed a utopia cause behaviour, I feel, is weighted a bit more toward nurture than nature, especially with factors like epigenetics where it's nurture effecting nature. 

Genetic bottleneck would be somewhat hard to come by unless we're talking about some very extreme eugenics here. Are you talking about breeding humans to the level we do for dogs where individuals are assigned mates and/or are likely to be somewhat incestuous? Or just light eugenics like manditory abortion of people with certain genetic/developmental disorders (which was my assumption due to the context of this thread)? It's unlikely the latter would cause much of a bottleneck. I like that it's arbitrarily the ""best"" argument according to you though just because it's the one you most agree with.  "
148, I've seen enough smart people make idiot children and vise versa to think that you can fully breed idiocy out of a population. Seems more nurture than nature to me.  
149," Never heard of it. 

Seriously though, this I guess could be a weird sarcastic statement but I see no indication of that. More likely it's a troll and/or a mid to late teenager with ""edgy"" ideas IMO. On the off chance they were serious I spent two minutes giving a non-Hitler answer.  "
150," Well, the most basic reason not to support eugenics is the general human rights issue of not allowing a basic function of life (reproduction) for consenting individuals based on whatever criteria those in power decide upon. If you're not the one determining the criteria that's a scary thing and easily abused. In terms of racial or even demographic based eugenics (AKA Jewish people and folks with autism can't breed and must be castrated) it is basically a form of genocide, albeit a bit less direct.  "
151, Hah. Nice ending zinger!

180," I used to have arguments with a woman's studies major on facebook similar to these, though slightly better backed up. There seems to be a SWJ movement to revert to a small community, tribal ""anarchism"" where everyone would just be responsible and have tons of free time somehow. She basically said it could only happen after a semi-apocalyptic situation or revolution which killed off most of the population (and what she was rooting for). She said laws would be unnecessary cause basically community opinion/implied mob rule would hold everyone in check. When I asked about what she thought would happen when the neighboring tribe that found an old military depot came through conscripting and enslaving her tribe with superior force she had no answer and ended up very mad at me. I gave up on the arguing cause it was too deep and now I just post crazy articles she puts up here on TIA periodically.  "

I knew a guy like this in college. Roommate turned arch-nemesis due to reasons unrelated to the story.

In order to ""help"" her overcome some issues with negative behaviors  she had he would withhold sex and/or affection. Really, just an awful person. "

218," Totes jealous, but congrats on all the success. 

I cook and like healthy food in general (as well as unhealthy ones). Just seem to crash and burn after about 20-30 days of dieting (up til then I'm usually happy and fine), then all the sudden I just want to sleep like 12h a day and not do anything productive. That's when I get crazy needs for junk food and weird stuff like anger responses to smells food that's not what I want. I feel like some sort of out of control animal rather than my normal self.  It always seems like I have the opposite reaction as everyone else too, food cravings and emotional stuff is always fine for the month or so and then I just go crazy with it. I don't seem to really get hungry at any point, just cravings for specific nonsense. I lift, walk and dance regularly for the past 5y whether dieting or not. I'm a chiropractor with a B/S in biochem as my undergrad so it's especially frustrating to me as I know the science and studies and strategies that are successful for high percentages of people, but it doesn't seem to work for me thusfar.

Sorry to vent weirdly. It's honestly the biggest stressor in my life now that I'm out of school so it somtimes wears on me a lot. "
219," I get depressed after about a month of dieting (so far every strategy I've tried that has worked has lead to this in the past 5 years, and its the only time I'm ever depressed). Still a lame excuse and it's not stopping me from trying, but I honestly have a bit of a fear response to it and that stops me from moving forward with weight loss. I end up not really being able to function though and it continues until about 10 days after I start eating junk again, so until I can find a way around that I'm probably staying bigger than I'd like to be unfortunately. Not one who usually buys into food addiction junk, but honestly I don't know what else may be going on. Done supplementation and lab tests and shit, so far no insight from that.  "
220," Oh yeah, gotcha. You can certainly do that but it's not entirely fat loss (mostly water) and usually not a permanent or sustainable change. 

Wrestling is kinda notorious for causing eating disorders and stuff. I work out with a few HS wrestlers from time to time and hear this stuff constantly. "
221," Well, you understand that you can increase the calories spent and achieve a difference there as well, correct? That part is usually done via exercise.  "
222," Right, it's possible, just not gonna work for everyone or even probably like 20% of people. That's all I meant, and that usually the problems more with diet rather than lack of motion. That's a crazy amount from just workouts in a month btw. Glad it worked for ya! Mind if I ask what you did?

Edit: Just to clarify. The ideal is to do BOTH diet and exercise obviously. Studies mostly show diet works better for loss if used exclusively, but people who exercised as well had an easier time sustaining their weight loss afterword. "
223, First guy did. I assumed you were in the same boat as I thought it was implied by your response. My bad I guess.  
224," Eh, no offence but you're pretty wrong about minimal exercise being the only thing you need. My guess is while you eat ""bad things"" you're still only around your bMR. Most experts say it's gotta be at least 80% diet to get weight loss results. Admittedly my diet is probably even shittier than yours, but I've been walking 2mi with my dog for 5 years, doing heavy lifting with a trainer 3x per week for 3 years, and ballroom dancing about 3-5h per week for the past year with my wife. While this has certainly lead to me becoming much stronger/graceful/able in general, I've still gained about 60lbs in those five years. High stress of my school drove me to some bingey behaviours and I still haven't really beaten them now that I've graduated. If just a tiny amount of exercise works for you then that's awesome, but if most people won't change diet too then nothing will really happen for them.  "

295," Or it's taking into account situations where people are driving under the speed limit but there is still a pace of traffic. There's just different options. Like if most people were driving the speed limit  (say 55) and one guy wanted to go 50, then he better be in the right lane. That's all the law said. Same works if, say due to traffic, the average speed is 35 in this 55 speed zone and one guy is in a tractor or is hauling something so he's wanting to do 30 or something. He should stay in the right lane again. In that situation, no one is speeding and the law still makes sense and is adapted to the situation by that language. All I'm trying to say is that the two laws are completely independent, and the phrasing is to be a catch all including going below the speed limit and thus doesn't suggest that people are ""supposed to be speeding"" though it would also include if they were I guess, though then the speeding laws would also be in effect. 

Blah blah blah, semantics and stuff. "
296," Heh, could be. Don't know if that means you're ""supposed to speed"" though

Edit: Didn't see the re-posted Oregon statute. See my above statement on that if you want. "
297," This was not a question anyone asked as far as I know. I was just talking about the basic speed limit laws. If you were supposed to speed why would there be speed limit laws? The question you posed earlier of why there would be slow traffic on the right laws if we weren't supposed to speed is moot as people driving below the speed limit would still be held to that law without also having to break another law (IE you can follow that one or break that one with no speeding involved by either party). 

That curve is interesting and was a cool thing to learn, but is not really relevant. According to that chart average speed is better than both slow or fast so if the hypothetical ""person going slow in the left lane"" was going the average speed then they are a safer driver than the individual wanting to go faster behind them. Just depends what the average speed is, which we do not know in this situation we're discussing. "
298," It's a speed limit not a speed mandate. You can go *under* the limit as much as you want, as long as you aren't obstructing or going below a minimum. (Or maybe you were being sarcastic, can't read tone). "
299," I like sauteing veggies and/or veggie noodles and finishing it in a curried coconut milk kinda sauce.

356," Yeah, need them n-3 meats/eggs/fish. But she's doing what she can on the budget she has I think. Better than nothing. "
357, You can also ask him any questions you have. Any good doc will be happy to explain things to anyone interested. 
358," What game system? (or which version of Dnd)? Classically in like pathfinder and 3.0-3.5 here's the stats. Only real useful if poisoned, or maybe for sneak attacks and stuff. Hope that helps.

361, I love that other people see these things too... 
362, Thanks! I'll try keeping these things in mind more.  
363," Sorry if I'm being kinda contrary, just a little frustrated with it all. I do appreciate the advice  "
364," I've thought the same along the energy lines and run several blood panels. Metabolic/lipid, a pretty complete thyroid panel, and some other stuff. Only thing that ever comes up is slightly high cholesterol. I've done some elimination diets cutting gluten and milk and some other stuff for a few mo and then re-challenged with no real effects (same with simple sugars for a general dysbiosis sorta test.)

My family's not too overweight, and they do have healthy stuff in addition I just tend to fall into the trap.  

I don't have to eat in the car, I just end up buying ice cream cause it's on the way and I feel stressed and talk myself into it. Doesn't seem to matter if I'm full or anything like that either. I rarely get hungry at all, just cravings for specific things.  I generally eat similar to what you're talking about , I just also get ice cream or soda a few times a week (or more if tests, or less if I can force myself).  I know how to eat well, just not how to not eat bad stuff in addition. 

I'm trying to lifestyle, but I've found if I set limits I can stick to eating well for longer. I'd much rather adopt it to a lifestyle change, but it hasn't be something I've been able to manage so far. "
365," I am down about 10lbs currently, and have been down as much as 39lbs in the last 2 years, but I bounce around a lot. Also some lean mass addition as I've been working out quite a bit in this time.  "
366," Chiro student here. Which makes it worse, cause I'm well aware of what I'm doing to myself but still can't stop it. :\  

While I don't buy anything bad to keep in the house, I do tend to buy food to eat in the car during my commute (often ice cream things). Probably my main source of bad food is me actively seeking it, which is what bothers me about it as I can't seem to stop for long. I split my time between my family home and my fiance's apartment (and school). While my fiance usually eats well, in my family home there is usually at least soda around which I cannot control. I usually have less trouble with stuff in the house as opposed to grabbing things on commutes or when out to lunch.     

One other slight issue I've found is that I rarely have more energy when eating healthy than when eating bad, and tend to use that as an excuse. Feel more tired/angry/depressed, even for months in.  

I feel I know generally how to eat well, and have tried several different mods to my diet all to the same effect: calorie counting, paleo, more body-building inspired cutting diets, etc. I can usually do these for a set goal of time or weight assuming it's relatively short and doesn't hit a midterm/finals session. I've heard a lot of reports of increased energy and such in both literature and on r/loseit and the like, but have not experienced it.  "
367," Hello,  

This is my first post other than my new person intro, so please be gentle ;)   
I'm currently in a heavy duty, year round schooling program and every time I hit midterm season, finals, or holidays I seem to crash off my diet and eat all sorts of junk. The main culprits seem to be Ice cream (with mixed in candies), soda, bread-y foods, and various holiday naughty baked goodsDuring these times I feel my thoughts going to these things all the time, planning out the next cheat. I also really enjoy eating out with my fiance and play dnd weekly which often leads to similar snacking if such things are at our game.  

Any advice on stopping such behaviors? Anyone in similar situations that figured anything out?

 "
368," Hello lose it!

I've been a lurker for a bit, but here's my introduction.
M/24/5'8""  Starting weight 248  Goal weight 180 Current weight 236

I put on nearly a hundred pounds through college (with very very little drinking surprisingly). Through the past two years since I finished undergrad I have fluctuated all the way down to 209, but always seem to fall back into old habits and am now back up to 236. I'm currently a chiropractic student, so while I feel like I know how to diet and exercise I have a lot of issues with actually sticking to it. I'm in a very hectic school schedule (~30 credit hours per trimester) that goes year round with only short breaks and seem to have some stress eating issues, especially during midterms and finals. 

Through these nearly two years I have also been weight lifting 2-3x a week and have seen a huge difference in my strength and muscular size, so there is definitely an increase in my lean mass as well. In the last 2 weeks I have been trying to slowly add in some HIIT and rehab type core work on 3 of my off days. I'm determined to defeat my hatred of cardio.

I'm currently 12lbs down from my high and am working to improve. "
369, Very complete and well done. Helped to inspire me to start getting serious again. Thanks a lot!

371, I second Citadels. 
372," **Pathfinder** Friend ran a short campaign while other players were unavailable, after that finished we moved on to some boardgames  

**Last Night on Earth** We played one round of it, my first time playing as a hero. I heroically sacrificed myself several times.  

And a few rounds of **Citadels** (the card game which is a quick, fun, little strategic mess), which was the first time for the rest of my group. They seemed to enjoy it a lot and want me to bring it along next time "
373," If you're willing to wait till Sept to get it, the Zombicide season 2 kickstarter is out and comes with lots of goodies. http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coolminiornot/zombicide-season-2 "
374, Backed as well. Found this independently and was planning on posting it myself.
