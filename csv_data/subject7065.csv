0," this is a small poll aimed towards anyone still in school! its only one multiple choice question im curious to know what most people would prefer in this scenario. 

[take the poll here](https://forms.gle/MgdK5WvgHTpWimW76) "
1, depends on the character! i can send you my price sheet if youd like 
2, commissions for these are open if anyone is interested btw! feel free to msg me if youd like one ;0 
3,  
4, this is adorable! 
5, thanks! 
6," i LOVE the idea of wynn spitting back at the aspids, thank you for sharing "
7, thank you!! 
8,  
9," im not totally sure yet because i cant decide whether being infected or not would fit her better, but im leaning more towards no right now! "
10, me too 
11, wynns title is aspid tamer so she does it by choice! theyre her friends :D 
12," the character on the bottom left, ysla, belongs to a friend outside of reddit "
13,  
14, these are some really cool ideas!! thanks for sharing :0 
15, id love to hear it! 
16," nope, she just has some dark colors on her ^^ "
17, id call her a pretty neutral character! she kind of does her own thing 
18, :0 im flattered!! 
19, yeah! 
20, im glad you think so! i spent forever messing with her color palette haha 
21, thank you! 
22, im glad you enjoy her!! 
23, kingdoms edge! but i like to imagine she ~~takes the aspids out on walks~~ travels a lot 
24, i imagine her as more of an npc than an enemy but thatd be a cool idea! 
25, wynn does it by choice! she just likes having them around 
26," shes a bee, yes! i dont have many ideas for her but she left the hive !after the queen died! and decided she enjoyed the company of primal aspids over everyone else. maybe the infection drove her mad, or maybe their acid just doesnt bother her somehow 

either way she feeds them scraps and has a swarm following her wherever she goes. she even managed to get her mask modelled after them, either by making it herself or having the swarm threaten someone into doing it for her "
27," yeah, i was working with a really small canvas so it got compressed to hell lol "
28, thank you so much! 
29,  
30," hey, im glad you like my reaction image! but id appreciate if you used the art with credit ^^ "
31, equipment-wise i think im doing the best i can for where i am in the game! maybe theres some items im missing but id rather not look up a guide 
32, broken vessel! im kind of awful at this 
33,  
34," fish food. i would squeeze between the fish tank and the wall behind it, which did nothing to hide me, and dump handfuls of flaked fish food into my mouth "
