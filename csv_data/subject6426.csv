0, SP7 has a huge impact on my life too. I watched all of it through and was so sad to see it come to an end but it was a great thing. Thanks for sharing with us! 
1," Thank you, good sir or madam! "
2," Thank you bob, very cool ! "
3, Thank you! 
4, Thank you! 
5, I really dig this idea! You wear it so well. The line work is great! 
6," I started doing yoga! Ive always like yoga but never committed to actually taking classes. Its doing me wonders, physically and emotionally. "
7, More accurately would be running to do all the chores you were supposed to do before she got home 
8," Nafenzer, 
We are all here for you. You matter. I dont know your situation at all, and I cant imagine what youre going through, but you are important. You are here for a reason, and I want you to be here. I hope you can find some peace and I hope you pull through this tough time. I hope you are okay. "
9," A good idea might might be to have a conversation with her about what both of your intentions are. It might have been unclear to her that since you guys arent dating officially, that what she did was crossing a boundary. If you really like this girl, tell her how you feel and be direct if you want to make things official. Lines can be misconstrued if you dont let your boundaries or wants/needs be known. 

I wish you the best of luck! "
10, James makes a killer Agent Cooper. 
11,  
12, I second this. Eriksons 8 stages might help you with writing this 
13,  
14, Wanting to be as safe as possible does not make this your fault in any way. Seems like she has some issues regarding STDs that she needs to or hasnt worked out yet.  
15, Is there anything you can specifically think of that made her turned off by sex with you? I have a feeling that shes just saying that to avoid getting intimate with you.  
16," Thank you Jakob, very cool! "
17, I read the title as applesauce ensues. I was confused for a minute.  
18, Yeah it doesnt pay well at all here in New Jersey either. But its very rewarding :) 
19," Im currently a psych undergrad student working in a group home for adults with developmental and intellectual disabilities. You dont need any sort of degree to work in a group home. I basically handle the day-to-day routine stuff with them like showers, meds, meals, etc. If this is what youre looking for, feel free to PM me! :) "
20," This is amazing. Great job, OP! "
21," Such an underrated song, I love it! "
22," Well, thats your opinion.  "
23," I felt like I was the only one who felt this way! I love Shane and Andrew and his little group. They all have great personalities and will always look forward to anything they post. I havent seen a single person being appreciative about Shane since his new video was uploaded, besides you.  "
24, Yes me too! 
25, I was honestly about to say that he hadnt uploaded in a hot minute but then we got BLESSED 
26, We all know James dyed his hair blonde so he could become the next Slim.  
27, Alec and I are the same age and I literally look like a 9 year old.  
28, Who is this cute little lesbian and why does she remind me of JonTron? 
29, Thank you for your input!!! 
30, Thats so great to hear. Thank you! 
31, This is very helpful! Thank you! 
32," Just a dumb question, but a serious question. Will having visible tattoos effect someones chances of getting to a grad school program? I have a few that are very easy to hide depending on outfits, but have always planned on getting more. For context, I live in the United States and was hoping to go into clinical psychology. Im about to earn my associates from a two year school and Ill be moving on to a four year university for the next step.  "
33," As much as I respect her decision and know that she needs to do whats best for her, I feel like there will be a big piece missing. Autumn is one of my role models and Im so glad to have seen her work and grow like she has. We love you Autumn, never forget that! "
34," Theyre super vibrant, I love them too "
35," I love all of the songs on b b but my absolute favorites are Stay, Paranoid, Rich and Sad, and 92 Explorer. They all make me feel some type of way.  "
36, I wish I was nearly as awesome and beautiful as Hila is! But thank you!!! 
37," Ive been told I resemble her except for the eye color! Thank you, thats a great compliment :) "
38,  
39," Honestly, Behind Closed Doors by B. A. Paris had me gripped from start to finish. It dumbfounded me how Jack was always one step ahead of the game. It made me even more paranoid of people than I already am.  "
40, Maybe suggest taking a break? Not totally breaking up but having time apart might help you to see what it is you truly need right now in your life.  
41, Ouch!! I hope James takes it easy until its healed up.  
42, RemindMe! 3 days 
43," Oh shoot, I meant offensive, sorry about that.  "
44," So, anyone is free to correct me if Im wrong because I could be wrong, Ive been picking up bits n pieces of the story. I think the reason he doesnt want to be on camera anymore is because people were saying really offensive stuff and he was tired of it. He still works there, he just doesnt want to be on camera in bits anymore. 

Edit: offensive, not defensive.  "
45," Jakob is one of the funniest guys ever, I miss him being in bits but I understand why he isnt anymore.  "
46," The bottom one is actually Poppy Harlow, get it right.  "
47, Interested 
48, Im getting the black long sleeve cow skull one in the mail on a few days! 
49," Im a psych major right now about to start studying at a 4 year college. My dad keeps urging me to choose a different path as well. I assume its because there is a lot of school that it takes to  get to a career. Theres not much you can do with less than a masters degree. But I think if you really like psychology, go through with it. Thats what Im doing! "
50," I guess for example I always invite friends out because I want them to feel included, but then Ill go on snapchat and see all of them hanging out without me. Dumb stuff I guess. I just want to feel as included as I try to make everyone else feel.  "
51, I think this is what I needed to hear. Thank you.  
52, Why wouldnt someone disappoint me? I guess I just have high skewed expectations 
53," I feel quite the opposite, as though I need to prove my worth to people in order to feel valid.  "
54," Thanks for your comment, that puts things into a better perspective to me. I dont know why I cant be real with him. Ill be sure to voice my concerns since it wont help either of us if I dont.  "
55, Good to know Im not alone in that sense 
56, This is what I was searching for.  
57, Why isnt this on the PewDiePie subreddit? All of his fans are 9 year olds.  
58, I love this  
59," I know what you mean, and Im really sorry it ended up that way for you. I used to be like that, I had the whole no one would care if I stopped making the efforts first. It weeded out A LOT of people but I have the only people who matter in my life right now. I guess my insignificance feelings are more towards the world/universe as a whole, for example what is the purpose of all of our efforts? I hope things get better for you though.  "
60, I didnt mean for that to sound sarcastic at the end  
61," Im only going to a community college for right now but Im soon transferring to a university, Im scared that thats gonna intensify what Im feeling. Thanks for sharing with me.  "
62, Thank you :) 
63, This sounds absolutely traumatic. Im so sorry you had to go through something like this.  
64, Couldnt have said it better myself.  
65," Tell him that if he doesnt clean up his act and start treating you like an actual friend and not just a person to borrow stuff from, then you cant be friends with him. This one-sided relationship is toxic and unfair to you. You can find better friends, although it may be tough since you said so yourself.  "
66, Those PLUMP LIPS 
67," Ive always just wanted a redo, like if I could just be born again and do things differently. Same circumstances, different choices.  "
68, So glad I won sprem race 
69, Scotts Tots.  
70," I hope they do too. If anything, remember even if you have no clue who I am, Im rooting for you to get better.  "
71," I dont think youre being ridiculous, the thugs youre feeling are just. I just think that things can get better if you tell the truth. Youll get the help youre looking for.  "
72," She wont judge you, this is what shes there for. Shes there to help you get better. And if she does judge you, shes not a fit therapist and you should find a new one.  "
73, Tell your therapist. They are trained to make the call whether or not you are a threat to yourself and withholding that information is counter productive to the reason why you are there.  
74," My friend recently got a tattoo with that bandaging on it, I have quite a few tattoos but have never been given that. Id say just trust you artist, they know best.   "
75, I really hope this is a joke.  
76, Made me miss the days when Jon still uploaded videos.  
77, I dont really know what I was expecting to see after scrolling through that 
78, Go for it! He seems interested.  
79, Cursed_Toilet 
80," I feel the exact same way, but I also feel like if I delete these apps Ill be out of the loop with my actual friends. My boyfriend also tags me in a lot of stuff and gets on my case if I dont respond to them. I feel pretty stuck when it comes to social media.  "
81," Eating disorders and depression are horrible mental illnesses. It is extremely hard for the person with these disorders to just snap out of it and often need psychological intervention. I think the best you can do is support her and try to help as much as you can for now. If and when she gets better, she might realize that she had such a great support system with her this whole time. But these things really do take time. Good luck with everything.  "
82, I definitely think you should keep your eye on her. Maybe help her find hobbies she enjoys to take her mind off some things? But therapy is definitely needed. I hope all goes well for you and her.  
83, Good for you guys! 
84," I definitely think you should ask her out on a date, but I also think you should seek some help for the issues youve listed. Maybe talking to a professional could help you get a clearer mind, and Im sure shed love to go on a date with you from the way youve explained your encounters with her.  "
85," I definitely see what youre saying and agree. I think there is fault on both ends, and his actions really do say a lot.  "
86," I dont really see the need to block him? Just stop answering. If he really wants to continue your friendship and not be weird about it, he will try. Doesnt sound like a good idea to let your romantic feelings for him to continue though.  "
87, Every time you have sex there is a small percentage that the woman will get pregnant. Man up to your shit.  
88," People are allowed to go out and not be on their phones the whole time. Personally, I hate being tethered to my phone when Im out with friends I havent seen in a long time. It sounds like he got annoyed that you were blowing up his phone and said somethings out of drunken spite. Im sure things will be fine but you gotta give your dude some space when its due.  "
89, The Office maybe? Sounds like a Michael Scott thing.  
90, Id love to see her face when no one shows up to her wedding.  
91, Just you.  
92," My sister did that with her SO around the same time, 6-8 months of being together, and theyre doing great. But every situation is different, whats great for someone might be hell for someone else, so its hard to really bank on other peoples experiences with this one. Wish you the best of luck though! "
93, Probably both honestly 
94," Drop him. Dont take shit from a man, theres someone out there who wont make fun of you.  "
95, Plenty of women wear all the fancy lingerie just for themselves. Theres confidence in feeling sexy. Also many women where things because they dont show underwear lines when wearing certain pants.  
96," Once you leave high school, all the people that claim to be your friends will never speak to you again. The ones that make the effort after high school will probably be lifelong.  "
97," This is rough, Id probably be screaming out of anger  "
98," Get out of there. Dont stay in a relationship where he thinks its okay for him to look at other women sexually. If you want to swap pictures with other people that arent the person youre in a relationship, then you clearly dont want to be in that relationship in the first place.  "
99," I think you made him feel like this was something he HAD to do, even if he wasnt ready yet. He probably loves you a lot, but even though youre ready for that next step in the relationship, he might not be ready yet and it sounds like you just guilted him into being engaged. Try apologizing.  "
100, My best friend went through this same exact thing. Her ex kept telling her that he thought he fell in love with other girls but was never sure. She put up with this for a year until she got fed up of feeling second best to every other girl. I believe you can find someone that will treat you like their #1. You can find something better.
