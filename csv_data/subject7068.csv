10," Are you using Spyder in the Anaconda suite? If not, I would suggest you do. Very easy to check your work. Could be how you valued/coded the threshold. Or first try adding , inplace=True after axis=1 in the line beginning with return: 

     return df.drop([col] , axis=1 , inplace=True)

 I'm not sure though. Good luck. "
11, My bad this is my first post using code. 
12," \#I made a fictional df to show a solution to what I think you are asking.

    import pandas as pd 
    import numpy as np
    
    df = pd.DataFrame ({'Age' : [21, 22 ,23 ,33 , 22,33],
          'TestScore': [70, 88, 55, 55,55,55],
          'TimeInHours':[1,1,1,1,1,1]})
    
    df
    Out[]: 
       Age  TestScore  TimeInHours
    0   21         70            1
    1   22         88            1
    2   23         55            1
    3   33         55            1
    4   22         55            1
    5   33         55            1

\#then I looked at the unique values for each variable with df.nunique()

    df.nunique()
    Out[]: 
    Age            4
    TestScore      3
    TimeInHours    1
    dtype: int64

\#So there are 4 unique values to show age, 3 for test score, and 1 for Time in hours

\#Now to eliminate variables that have more than 3 unique values I input the following

    for col in df.columns :
        if len(df[col].unique()) 3:
           df.drop(col,inplace=True,axis=1)

\#Output shows

    df
    Out[]: 
       TestScore  TimeInHours
    0         70            1
    1         88            1
    2         55            1
    3         55            1
    4         55            1
    5         55            1

\#As you can see the for loop dropped all the columns with more than 3 unique values--in this instance age.

\#so if you want to drop columns in your dataframe that have greater than 200 unique values you can use this as a reference to do so. I tried to make this as clear as I could but if you have any questions feel free. "

Thats how he has it written on his site.

Heres what happened when I went to test drive it:

I went to test drive it today about 45 mins before his close of business.

When I went to test drive the vehicle:

Visually:

Interior Immaculate. The inside condition was flawless. The exterior was flawless.

The engine: looked flawless. I even checked the belt for tightnesswas fine.

The Drive:

Smooth. No bad noises or anything. It glided across the roads just fine.

The brakes seemed to require more pressing than Im used to in terms of distancewhereas it took more pressure from my foot to feel the brakes breaking. I dont know if thats because they are like that on Chryslers or if there was something wrong.

I also put the gas almost to the floor and couldnt really tell if there was any struggle. I didnt do it for long, only about a second or two, and it seemed fine.

At one point I put the steering wheel all the way to the brink and didnt hear any abnormal noises. My current car whines a little when I do that.

I verbally offered him $5,300 for the vehicle. He skeptically asked me if I was going to need a loan. It seemed he was not going to agree if I needed a loan. Once I told him Id be paying by certified bank check he agreed.

I wanted to review the documentation first, so I used that as an excuse to get out of there before signing any legally binding documentation. I only had about 5 mins before he was going to close. I test drove 2 other cars and didnt want to stay any longer than I had to for the day. Regardless, I never sign anything unless I read and understand it as best as I canwhile not an attorney I have above average knowledge in legal processes and documents.

Im slated to purchase the vehicle tomorrow.

Based on its condition the car seems like it was owned by an elderly individual that drove it around for general errands and doctors appointments. He said he bought it from a dealer in New Jersey who got it on a trade in but didnt want to bother trying to sell it. Based on the low mileage and condition I almost think that hes telling the truth. My guess is someone passed away and whoever inherited the car traded it in.

The last used car I bought was a 2003 Alero with 70,000 miles for $7,700. I drove it for 8 years with no major disqualifiers. In my area rust will kill your cars chances of passing inspection.

Im not locked into any agreement. I have signed nothing. A handshake is legally worthless so I can bow out at any time tomorrow morning if I need to.

Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. "

Yes sir, that is my main premiss. "
81, The amount of amps (current) would be different because the resistances (ohms) are different. Thus the result would be different... Here is a calculator:  [http://energyusecalculator.com/watts\_volts\_amps\_ohms.htm?](http://energyusecalculator.com/watts_volts_amps_ohms.htm?) 
82," I'm gunna find out in a few days. Just wanted to discuss. Regardless, discussion leads to innovation. We will see... "
83," I'm going to experiment with this regardless but I think the 'controversial math' doesn't account for resistance (Ohms). Less resistance creates more current, thus allowing more heat, leading to more vapor. So a hit from a Novo: the square-root of 16 watts / 1.2 ohms = 3.65 Amps (Current)

 #x200B;

If you did the same for a Morph: Square-root of 16 watts / .25 ohms = 8 amps (Current)

The hit from the Morph would be almost 200% more powerful than the Novo in terms of current while using the same wattage...

So more heat ... and more vapor... "
84," If the Coils are made of similar material couldnt we still estimate how much current it would take to equate a similar experience by looking at the difference between the 2 coils Mass? 

So to calculate it right could you estimate: If the Morph coil is 2x the size of the Novo coil it would require twice the current? Could you just double the Watts from 3.33 to \~6 Wattsthis would double the current. Thats assuming electricity would travel through the material slower because of the Mass difference

Thanks for the response btw "
85, Current and wattage work in tandem with each other: More wattage means more current and vice versa. The element that makes a difference is the resistance (Ohms).
