0," This is the most uneducated question ever but...

Growing up my (conservative af) parents always spoke against Muslims, some of the things they would mention were ""the quaran teaches muslims to kill nonbelievers"" and other similar things is that true? Is it one of those things how the bible technically says dont eat kinds of sea food and where certain clothes and stuff but isnt practiced any longer? Are my parents just dumb (I mean they are anyways but...)?

I've always wanted to ask this but didnt want to offend someone. "
1, Why dont you keep your baby in your bedroom and share that room at first as it will be easier to have the baby close anyways. Then once the adoption is processed they could share rooms. Its such a simple solution that I feel like you have an entirely different reason for thinking this way. 
2, So would you rather the government continued to tax women more than men and continue that inequality or...? 
3, If you have too many geeky knick knack things around the house maybe get some stuff for his car? I got my husband spiderman car coasters for his birthday just a bit ago

Dont have more than one group photo and make sure the photo isnt you looking like youre in a relationship with anyone else in the picture. If you have any pictures with filters, make sure the first picture does not have a filter. Try and include a picture with you all dolled up. Try and include a picture of you doing something you enjoy or with a pet or something like that. 
While jokes are kinda of a risk, make sure you have something in your profile that would be easy to respond to in a message, it can be a joke, favorite movie book, etc. Something that someone messaging you could play off of- if its easier for them to think of a response then they're more likely to message you.

15," While you shouldn't let this chick get to you for sure and stick to being yourself, one thing I've found helps me shape social interactions is quite simple. Ask questions! I bet she loves talking about herself and her life. Plus it will make her feel like you care about this and her well being. It just shows in general that you're considerate to others and interested. Every Monday ask how her weekend was! And then if you can think of something you did over the weekend you can share that too. Then ask plenty of follow up questions too, slowly this will build up to conversations. "
16," Wasnt sure a good title for this.

Basically, I'm moving apartments in a couple months here. It will be me (22) my husband (24) and our newborn daughter. Along with that we are having my younger sister (19) move in as well. She is still in high school and doesnt work or have any credit history. She has a disability that prevents her from being able to work and she hasn't graduated high school anyways. (In exchange for living with us she will be taking care of our daughter while we are at work. It will be a safer living arrangement for her as well so all works out.)

The issue is that since she is over 18 apartment buildings want her on the applications as well. I understand why but I'm worried having her on the applications will affect our ability to be accepted. Our credit scores are average and credit history is on the lower side but all of our payments are on time and we dont have anything bad to be reported. Our previous landlords will be able to vouche for us as well if needed about our on time payments and such. So we're already a little iffy on 100 percent being accepted or not regardless of my sister.

How should we handle this? Should I be worried we wont be accepted? "
17, I'm not saying this is what's happening here by any means. I'm just saying it could potentially be the problem here and he seems to be ignoring the advice given by the counselor and I wonder if that's such a good idea for his relationship. 
18," I didnt say get in the mood. I said help her mood e.g. help her be relaxed happy and comfortable with him and life in general. Not horny... for instance if he was trying to help her relax by doing the dishes or something, but every night he did that he asked for sex every time and so in her head she thinks ""wow he thinks doing the dishes = he gets sex, nope"". And so eventually he gave up on asking for sex but that means he also stopped doing the dishes, that reinforces in her head ""wow he thinks if he does the dishes he gets sex"". That's not the way relationships nor sex work in a healthy relationship. Right? "
19," He didn't say hes still trying to help her mood though just that he stopped asking. Besides it's not gonna take just a short while of not asking for the issues to be fixed, this is gonna take time. "
20," I think he didnt get much out of the therapy as he himself said it came down to him needing to be nicer and him not agreeing that that was a problem and therefore it wasnt entirely successful. How would it come up in therapy that he needs to be nicer and such but at the same time not be the truth. This sounds like a concern that would have come up in therapy from the wives perspective and he is ignoring it. 

I dont think it's wrong to want sex from your partner but if you are being nice to your partner NOT to be nice fo your partner but to get lucky later that night then that is the exact definition of an ulterior motive. "
21," This kind of thing might be happening here. He says that he does nice things and such but my question is, is he nice for like a day and then that night tries to come on to her? Or does he sustain these behaviors for longer periods of time, long enough that when hes being nice and such shes had enough time that in the back of her head she isnt dreading going to bed that night and having to reject him again. That kind of anxiety in her head would counteract the nice actions and not relax her at all. I think he could try putting sex out of his mind for a couple weeks entirely and just focus on the emotional aspects of their relationship during that time to make sure those are going strong without making her believe there are ulterior motives and then revisit sex then. "
22," Get some practice by making some female friends online! Itll help you realize they arent all that different, especially if it's all through chats. I know its falling apart a little now but if you're willing to put up with the sucky parts of it you can go on omegle. Another way I made internet friends was through kik chat groups. I know both of these have bad reps, you gotta be willing to dig through the weeds for them but either way chatting with women online in a non romantic way will help you become more comfortable. "

Basically, I had a baby a month ago and this has made me relapse a bit and I'm in a rough patch. Its horrible timing because post birth none of my clothes fit and I have no idea what size I am.

I have no pants that fit anymore but shopping is torturous I literally cant do it. I hate going in, feeling squished, having to try stuff on until I find the right size and going back and forth from the fitting rooms till I get it and its different for every dang brand! I hate taking up space, feeling like I'm bugging the workers and am in everyones ways. It's even harder now that I have to bring the baby with me. Today my husband and I drove all the way out to the mall and when we got there I saw through the store windows and couldnt do it. My husband let me give up and I never even stopped the car we just turned right around and went back home.

I go back to work in a week and need clothes before then, please help!!!!

29," I remember my dad reading this to me when I was pretty young so he would have been reading it to me in the early 2000's but I believe the book was older than that.

In the book there was a family and I believe they were farmers. They had quite a few kids and I think there was some guy who didnt like them. He would do things like mess with their crops by throwing bad seeds in I believe. The kids worked together with their parents to do farm work and such.

The most memorable thing is that the farmer would often say to the kids something like ""johnny bella Ann Gregory and bob"" (totally made up the names, I have no idea what they actually were). Reading it allowed it had a definite flow to it "

58," I remember reading a childrens book when I was little and would have been reading it around the early 2000's so it could be from then or earlier. I believe the illustrations were black and white and I'm a drawing like style. 
The story was about a little kid who is kidnapped or like runs away or something and ends up like captured by a witch or something out in the woods. I think the witch plans to eat the kid but the house and the things inside the house help the kid to escape. I'm pretty sure at one point the kid uses a bone to convince the witch that she (?) Is super skinny and I think a dog gave the kid that advice. 
One thing I remember distinctly is the fact that there was an old fashioned bathtub that was the claw foot style. The child is made to clean themselves in it I believe and I feel like it talks to the kid or runs away with the kid in it or something and that's how the kid finally escapes entirely at the end of the storybook.

I'm sorry you personally had a bad experience with the system, that's a shame. But your experience is one of many and just because you had one bad experience doesnt mean these children should remain in a neglectful home. And besides the fact that you're not taking their ages into account here shows you dont know much about this as you would hope your own personal experience would have taught you. "

64," Hey everyone,

Like the title says pregnancy is hard. I hit 40 weeks yesterday and had an appointment scheduled. I went in and they told me my blood pressure was high and sent me to the hospital where they took tons of blood and did all this other stuff. In the end my blood pressure was getting higher every time they checked it but it never got up to severe and all the blood and urine tests came back fine so they sent me home. Now I'm stressed about having to pay 2 hospital bills instead of one and the fact that it was getting higher not lower but the worst part is no one seems to care. All anyone asks me about is the baby, no one cares over whether I'm okay and healthy just the little one. 

I know the baby is super important and stuff and I know I ended up sent home and being okay but I wish I still had contact with my mom because as terrible as she is, at least she would fuss over and be worried about me too. At least that's what I keep telling myself. I just want someone to be concerned about me and my health too and to stop just asking me about the baby but ask about me. I want someone to be the kind of worried where I'm telling them ""no I'm really okay"" and they are taking it almost too far but it's just the fact that they love me that much and really want me to be okay. The kind of overbearing love/concern that at the end of the day is nice to get sometimes. "

 NAH BECAUSE I am a foster care case manager and in our county at least it breaks a TON of rules to take pictures of our kiddos and post them anywhere. It's against a ton of privacy things and such and if you guys were interested in posting the picture anywhere it would no longer be possible. It's a rule a lot of people tend to overlook but it exits for good reason. Along with that if the kiddo ends up reuniting with bio fam that's actually a lot more difficult on foster parents than these parents may not realize if they havent yet gone through it. Displaying pictures with the kiddo in it could trigger them emotionally and make things difficult and these are pictures that most people would want to display. 

Option: get some pics with kiddo and some without that way kiddo is included but simultaneously if the kid ends up reuniting there isnt a mysterious kid in the pictures in ten years and you can post some, and if kiddo isnt reunited then you have pictures with the kiddo as well. "

I was watching this movie in the early 2000's but it could be earlier than that. It's a kid/family movie. In the movie I dont remember a lot but there is a monster civilization that lives beneath human society. The monster society travels up to the human world to make messes and steal singular socks to mess up pairs. In the human society there is a teen girl who is a main character. In the monster society they have something called ""smellovision"". There is a young boy monster who doesnt like being messy and stealing from the humans so hes kind of looked down on and has to hide it. One day I think his dad takes him to the human society and from there it gets hazy but I'm pretty sure the teen girl and him meet and she ends up coming to the monster society and they have to hide her? I dont believe the girl was animated but was live action and I dont remember much about how they did the monsters. This has been bothering me for YEARS! "

87, The exhaustion 
88," Hey bumpers,

I'm 36 weeks and am SO tired. Earlier in the pregnancy they determined I was pretty anemic and put me on iron pills and I remember before going on the pills I was so tired all the time but after going on them I felt better. Now I'm starting to feel how I did before again. It's not just normal tired, its tired to the point of struggling a TON to get up in the morning for work and then struggling to get my work done and then struggling to stay at work till the end of the day. I feel like I'm in a fog almost constantly. Take today for example, I fell asleep at 2 in the morning (a little late for me but whatever) and slept until 12 noon today waking up once every 3-4 hours to pee but falling back asleep after quite easily and sleeping deeply. Today when I woke up I was still exhausted for like an hour, I ate around 1 and was fine until like 2 when I felt dead exhausted again and fell asleep until just a little bit ago (4:30ish) and I'm STILL a little tired. 
This is how I felt before the iron pills and now im wondering if this is normal third trimester woes or if this could mean my iron pills stopped working or aren't working enough? Does everyone feel this way third trimester?
 I'm going to have them check my levels when I go in on Wednesday but ugh this is terrible! "

91," Hi teachers,

I'm new to this sub so let me know if I'm breaking any rules or asking something that's asked a lot and I'll delete or something. 

Anyways, I'm asking this for my husband who graduated 2 years ago from a pretty well known college for teaching in my area with an English education degree and is licensed for 7-12th graders. 

My husband is a part of a ton of websites with teaching job postings and applys to everything applicable- in my opinion he gets a lot of interviews during the hiring periods (at least like one a month). He made his resume with a lot of help from good standing people for education at his school and has quite a few good references. Despite this fact for every interview whether it be part of a 3 step interview process or just the one, he never makes it past the first interview and I can tell it frustrates him a lot.

He dresses appropriately and goes above and beyond researching the schools before hand and their missions and values etc. He even matches his ties to their school colors. Financially being a sub isnt a good option for us right now but he does other things on the side education related (teaching weekend classes to kids, along with something else I dont full understand). He just cant seem to make it past first interviews.

I was wondering if you guys had any tips or any things he might be doing wrong. This is in the SouthWest Ohio area if that matters.

TLDR: husband cant get a job teaching never gets past the first interview HELP "

100, For me it never fully went away but got more manageable with the occasional relapse depending on life stuff. I got to that point by mostly exposure although I coupled that with some thought management of forcing myself to not think that I'm a burden or whatever and trying to think as often as possible that other people are genuinely nice people who are happy to help me. Mostly thought it was just the exposure exposure exposure. (And faking it till I made it- if I pretended like I belonged/was being normal/whatever then it could be true). Getting a job working with customers helped with that as well due to the fact that since I felt my uniform gave me some authority I could feel less like a burden and self conscious and more like a boss. 
101," ESH but only because you didnt handle it well.

I had someone close to me have a surgery for scoliosis that resulted in this person being in near constant pain and being extremely depressed due to it (and being switched to home school for the surgery). I dont know what your brothers recovery has been like but it took me a year to understand fully what was going on with the person close to me and be more understanding. Maybe try and do things with your brother that wont cause him too much pain but can cheer him up some. Or motivate him by asking to do work together saying you work better with a study buddy. "
102," After NC for about 5 months my narc mom texted DH (I have her blocked) inviting us to Easter and I guess this whole time I've kind of had hope she could change or something because I was really considering it. DH didnt agree but was willing to respect my decision.

Well after milling it over I really thought about it and realized nothing she had done or I had heard about her would suggest she had changed at all and the last time I had been around family she and Edad spread a ton of lies around and bad mouthed me so I decided enough was enough.

I basically called her out on everything and she responded how youd expect of course, tons of lies, manipulation, gaslighting, rug sweeping. Only 2 things surprised me. 1. She admitted at one point she was in the wrong for not respecting boundaries BUT obviously she didnt apologize and also pretended like she had stopped doing that which she hadn't but okay. 2. She didnt express even the slightest interest in having me back in her life or in meeting or being involved with my daughter who is due in July. She basically said it was my loss and didnt even try one bit. 

I guess I should have expected it but I've noticed most parents on here are kind of crazy about the whole grandparents thing and the way my parents had talked in the past I figured they would be too. I guess not. Hopefully that doesnt change after LO arrives though.

Edit: Needless to say were back to NC and I have finally given up hope that her or the rest of my family will ever change. As freeing as it is in some ways, family holidays will be very depressing and lonely for awhile. Just looking forward to spending them with LO and DH next year. "

113," I've been in a similar situation (watching my parents abuse or neglect my younger siblings) basically my whole life. At this point they're futures are extremely bleak but the youngest one is 14. Basically all of them have dropped out of school and all this stuff and at this point I think it's too late to call CPS, but I wish I had when they were younger. Some of your siblings are still younger. Calling CPS because your mother isnt getting your brother the care he needs with his emotional mental issues aka medical neglect wouldn't necessarily get them removed from the home but it would potentially get someone in there to help guide your mom towards better resources and make sure your siblings are being better taken care of.  "
114," So I'm currently NC with my narc parents due to a LOT of reasons, driven by the fact that since I'm pregnant it's not just about protecting myself anymore but my baby. I've been VLC to NC for about 3-4 months now.

During that time I had to fix my relationship with my sister that was heavily influenced by our abusive past and was very codependent. We've fixed our relationship since then and were both doing a lot better with boundaries and just communicating better, but I will feel a lot less worried about her once shes moved out of my parents house.

I'm 21, shes 18 and isnt currently in school and has one year to finish. The reason she didnt finish school is she was hospitalized due to an eating disorder. She got out went to a in patient center for a week or so was doing well for a few months  but then relapsed and ended up back in the hospital.

At that point they recommended a more specialized inpatient about 4 hours from us  that we've been waiting on insurance to approve and preapproval they were acting all for it. The issue is she has officially been approved and now they're constantly trying to convince her not to go, at first they were telling her she didnt have a ride there so I offered. Then they changed the date,  so I adjusted my schedule and it would be fine. Then NMom started pulling some BS about the chicken pox going around and I cant be around sister due to the pregnancy. But I wasnt having it, so now they're trying constantly to convince her not to go or to push it off (knowing this would make insurance reject it). Theyve switched to telling her if she goes they'll kick her out and wont drive her to therapist appointments etc. Telling her everyone else there will be thinner than her even. Calling her names etc.

This is a very hard decision for her and shes being very brave agreeing to go but dealing with all of this is making her consider not going.

I'm so mad about it and she needs to go that I'm considering breaking NC just to go off because I am going to scream. Shes planning to move in with us in October but until then her moving out isnt an option unless they officially kick her out. 

TLDR: narc parents trying to convince sister to stay sick and not go to treatment and I'm mad enough I'm thinking about pausing NC to go off. "
115," For hearing more, ask questions about how the baby stuff is going but also let her be more than just a ""pregnant person"" ask about her typical normal stuff outside of pregnancy as well. "
116, When I went NC I left a few messaging avenues open to my parents for the same reason and my nmom especially didnt respect the boundaries I put in place by constantly a few times every day blowing up my phone switching from sweet to mean to inviting me over etc. Nparents cant respect boundaries and I would just go ahead and block them personally. 
117," I had a very similar experience. I graduated from high school with honors and already having a college education set up and a ton of AP credit- I worked my butt off. My dad refused to go to my graduation saying it was dumb and pointless he didnt go to dinner with my grandparents after either. And I definitely didnt get a party or anything. Meanwhile when my GC younger brother graduated the next year it was a D's get degrees kind of graduation that he scraped together from online school bc he couldnt be bothered to go to an in person school because attending school every day was apparently a waste of his time. He had no future set up at all and yet my dad took him and a couple other guys out for a whole weekend long camping trip to celebrate. My dad doesnt understand why I see anything wrong with this because ""it's a guy thing I couldnt take my daughter on a trip"" and ""he was thinking of going to the military so hed be moving far away"" as if I wasnt dorming. (he didnt go btw).

Now I dont even want to go to my college graduation for my double degree because high school was such a bad experience and graduations just make me sad now especially seeing everyone else with their family and I know mine wouldn't even care let alone go. "
118," Background: at least my mother is narcissistic, not sure what my dad is but I do know hes an a-hole who abused me and my siblings pretty badly growing up. As the oldest I ended up more of a parent to my siblings than a sister Now that my siblings are older they're taking after my parents quite a bit. 

So within the past couple months I've decided to go no contact. It basically stemmed from my parents and siblings choosing an extended family member over me who was treating me horribly and was CONSTANTLY over my family home to the point where I couldn't even have a positive environment to share ultrasound pictures with my nmom. I explained to them that I could put up with a lot but not this and at this point I was tired of them watching her treat me horribly constantly and still being buddy buddy with her and that it was her or me because I was tired of being everyone's dog to kick. Long story short, they chose her with full knowledge of the fact that it would result in me going mo contact and them not meeting my future bb.

I'm getting through it this is the longest I've been able to go NC with them and I'm still doing really well other than struggling with the guilt of leaving my siblings in their clutches. What bothers me the most is these dreams I've been having since around the time I went NC. All of these dreams are either one of my family members screaming at and physically attacking me in front of a ton of other family as an audience. I always end up having to defend myself physically against my attacker with an audience just doing nothing about it. The other variation of dream is a family member attacking a DIFFERENT family member that I have protected in the past. Once again this happens in front of an audience of family who do nothing and I have to solely defend this person, often getting very physically harmed in the process. A lot of times it ends up in me having to kill the attacker?? Idk what that's about.

Either way, I only noticed how these dreams connect together today and I guess it makes sense a lot looking at the reasons for a lot of my issues with family members in the past along with the fact that everyone let my dad abuse us growing up and I was the only one doing anything about it. 

I can handle the NC but these dreams are exhausting and making things hard. Does anyone else have similar dreams? Especially after going NC?

TLDR: after going NC I keep having bad nightmares that seem to be based in my past trauma and relationships with family "
119," So I'm currently pregnant and the baby is due late this summer. I recently went from LC to NC with my parents. It started about two and a half months ago and eventually culminated in me having to block my parents and some other family (siblings and extended family) on everything to stop the harrassment. Since then things have been vaguely radio quiet (though I discovered Nmom has left some very interesting emails). From some aunts I still talk to I found out that my family is playing it off as pregnancy hormones. 

Basically, I know that once I actually have my baby things are going to explode 1. Because they won't have pregnancy hormones to try and blame it on anymore and 2. Theyll be obsessed with meeting my kid and how I'm keeping their grandchild away from then. In the past its something my parents have talked about as being such a bad thing to do to grandparents so I know they feel strongly about it.  Even within the first month while I was still in contact my mom wasnt respecting baby things, posting about my pregnancy before I had and without my permission and constantly talking and posting about what her grandparent name would be despite the fact that I told her I didn't like it.

I'm terrified of what's going to happen and them showing up at my apartment or the hospital (although I will be talking to the hospital about visitors and stuff to be careful). 

TLDR: Growing up I always told my parents one day I'd be gone and me and my kids wouldn't be in their life. Now its finally going to happen and I'm scared of their reaction. "
120, Youre as bland as an unseasoned white ladies thanksgiving turkey  
121, Moms help. I dont have anyone to talk to about my pregnancy and it sucks. Im the first of all my friends to get pregnant and I dont have any female adult role models in my life. Turns out I hate being pregnant. Im only 13 weeks along and I already wish it was over. I have such bad insomnia at night then Im exhausted during the day and its making me suffer in college and my internship. I just feel like my body is failing me and I have no one to turn to. I dont even know whats normal or not.
