2, Is this a joke or not? 
3, Are those beans? 
4, I am around the same age as you and my dad just tells me to stop pouting and to cheer up also you too young for that just be happy! Its horrible and it makes me feel guilty about myself 
5, I try to tell him my problems but all he says is sTOp pOutInG. This is really helpful and its great to know that my own dad doesnt understand 
6, Thank you man really thanks 
7, I have school tomorrow and I just wanna stay in my room with the lights off just like my weekends alone with nobody but myself and my journal ( and my knife) and Im freaking out. I dont wanna go but I have to I go to a small school and my dad will get suspicious and he doesnt know about the pain Im going through right now and I just need help. 
8, Eating food in general makes me feel sick. Ill feel extremely hungry then only eat a small amount then usually throw it up or deal with a stomach ache the rest of the day 
9," Yes, but I keep my room this way because I stay in my room for days on end in the darkness so I dont see the mess anyway "
10, I have this same issue and Im 15 
11, Everyone on this subreddit is here for you man! 
12, Lol 
13, Seize the means of production? Almost like this has been tried before... 
14, Its an old one :D 
15, Were all on this subreddit for a reason and weve all been hurt and feel what your going through. We all understand. 
16, I cant even play video games they just arent fun anymore I mostly just stay on this subreddit and also just lay down silently or cry 
17, I got a 35-21-27 
18," This happens to me as well. I have a cat that I love to the moon and back but I always have this thought,  what will I do when hes gone?? and it makes me wish I never had gotten him "
19, Your not alone on this tiny subreddit in this big world. We all support people here. We have all felt pain and emptiness and know what its like. 
20," I dont know the answer to this but I just wanted to say you are not alone, Ive cried myself to bed for the past month or so but recently I just havent. I havent been feeling happy either just empty. "
21, Im feel Im too young 
22," The beauty of this tiny little subreddit is that we are all people, all staring at our screens and helping each other, here I sit and here you sit, and I find myself giving help to a random person I know nothing about. I know what your going through and you know what your going through. Together we can get through this. Ive had an amazing family and great friends but I just feel like its fake and they dont really care about me. This is why I love reddit is you can just talk and talk and get support. So, please for all of reddit, for your family, for you.. please just remember were all here and we want you to be happy. Good luck on your trip stranger! "

24, Wow just.. wow. This is the first step which is telling someone and youve done that subconsciously which is pretty amazing. I cant even do that yet and Im working on it. I feel your pain I went a week without coming out of my room and I used to be an extrovert and feel that I cant go back to how I used to be. Just remember that everyone on this tiny little subreddit is a person sitting at their computer anonymously supporting each other. Thats the most amazing thing about this place is that its all just people who feel each others pain. 
25, I do this a lot I try to plan out how Im gonna talk to people then I forget everything when I actually do and end up telling them what is in my opinion way to much info. 
26, Only thing I am is a special needs nobody 
27, Ill take that any day
