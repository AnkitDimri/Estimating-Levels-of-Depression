0," oh sorry, i misread your post. Hojo is almost guaranteed. i think Bay State is pretty easy to get as well if you don't have a terrible number, because i was originally placed there my sophomore year. i was able to summer swap into Myles, but i think that's pretty uncommon and you usually can't get in unless you're getting pulled in. i think South is pretty much a toss up. it could be possible. "
1," it's $2000 a year, not semester "
2," it's pretty unlikely you'll get into Myles, South, and a tiny more likely you'll get into Bay State. Hojo is definitely the easiest to get into as a freshman because not many freshman want to live there, but it's not popular enough with upperclassmen to fill up very fast.

i lived in Hojo my freshman year. cons are that it's pretty dead and can be kinda hard to make friends through your dorm compared to the large freshman dorms (Warren and West), some of the rooms have tiny ass windows, and they're mostly all triples. pros are that you get your own bathroom, you get arguably the best ac/heating system control possible for BU housing, and the top floor study hall is creepy and weird, but also has a nice view of Boston. "
3," do you happen to know what the usual cut off is? my EFC has been $0 for three years, but this year, i noticed it was about $1000. pretty worried im gonna have to pay extra money. "
4," eh, i'm not a fan of Katy Perry's work, but her MTV Unplugged sessions from ages ago are honestly incredible. maybe she's a shit singer now, but you'd be hardpressed to tell me she sounds bad in those recordings. "
5," i don't have any leads, but i live right off of Kenmore Sq. and i would love to participate in a clothing swap "
6," dude why does it even matter? whether or not this dog understood anything or was trying to convey anything, it saved this person's life. the fact that you even felt a need to comment something like this to someone who has obviously been through the ringer is just disgusting to me. let them have their tiny bit of happiness. "
7," you sign up for summer swap sometime after you do regular housing selection. it's through the housing portal and basically the number rank goes backwards (so if you had a really shitty number before, you'd have a really good one for summer swap).

honestly, i think stuvi 2 is almost impossible even if you're a rising senior. i've heard that most years, it fills completely up during same room and internal (same building) selection. it doesn't even make it to regular selection. take this with a grain of salt though because it's just what i've heard and i've never known anyone who actually lived there anyway.

edit: only juniors and seniors can live in stuvi 2 apparently "
8," i lived in Hojo my freshman year. it's nice to have your own bathroom, but the dorm is hella quiet. most people do not use the common areas and there's very little going on. i would say your chances of getting in as a sophomore are pretty high.

i've lived in Myles for two years and it's infinitely nicer in terms of the facilities and all. it's a bit rowdier than Hojo, but still relatively quiet compared to the bigger freshman dorms. there are often people hanging out in the common spaces though. getting in as a sophomore is pretty rare. i got in through summer swap my sophomore year, so i'd recommend that if you can't get it during regular housing selection. "
9, ES105 with Anderson is very easy and he's an entertaining professor. highly recommend! not a lot of work at all and he's honestly hilarious and a true icon. 
10," totally agree with this, especially the part about money going to reputation. BU is so focused on appearances and its blatantly obvious when you look at what they choose to spend money on.

tried desperately to transfer after my second year, but my state school's administration took too long to notify me about my fin aid so i got stuck here. "
11, this is beyond incredible. what a good idea. my partner is currently having such a hard time breaking out of thinking they/them is plural only (doesnt help that he teaches english classes) and i could see some variation of this helping out so much! 
12," wow im so glad you posted this. its something ive never thought of doing, but i could see this helping me substantially. being alone is a huge trigger of my health anxiety. "
13," complaining about dirty dishes at a university that costs 75k year. jeez, i know right, what ungrateful idiots

 #x200B;

lol "
14," yep. i know many people say Bay State is the best dining hall and maybe i only have this problem because it's the one closest to me, but literally every single time i go, i have to check every single thing i use. the cups are usually always murky with old stuff on the glass, the silverware is often still caked with old food. it's disgusting and having clean dishware is literally the least BU can do "
15, definitely second Myles. almost everyone i know that lives there is going abroad next semester. 
16," i was curious about this comment, but i see no mention of any publication called the Daily Caller. where did you see this? "
17, no dude. this is an unbelievably thoughtless response. have you ever seen Shapiro speak? he is very very good at making himself sound right regardless of his inability to cite his arguments. people who are into Shapiro who haven't looked into him enough are the fencesitters i'm talking about. those are the people most at risk for agreeing with him because of his assertion that he is right. what makes you think people who don't care enough to do research on him would care enough to fact check his arguments? they wouldn't. they would be swayed by his rhetoric. having Shapiro speak on campus is dangerous because of those individuals precisely. 
18, you can't dismantle arguments in that type of setting. debates are unproductive if one person has more speaking power. 
19," i have absolutely no issue with conservative speakers coming to BU, even though i am not conservative. however, ben shapiro does not debate nor argue with good faith arguments. he routinely misquotes studies and articles that are easily googled. i would never go out of my way to protest his speaking at BU, but he is not just any conservative speaker. it is harmful for fencesitters to be exposed to these bad faith arguments not at all rooted in his FACTS and LOGIC. 

also there is a sociologically objective definition of racism, but you know, go off "
20," damn suck BUs dick a little more, why dont you? "
21, \^\^ this. no one needs to be making this amount as a university president. 
22, yeah the jadons i ordered were in the smooth leather so hopefully it's not too bad! 
23, how long did yours take to break in roughly? just wanna know what i'm likely in for. 
24," I just ordered a pair of black Jadons after trying them on in store and falling in love, but I'm terrified of the breaking in process. It seems it would be much harder because they're heavier and the soles don't bend as much. Am I correct in thinking this? Also, due to these being platforms, are they considerably less comfortable than other Docs even after breaking in?

Would love some insights from Jadon/other platform Docs owners! "
25," im honestly not sure. ive only had her hem pants for me, but it would definitely be worth giving her a call! "
26, love this pin! where did you get it? 
27," i always joke that my wardrobe is just white and black patterns. a typical outfit for me is having either my top or bottoms in a black and white pattern (so like houndstooth sweater or striped pants) and then matching that with a solid black top or bottom. occasionally a throw in a pop of color, but usually something quite muted. i have a red plaid coat that goes so nicely with the rest of my usual outfits. "
28," okay so hear me out. there's this old lady named Brunhilde who runs a very modest tailoring business out of her apartment in Fenway and she is 1000% worth it. her prices are lower than nearly anywhere else i've seen in Boston and she's unbelievably sweet, helpful, and funny. just look up Brunhilde tailoring on google and you'll see the address. you have to give the number a call and set up an appointment for her to let you into the building. it seems a bit sketch, but she's really such a sweetheart and a hidden gem.

edit: she also only takes cash just so you know "
29, this is not even the first time youve made a comment like this lol this guy has to be trolling. you cant be for real. 
30," yeah, i have. my freshman year, i accidentally maxed it out around mid november as well and it was honestly hellish. "
31, ES105 with Anderson is a great choice for someone not good at science. hes a great professor but also very easy. 
32, maybe do some research on him at all before commenting 
33," Yang has never said he's actively against a higher minimum wage. He has said, and is right, about the fact that raising minimum wage will incentivize automation (as most min wage jobs are already being lost to automation) and that it won't end up helping those people in the long run anyway. In reality, very few people in the US are working minimum wage jobs. "
34," yeah this is true, but i am already out of dining points so i was planning on switching now :( "
35," yes. if you can make it to next semester, you will get a lot of points. i managed to get $1500 in dining points last winter semester because i was able to wait and switch. "
36," So as many of you know, it's a common hack to switch from the 330 to the 250 dining plan around late October (or the beginning of next semester for even more points), but apparently they've changed the deadline to switch. You can now only switch plans in the first 4 weeks of school which means that the 330/250 hack is effectively gone if you choose to switch in the middle of first semester.

You can still switch at the beginning of next semester for more points, but most people I know couldn't make it that long. Just thought I'd let everyone know that if you were planning on switching soon, it's not a thing anymore :( "
37, i started this and then gave up. i dont even know how to answer most of these questions. this is not a survey. 
38, \*cries in long distance relationship\* 
39, homelessness is an issue that hurts me to my core. a huge reason i am for Yang is because of how UBI could help the homeless population. 
40, wow this is intense lol 
41," i already have credit for that from high school, but thanks! "
42, I'm looking into planning my schedule for next semester and a large chunk of my requirements are completed. I'm trying to find some super fun and relatively easy classes to take as electives that give 4 credits. Any suggestions of specific classes or professors you'd highly recommend? 
43, it is a mixed bag. my advice is to never buy anything without reviews. the reviews are soooo telling. 
44," most people work food service or retail for their first jobs because other jobs usually require that youve worked before. i know nothing about lab positions, but i imagine many places would not accept someone who had never worked before. "
45," yeah, you can change it until late october. not sure what the exact deadline this year is, but im pretty sure itll tell you on Student Link. the last date is usually the 20-something of October. "
46, i agree wholeheartedly. we are just very recently coming into a time where it is seen as the norm to accept gay individuals and i absolutely believe the same will come for trans people. 
47," i wish this was me. i stopped shaving my underarms a year ago because i just genuinely like the way it looks, but holy fuck, it just stays wet for so long if i sweat. thankfully, it doesnt make me smell any stronger, but in the summer, theyre always wet. "
48," holy shit, where do you live????

i get mine done for $60, but where i used to live in a smaller, less expensive city, the nicer places cost $35. "
49, just wanted to say thanks for trying to do this. i'd kill to see Jay Rubin's full translation of Wind Up Bird. i even attempted to learn Japanese for a year specifically to try and read those omitted chapters 
50," More than just one line in Dance Dance Dance. He spends tons of time alone with Yuki and consistently brings up sex and her body throughout the novel. Great book, but it's definitely a challenge to read past that. "
51, Cool thanks so much!!! 
52," I see on their site that they do delivery, but do you know if I also can just walk in and give them the coat? Do I need to have them do pickup and delivery? It would honestly be easier for me to just do it myself. "
53," I'm trying to get a faux fur coat dry cleaned before it gets cold enough to wear it, but all of the dry cleaning places near campus either have no reviews or don't list their prices on their website. Does anyone have any suggestions? "
54," oh lol, had no idea. just assumed OP meant irl "
55," i've only ever played the [sh.io](https://sh.io) version, but i'd be super interested in playing it irl if i could find a group! "
56," i have never applied to study abroad, but i've heard that the London and Dublin programs are the easiest to get into. "
57," ES105 with Anderson has been a god send for me because i am not a science person. he's very chill and actually makes lectures interesting. he literally shows you actual exam questions at the start of every class so you can just plug them into quizlet and memorize that shit if you need to. also, labs are super easy and this could just be my TA in particular, but there's a ton of hand holding involved so you end up getting whatever answers you don't know anyway. "
58, it's so easy to get it as a freshman honestly. freshman entirely avoid it. everyone i know who wanted it freshman year got it. 
59," yep, i lived in Myles last year and our ceiling got so bad that you could literally feel paint chips hit your head while you were showering. i'm living in the same room this year and when i got back, i saw they fixed it, but it's already doing it again so they obviously haven't learned. "
60," is this the Aloft hotel chain? i've been in a couple in various cities and they all have a sort of ""pixelated"" theme. wish i had pictures, but their pillows and window shades are exactly like this! "
61," i get this too, but funny enough, i only really get it during the day. i remember trying to lay in the field during recess as a kid and look up at the clouds and it always frightened me so much. "
62, what direction is this facing in kenmore? it almost looks familiar but i literally cant tell what view this is. 
63," this is just a full fledged dysphoric rant, but i am AFAB and hella fucking short (like under 5 feet) with a relatively noticeable hourglass figure. this just makes it impossible to be anything other than femme-presenting because all pants are so restrictive. 

i recently found a pair of vintage striped pants that weren't skinny jeans (which are literally the only pants i can ever find that will fit to my body) and had the ""right"" measurements. it was a miracle and i spent a good deal of money to buy them on a site that doesn't offer returns. i got them today and they look terrible on me. they are so baggy to the point it's almost comical, when in reality, they were supposed to be wider legged with some tailoring. 

i've just been feeling so dysphoric lately because all i can seem to find that consistently fits are skirts, dresses, or tight pants (like legging type fits) and i'm not against looking more femme, but i'm just so hyperfeminine because of my limited clothing options and body type. it's so discouraging and upsetting.

do any other enbies have similar experiences with their body type just being so restrictive? "
64," Just a request to change the question ""what is your gender"" to ""what is your biological sex"" if you're not going to have an ""other"" option. Couldn't even answer past the second question because of that. "
65, you felt cute because you are cute!!!! 
66," wow as a relatively new identifying afab enby, this is exactly what ive always felt like. super affirming to read this. "
67," can anyone give me an idea of how likely it is that this will go anywhere? it seems like anytime this man does something impeachable, it blows over in a couple days. this feels different though. "
68," just chiming in as a sociology major.

i picked this major because i truthfully had no desire to go to college and it was the only subject i could even fathom myself having any large enough interest in to be able to sit through 4 years of classes. BU was very generous with my financial aid so i don't feel i'm wasting any money doing this major. i often think that i should have just gone straight into the work force instead of going to college, but i am learning a lot that feels very important to me even though i will probably never do anything related to sociology. i truly think this major is making me a more aware, thoughtful, and understanding human.

i just want to work a 9-5 boring ass desk job (preferably in administration or as an assistant) which i could probably snag without a degree, but i also recognize the high likelihood of me making even slightly more money with a degree vs. not having one. i have no desire for my career to be at all related to my passion, i just want an easy job that i can forget about when i go home that will fund my outside passion. "
69, couldn't answer this survey because i literally don't like any of these categories and there isn't an option to leave the final question blank 
70," sure, hes right that often children are used to push talking points, but who the hell else is talking about this in the way she is?? did you even hear/see the speech she gave today? she cites real numbers because shes coming from a country where climate change is not a debate, its a fact. 

also the hundreds of climate strikes that happened this week? those would not have happened if not for her. 

sure shes a child, but thats no reason to discredit the very real awareness she has brought. "
71, the replies from this video on twitter are very similar. it's terrifying that so many people can think this way. 
72, its definitely because she has goosebumps. she even rubs her arm to try and make them go down. 
73, can you link this? im an afab nonbinary person and im super curious! 
74, just go to the dock on the Esplanade on any decently nice day/night and there's always solo smokers there 
75," im a nonbinary individual who uses they/them and i also wholeheartedly agree that parents raising their children this way is wrong. no child has a concept of gender that young and they should be given freedom to explore it, but these parents are essentially forcing a nonbinary identity on their child who is likely going to be cisgender (based on statistic likelihood). 

i think its one thing if your child doesnt want to adhere to gender roles or appearances, but parents who allow their child to medically transition...i just can not justify that. im all for them allowing their child to appear as whatever gender they want or using the pronouns they want, but bringing medicalization into it that young is just wrong in every situation i can imagine. "
76," yep this has totally been me. im a femme person more interested in women usually than men and so i rarely have a type when it comes to guys. i just date people that are kind to me. 

ive had some acquaintances tell me that im dating far below my league or hint that they hate when pretty girls date ugly guys around me and its so fucking awful. "
77, lol well then maybe play when you're not between classes? 
78," bro, i agree with all of this but citing him reading Yukio Mishima as promoting fascist literature is wack. "
79," might have just been a bad time of day or something. sometimes i make normal games with meta and i still get no one to join after half an hour. kind of shitty that observers were being dicks. you probably would have a hard time filling up a no-meta game as fast as regular games fill up, but i would suggest just trying again or looking for a no-meta game. they aren't like super super common, but i've also seen quite a few while searching for games. "
80," again, you could just make a no meta lobby. i see people do that fairly often.

i do agree that a lot of high elo players are hella toxic against people who don't know meta, but you also don't have to play with them. "
81," there is a wiki on the website explaining the ins and outs of meta, but i find that most people have no idea they need to look at that before playing. i agree that it should be more front and center. "
82," tbh yes, i would totally be down for that. i'm truly trying to get better and i wanna know what i can do. i'm on a 15 game losing streak and i need to know how the hell to break out of that. "
83," yeah obviously. that's why i made the post? 

i ranked plat my first season and have been slowly dropping down so it's definitely not that i just haven't played enough. just trying to get some tips. "
84," and Yang, but you know, the media loves to conveniently leave him out "
85," for context, i switch between lucio and moira (though i'm definitely more of a lucio main). 

i totally recognize it could be me, but i guess i was confused because i normally get gold medals. of course there are games where i die a ton, but i would say usually, i don't die more than 2 or 3 times in a given round, even if we're doing poorly because i always retreat if a lot of my team dies. i rarely ever get gold elims unless i'm moira, but i do often get gold obj kills as lucio just because i'm staying on point most of the time and when i'm waiting for my abilities to recharge, i'm taking shots at low health enemies. 

thanks for the tips though! i will definitely start looking at replays and see what i can fix. "
86," wow big oof. sad to think people still believe this shit.

adult humans can consent, animals can't. what's so hard to understand? "
87," i either solo queue or play with my partner who often ranks a bit higher than me, but is still having a similar issue. "
88, you can't send anything through the mailroom. you have to go to either the usps on deerfield or the fedex under warren. 
89," i heavily agree with this. obviously hes done some pretty shitty things, but if you watch any of his content even semi regularly, its very obvious that hes not actively seeking to further any sort of agenda. im glad hes trying to distance himself from the huge population of his fans who are literal neo nazis. "
90, yeah he actually even stated in the video that he realizes that its a bit late to come to this conclusion 
91," yep, this just showed to me that so much of his fan base are idiots. glad to see one decent person in the comments here lol "
92," it works if you do it on the last day each semester to change it (sometime in late october), but you get way less than if you wait and change it once at the beginning of second semester "
93," i hate to be that person, but weed is definitely a bit pricier than that in boston. not by much, but its really not unusual and even probably expected for it to be a little higher than what youve listed. "
94," ive been at that point for a while, but therapy is criminally inaccessible in the US. i just got health insurance for the first time two years ago and it took until six months ago for me to even get an appointment with a therapist after fighting for one from the minute i got insured. she ended up being a joke so im in the process again of being waitlisted and just hoping something comes through. "
95," thank you for this. im currently in that part of my life where i get spells of just saying i cant take this, i cant take this along with severe heart anxiety and im trying so hard to get therapy. this gives me a little bit of hope. "
96," even though i got asked repeatedly if i was a freshman at splash while signing up for things, i am also a junior who put my email down for a few clubs yesterday! "
97," i mean, i guess it could be, but it seems likely real considering it was once a very active blog with way more on it than the aforementioned posts. she was very obviously a super mentally disturbed person and tbh it was really fucking sad. "
98," not the original commenter, but i play minecraft with my long distance SO a lot. it's nice to be able to work on a world alone and together and being able to show him the stuff i've made while he's been gone is really nice. we also have our separate houses with special gift chests in them where we leave each other surprises! "
99, lol what class requires you to make a comic using word and google??? 
100," im a 3rd year student in college and i went to a couple big frat parties my first year and absolutely hated them. i also dont drink because it always makes me feel sick so i just felt like there was no point. 

i still dont go to many parties, but the ones ive been to since that ive enjoyed have always been smaller gatherings of like 20 people or so. thats way easier said than done, but as you meet more people, youll find smaller parties to go to that you may enjoy much more! "
101," hi!! im a queer femme in my 3rd year who has still also not made any other queer lady friends and im also desperately looking. i think i may go to that reception on wednesday, but we should link up! im also a bit socially awkward so its been hella hard for me to put myself out there too. 

feel free to DM me and maybe we can go to that dinner together so we both dont end up going and talking to no one hahaha "
102," just to add to this, they only take convenience points, not dining points! "
103," damn well i guess they probably came into my room when i wasnt there this morning then. my roommate said the same thing about his request. oh well. 

thanks! "
104, so nice to see Natalie fans in the wild 
105, you can only owe less than $1000 before they start to care. im perpetually livin in that sweet $900 range to avoid the wrath. 
106, i want to make some friends this year. ive somehow gotten all the way to junior year with very few people i feel at all close to and im hoping that im able to get my ass out of bed to do some clubs and stuff this year. 
107, well youre wrong lol. virtually every animal species has examples of homosexuality and thats about as natural as you can get. sexuality is just natural in general. 
108, why? 
109, obviously none lol. all the trans people i know live super normal and average lives. 
110, blowfly girl is actually real (or probably real). the blog the main two entries are posted on contains tons of posts that are also about her depression and other everyday things. 
111," i love secret hitler and honestly, i love meta now that i know it, but holy fuck people are so toxic on there. it took me forever to even figure out meta because people just dont want to tell you or make fun of you if you dont know some of the terminology. its honestly super shitty. 

that being said, i have met nicer people on there who helped me learn meta and stuff, but in my experience, it seems like the vast majority of people on there are just so so angry about everything and care way too much about a game. "
112," yep! there are specific places you can use them at and you either hand it to the cashier like a credit card or theres sometimes a little thing that you can tap it against, but not everywhere. just hand it to them and if youre supposed to tap it, theyll just tell you to! "
113," tbh, no. you can also totally unloft beds in the doubles so im not too sure why OP is so tilted about that in particular. "
114," thanks for the responses! i definitely have a few more questions. 

how early on did you realize you had multiple personalities inside of you? has it been something youve had for as long as you can remember? im curious how you dealt with it and understood it while you were young (if you had it then). 

do you take any medication for it? is there even any medication for it? 

if you could just have one personality tomorrow, would you take it? or do you feel like youd lose pieces of yourself? "
115, i hate articles with bullshit titles like this. i feel like this does no good but make people complacent with not voting. 
116," apologies in advance if any of my questions are rude or invasive! im just genuinely curious but feel free to skip any!

what was the process of getting diagnosed like? how early was it obvious to you/family/friends that you may have something like this?

you mentioned in another comment that its like youre not in the drivers seat anymore when you switch, do you mean that youre still aware of whats happening as you? 

how does DID affect your ability to form relationships with people? do your other identities remember the relationships youve formed or is there a process of sort of introducing them to people individually?

can you control when you switch ever? "
117," thanks for commenting this!! had no clue this event was happening, and its something i would really like to participate in. "
118, this is just not true at all lol 
119," you can either switch right before the cut off date for switching (usually in late october) or switch right before second semester starts. you get more points if you wait until second semester, but it works better for some to switch earlier if you want a little bit more dining hall swipes. "
120," fwiw i personally have known way more people who never got another roommate after theirs left, but that may totally not be normal. "
121," for me, i usually assume there is no discussion unless your professor emails the class otherwise. "
122, no option to leave early tomorrow unfortunately :( saturday late at night is our earliest option so i guess we just need to be ready for extreme traffic 
123," hey all. im in orlando right now, driving back home to atlanta from a short trip either very early sunday morning (5-6am) or if need be, saturday night (2am or so). 

right now, as far as traffic is concerned, will we likely hit bad traffic leaving? seems like most people are evacuating to orlando and not leaving orlando. can i get any insight on when would be best to leave? "
124, Coming from Atlanta on the same timeline. My partner and I are planning on reassessing Saturday night and possibly driving through that night to avoid traffic in the morning. 
125, thanks so much for the tip! this is pretty much what we have in mind! we're in a pretty gas-efficient car too so i'm thinking we will be able to pull it off. 
126," I wish we could stick it out in Orlando, but I actually am catching a flight out of Atlanta to the north for college and classes start on Tuesday so I'm doing my best to make this super rushed and impromptu trip work out. "
127, we're planning on leaving Saturday night or super duper early Sunday morning so I think we're going to miss most of the traffic. we're prepared to be fully gassed up before we leave Orlando. 
128," Kind of A, kind of C.

I'm driving to Orlando Friday morning and planning on leaving Sunday morning originally. We are going to probably go and then reassess Saturday morning to figure out if we need to just leave then. Will suck only having one half day at Disney, but it's an important trip for me. "
129," Yeah, we think we're going to bite the bullet and try to go and just reassess Saturday morning to figure out if we should leave that night or if we can push it to Sunday, which I should add, is really dumb, but this trip is pretty important to me (obviously since I'm literally willing to go for one day if need be). "
130," so this is definitely tracking more south per this model, correct? i can't really tell. "
131," it's my last opportunity to go for a very long time because i'm moving up north. it's also an anniversary trip with my long distance partner so at this point, i'm willing to do anything to make it work. "
132, what if i left super late saturday night? like maybe 1 or 2am? would it be any better? 
133, do you know when it's supposed to come out? tbh i'm losing my mind over the stress of this. 
134," i can't give you a clear answer, but I'm planning on doing Disney Friday and Saturday and leaving Sunday morning and a lot of people here and on r/Orlando have told me it's not even worth it to go because it will already be so bad by Sunday morning. "
135, I figured most of Tampa won't be evacuating though considering the storm will mostly miss them. 
136, Planning on driving to Orlando from Atlanta Friday morning through Sunday morning for a short Disney trip before college. Am I going to perish in my car from waiting in bumper to bumper traffic heading to Atlanta early Sunday around 4-5am or will I avoid most of it leaving that early? I have a flight to catch out of Atlanta that same night and it's pretty important I don't miss it. 
137," Hey Tom! I'm driving into Orlando from Atlanta tomorrow morning and will be there until early Sunday for a short Disney trip. As of right now, it seems like my time in Disney shouldn't be too affected, but I'm very worried about the closures and traffic that may happen Sunday morning. I am catching a flight out of Atlanta back to college Sunday night and I'm worried I'll be stuck on the roads getting back to Atlanta. By Sunday morning, is it likely many people will be evacuating or that the storm will already be bad enough that I won't make it back? "
138," There's no chance that the storm could speed up, is there? I'm going to be in Disney for a very short time (Friday afternoon to Sunday morning) and right now, it's looking like I shouldn't be too affected by the storm, but I am wondering the likelihood of it somehow speeding up and hitting much earlier than expected. "
139," I'm driving down tomorrow morning and leaving Sunday morning. Right now, it's not looking like any of those days should be severely affected, right? I'm really stressing myself out over this very very short impromptu Disney trip. "
140," this makes me feel a lot better. ive had similar issues with getting answers about possible heart and stomach problems and im just trying to do my best to calm down about it lately. havent noticed much improvement yet, but i hope it comes and i can write this all off as anxiety. "
141, oof 
142," this is a great description of why i like murakami. ive always agreed with this sort of criticism, but couldnt pinpoint exactly what kept me coming back. he does have incredibly weak character design sometimes, but thats not at all what his books are about. "
143," usually i claim right after my chance as hit just to be sure, but in this particular situation, i don't think 5 should have played a R anyway. "
144, yeah dude 
145," your best bet is probably joining the secret hitler discord and seeing if anyone wants to play with webcams. theres a handful of people who play in voice calls, but ive never personally heard of anyone doing video calls. "
146, been gone for a while 
147, l o l 
148, lol of course T_D is the first sub that shows up on your recently active subs 
149, i received the Richard Cohen after getting accepted before freshman year without any extra application process. i have personally never heard of anyone else receiving that scholarship later in their year. i know about 5 others with that scholarship though which i recognize is not a ton. i suggest calling and asking the financial aid office if they consider you every year for it. 
150, no i love these big bee babies. 
151, i think about this so often. i just hope that somehow i will have gotten over my health anxiety at least somewhat by that point. 
152, fyi i have the Cohen scholarship and you dont have to apply to it separately. you are automatically considered when applying. i also had EFC of 0 and BU covers almost everything for me including housing. 
153, i am INFP and a sociology major 
154," i find that Murakami is super polarizing. honestly, you either like him or you dont. apart from a few novels, most of his stuff has a similar feeling so it may be that hes just not your thing. 

fwiw Kafka is his best novel in my opinion. maybe a close second to Wind Up Bird. "
155, i second this. it's a real journey. 
156," i think a better description is that it's the same ""a"" sound in the word ""apple"" or ""cat"" "
157, I can barely even watch Ben Shapiro videos to be able to critique them because I just cannot stand the sound of this little weasel man. 
158," in my experience, i have not met many gay people at BU. i went to one meeting for one of the LGBT groups on campus and some stuff said there really rubbed me the wrong way. this is obviously only my experience of course, but I have met very few. "
159, so happy to be reminded of this dude. his playthrough of The Cat Lady is probably one of my favorites of all time and i think i watched it through a couple times. i had no clue he was streaming now. 
160, Atlanta would be almost perfect if we just had any semblance of a decent train system. 
161," also hijacking to say this happened to me. dated a girl for 3 years, found out that she was dating someone else the whole last year of it. told me she loved him more than me. 

i had also suspected it but she told me it was just my bpd acting up and that nothing was wrong. "
162," im not really sure about my essays. i figure thats what got me in, but im not completely sure. 

i applied as an english major. "
163, thats super unfortunate. the BUS has come in clutch for me so many times. 
164," wow. that describes my parents to a tee. wouldnt let me leave the house for fear id be kidnapped, but also forgot to feed me/pick me up from school/be good parents in general. 

explains why i have crippling health anxiety. "
165," yeah i definitely didnt think id get in either, but here i am! "
166, i honestly dont understand why people think this. i use the BU bus pretty much every single day and i very very rarely have issues with it. the schedule is not consistent but the GPS tracker on the app is usually right. 
167, i got a 1330 on the SAT and did pretty much no ECs in high school (minus being in my high schools musical three years in a row) and i got in. so i think youre fine. 
168," yes, it is. i think a lot of people are mostly here for networking and stuff. its definitely hard to meet people who just want to be actual friends. "
169," never eaten at any other college campus, so its hard to compare but its not terrible. after a while though, everything starts tasting the same and i get absolutely crazed for real food if i eat all meals at the dining hall for over a week. "
170," i feel you, man. my first two years have been rough and lonely. i'm halfway done though so i'm just toughing it out and hoping that next semester will be better. all i can say is, things change and you never know what good things this coming year has in store for you. "
171, I have four beds in the area so I dont think the lack of beds is an issue. 
172, Ill try to take the bell from the village I got them from and see if it helps! 
173, Hmm maybe I have been too close then. I always give them food and then wait and see if it works. Ill try that since I have everything else! 
174, RemindMe! 7 days 
175," my summer has been pretty uneventful. most of my friends from home have moved away or just grown apart from me so ive mostly just played way too many video games. 

im not excited for the semester to start, but im hoping for the best! my first two years at BU have been nothing less than extremely difficult. hopefully my third will be even a little better! "
176, Ive gotten a tattoo at Stingray and it was a pretty good experience. Id highly recommend Luckys in Cambridge though! Everyone who works there is super sweet and my favorite tattoo artist in Boston works there! 
177, this is the weirdest askreddit thread ive ever read. 
178, oh nice your racism is showing 
179, excuse me what the fuck 
180, I moved to Boston for school and it made me realize how perfect Atlanta is for me. Thankfully I'm back here for the summer to enjoy some heat before it's below freezing from November to April. 
181, just wanted to say thanks for making this post. i get so many symptoms that i think are anxiety related even if i don't feel anxious and it's nearly crippling. it's very helpful to know other people have them too. 
182," second the pewdiepie series. i watched him a ton when i was a kid, but i fell off after that. this series got me back into his stuff and made me redownload minecraft. truly a great series. "
183," i want to begin incorporating more masculine elements into my fashion (things like baggier pants and stuff). think sort of like some of the instagram baddie style or even like a toned down billie eilish style. 

problem is that im 411. is there anywhere online or otherwise that i can shop for loose pants or loose clothing in general while being this short? i dont want to feel like im being swallowed up by things too oversized. "
184, i really resonate with this reply! i also found her in middle school while watching her mtv performance and shes remained such a constant in my life. 
185," Lived in a triple my freshman year and it was great for freshman year, but I wouldn't prefer it after that. It's not awful, but it's not ideal. Some rooms are small and cramped and some rooms are extremely dark and have tiny windows (like i'm talking a slit in the top corner of a room, but that being said, it varies extremely. Almost no room has the same layout. It is very nice to have your own bathroom and to be able to control the temp in the room though.

I met literally one human being who lived in Hojo my freshman year. It is not like the bigger dorms where people are constantly keeping their doors open for friends and stuff. It's quiet there. The common spaces are pretty nice though imo, but no one ever utilizes them. 

Location wise, it's literally perfect depending on where your classes are. It's super close to most of the class buildings and it's right next door to the okay-est dining hall imo. It's also super quick to get to the Charles from there which is a plus. "
186," yep. i was not in a big freshman dorm my freshman year. i literally met one girl on my floor the whole year. when i joined a bunch of clubs to try and make friends, everyone came to the first meetings with groups of people they'd just met on their floor and it was impossible to squeeze into the pre-formed groups. never had an issue making friends until i came here. "
187, so so so thankful ive been able to see her twice during this tour in preparation for the long road ahead without any tour dates 
188," this is probably a bit overdone, but i personally love the Starbucks near Hotel Commonwealth. its great if you live in east and its always considerably less packed than every other Starbucks on campus. the vibe there is much calmer and quieter and i love the seating options. "
189," try to make friends early on. im not sure if this is a BU specific thing, but it seems pretty common for people to create friend groups fast and then be uninterested in continuing to reach out. as one of my friends roommates once said after i asked her why people never talk to each other in the beginning of classes: we arent freshman anymore "
190," next to impossible. i lived in a triple in Hojo my freshman year and there are only a handful of singles that, as far as i know, are only for RAs or students who require larger spaces for physical disabilities. "
191," yep, i was looking for more subtle racism, but i was surprised how overtly this was presented. "
192," Looking back at it, I think I definitely did. I wasn't paying attention and it never directed me to the actual download link so I just thought it was the right one. I wasn't familiar with addfly before this. "
193," this may be an unpopular opinion, but personally, i think German is one of the easiest languages to learn as a native English speaker if you wanna give that a shot. maybe its just because i went from Japanese to German though (and anything is easier than Eastern Asian languages for English speakers). 

otherwise, i would assume ASL is the easiest. "
194," yeah i'm definitely talking about the international overton window. i think, in general, american liberalism falls pretty center for my own beliefs as well as internationally. i have also had many professors fall victim to identity politics. i think it's sort of the direction US leftist politics has been stuck in for a while. "
195," because most ""leftists"" are actually just centrists, especially on wealthy college campuses "
196," has been said a couple times, but damn, a huge chunk of this school has wealth levels i literally didnt even know were possible until moving here. its definitely hard to acclimate to it after coming from a comparatively poor part of the country. "
197," i could be wrong, but i believe that Strangeness and Charm had a demo version that leaked before the full album came out "
198, this is not true. Yang has an immense amount of open support from many right wingers. 
199, yes. Paper Massacre has always been one of my favorite songs of hers and ive been shocked that it seems to be a favorite of many people after she released the last two tracks. 
200, i cannot believe this is an actual thing. ive always felt this way. 
201," yep. i smoked often with friends in high school (couple times a week), but in college, i discovered how great smoking alone was and now im smoking a couple times a day regularly. havent noticed any super bad side effects though. "
202," this is a really harmful mindset. first of all, you'e thinking of eastern Asians (japanese, chinese, etc) and not all Asian Americans, which includes Indians, Cambodians, etc. and second of all, eastern Asian Americans are doing better in certain areas than other minorities or white people, but there's still a lot of racism... "
203, thank you for saying this. racism towards asian americans is so often just untouched in left circles and its disgusting. 
204," youre being downvoted, but i almost agree with you. the number one thing id always wanted to do in Japan was go to the Ghibli museum, but i got the opportunity to go way earlier than i ever anticipated being able to go and the ticket ordering process was so complex. after finally figuring it out, i realized they only sell a small number of tickets a day and that the soonest date was almost 6 months away. 

still had a great time in Japan, but it sucked that the museum was so inaccessible that i couldnt even go. "
205, so happy to see a wild contrapoints viewer on this sub 
206," no question, just wanted to say i am assigned female at birth and am very femme-presenting, but i identify as nonbinary and am okay with any pronouns. to most strangers, i appear female so they use she/her and thats okay but close friends use they/them. 

i was really confused for a while because even though i appear female in many ways (wearing makeup, having long hair, etc), i feel very masculine sometimes and it never feels right to identify as female (or male for that fact). 

you do you. theres so many people who say shit like oh you cant change your gender, but fuck em. gender is such a deeply personal thing and tbh, i think you can and should be able to give it any label you wish and change as you learn and grow. good luck!!! "
207," confuses me that people pay to volunteer, but whatever floats your boat i guess "
208, I'm '98 and I also put maybe 
209," im not religious at all, but commenting this is so fucking pointless. if god is meaningful to OP, who are you to tell them god doesnt exist? "
210," this school is around $72,000 per student including room and board lol. i do not give a flying fuck about taking some small meals from the dining hall. when youre broke as shit about to run out of meal swipes or when you have severe anxiety that limits your ability to constantly go to the dining hall, you do what you gotta do. "
211," i can't imagine experiencing the death of a loved one like that. i've been in mostly all long distance relationships so this hit very hard for me. i hope you're doing okay now and regardless, you are so lucky to have loved and been loved by him. "
212," well i did bring up both all of georgia and new orleans, but alright. i dont know when immigrants became the only way diversity exists. "
213," okay boyo, i wasnt doubting your own experiences and im sorry youve experienced racism in the south, but i was just saying that you were incorrect when saying the south wasnt diverse. you cant just make up facts to support your own experiences, nor can you assume my own experiences. 

boston may have more immigrant communities, i wouldnt know, but to say atlanta has none is, again, just incorrect. there are many places in atlanta where immigrants dont even need to learn english perfectly and/or have forgotten it because of how tight knit the communities of immigrants are. for example, korean is spoken more in georgia than in any other state in the US. thats just one example. its honestly really gross that youre just coming up with shit. 

and no culture??? new orleans has no culture when jazz music was literally born there?? pfft, okay. shoot me some real facts and we will talk. "
214," the south is more demographically diverse than the north, but okay. boston is one of the most segregated cities in the US. "
215," i don't know man, the south is the most diverse region of the US. i've seen more bigotry, racism, and sexism since moving to Boston than i've ever ever seen in my hometown of Atlanta. i guess maybe i just don't associate with racist or sexist people, but i don't necessarily associate with racist, sexist people in Boston either, but i still see way more of it. "
216, the men of Georgia have nothing to do with the abortion laws...the people in power in Georgia do. people seem to forget the south is not entirely bigots and racists. 
217," i think it's different for everyone, but i heard about my summer swap in mid July last year "
218," so lucky. i got straight across bangs recently too and they look so good, but they require constant maintenance and look so terrible if i don't purposefully blowdry and straighten them everyday. "
219, i would highly recommend Lungs. its how i discovered her almost ten years ago now and it still is my favorite album. i think i didnt listen to anything else for almost six months after i first heard it. 
220," cant help, but i wanna know what you got stuck with lol "
221, saw her in atlanta on the 6th and she also performed Youve Got the Love! maybe it just got added to the tour! 
222, whats the source for this? i cannot imagine him saying something like this. 
223, oof go back to 4chan 
224," dude i'm gonna assume you haven't been to south africa, but the discrimination against black people is way worse there than it even is here... "
225, then why would anyone want him to see it? its not for him to see. you just said that lol 
226, why is this on the pewdiepie subreddit? its not related to him nor is it something he could even relate to given that hes like almost 30 and not american... 
227, interesting to see that most people here cross their sevens to distinguish them from other numbers. i actually started crossing my 7s in late high school because i just thought it looked nicer lol 
228, it could be just because Lungs was the only thing out when i first discovered Florence. damn i really only listened to that album for like a year. something about how raw and almost unfinished it sounds just really hits me. 
229," unpopular opinion on this sub, but i genuinely cant imagine her making an album i like more than Lungs. "
230, thanks for this rec! been looking for a new podcast to listen to and this is right up my alley. 
231," DAMN just always comes back to the best album for me. every time i start forgetting about it, a song from it pops up somewhere and then i fall back in love with the whole album all over again. "
232," good choice! it was hard for me too, but i went with Lust "
233, I visited Tokyo last winter and specifically looked for Murakami things and never came across even a reference of him. I dont think theres a lot of demand for merchandise really. 
234, this is beautiful. im so glad to know she was happy through the last times in her life. 
235," sorry in advance if this comes off rude or anything, but what is the practical reason for bras with AAs? i only ask because im a no bra kinda gal because my Cs just sort of handle themselves without much support. i just feel like all bras are uncomfortable so i assumed most girls with smaller boobs would just avoid them entirely. "
236," I was referred to a ton of places, called every single one of them, and was only able to get an intake appointment with one 2 months from when I called. When I went to my intake appointment, they told me they could only connect me to a psychiatrist (which is not what I needed), but I went anyway. The psychiatrist also said they wouldn't be helpful to me and put me on a 7 month waitlist before I finally got a decent-ish therapist.

tl;dr BU does not prioritize their students' mental health nor do they refer to decent providers. "
237, lol 
238," oh wow i knew this post gave off a similar vibe to the ""Soul Purpose"" sign. every time i pass by that sign, i always make a remark. i really like it. "
239," i wasn't insinuating that the same people who feel threatened by the hats are the ones making the other harassment claims. i haven't had any negative interactions with guards and would definitely look the other way at a MAGA hat, but now? i don't know, it would def make me uncomfortable knowing they've said shit to other students. "
240," it makes people feel unsafe. i'd be fine with it if there weren't harassment complaints on top of it, but there are so it's reason to make people feel unsafe. "
241," if you read the descriptions, some are in towers and west, so no, it's not just warren. "
242, im currently struggling with the idea that i peaked in high school because of my lack of friendships and fun going into my third year of college and this made me feel way less alone. 
243," this is absolutely a problem, but i'm kind of surprised how poorly this is organized if it was really sent to Brown. at least put consistently which dorms these are happening in. "
244,  
245, quality post 
246," this story really struck a chord in me. i've been through very similar situations and i hope you are doing better now. it took me until 18 to tell anyone as well and i'm in university now, about to need to take a year off for the same reasons. thanks for sharing your story and making at least one person feel less alone. "
247," there's nothing i can say to you really, but there are others who understand this feeling perfectly. i've been in two very serious long relationships that i poured my whole being into. relationships i was certain would last, so certain that it might have been the only thing i was sure of. i'm still dealing with the ends of both of them, but please give yourself time. it's so important to not rush the healing. "
248, i am sitting in a crowded cafe in the dead middle of the day and i'm still somehow absolutely freaked out by this comment. easily the scariest thing here. i don't know how i wouldn't lose my mind if i saw that. 
249, Might want to get rid of the double barrel questions. Its pretty confusing. 
250," Yeah seconding the other response, its an absolute shitshow in there. I applied for accommodations at the end of my freshman year and only received an email granting me accommodations at the end of my sophomore year. Mine was for mental health reasons so maybe thats why they were so slow, but I would recommend getting on it as soon as possible. "
251," When I visited Tokyo, I actually stayed at a hotel in this district and there are literally stores upon stores just for fake plastic food. There are really small ones on keychains for tourists and stuff, but they're pretty expensive (like $30 US dollars for a keychain sized food). You can literally find one for almost any food and they're so realistic that it's insane. "
252," I think most of those letters are given to her at shows. Ive seen her live twice and was once right up against the barrier. At the end of the show, she came down into the crowd and people were giving her tons of things. Some people even gave her things during the show, but most seemed to wait until the end. "
253," I usually buy most of my groceries at the Star Market in Fenway or in Allston depending on whats most convenient for me that day. Sometimes I just go to Target for smaller runs. 

I dont use Instacart because its too expensive. "
254, i just finished my second year of college and i feel like im barely alive. everyday is a struggle to not drop out. this gave me a bit of hope. 
255, this makes me really afraid for my future sex life. ive never ever had sex that felt like it was a chore or someone who seemed uninterested or unwilling to tell me what they like. 
256," I would highly recommend most lower level Sociology courses (like either 100 or a 200 level). I may be biased as a Sociology major, but so many of the classes are taught by people doing incredible amounts of field work in the subject. The best part is hearing the professors back up class material with their own studies. 

I cant remember any course numbers, but Sex and Sociology was pretty light and interesting with a small class size. SOC 100 with Mears is a great intro class, but its usually pretty big so not much discussion happens. Sociology of Race and Ethnicity is super interesting if you care about race relations and my discussion TA for that class was probably one of my favorite faculty members at BU "
257, lol no wonder both of your wives divorced you 
258," ...its not true. There are many men who wouldnt be happy with just sex. Its such a simple mindset. If a man feels that way, he needs to grow up. Men dont crave sex any more than women, its just more acceptable for them to. "
259," Yes, absolutely! Shoot me a dm! "
260," My partner of 2.5 years broke up with me at the beginning of this school year and it destroyed me. We were long distance the whole time and I was halfway through school so we were halfway to finally living in the same place. It was a devastating blow to me and I felt like I lost all sense of direction since my whole time here had been filled with thoughts of how wed soon live together. Every bad day I had, I thought, Well at least its a day closer to being together so it was something that sort of became my purpose in life. 

I say this to tell you that the other responses of Just love your new freedom are absolutely great responses, but you may just need time before you can really begin to accept those truths and actively work towards them and thats okay. Its been almost a year since my partner left me and I still am working at moving on. Its taken a lot for me to realize thats okay and that its not weird if I still have weekly cries about it. Tiny steps become easier and suddenly bigger and bigger ones seem easier. 

I recommend just giving yourself time. Take care of yourself. A lot of the active steps will come with time. "
261, This is such a toxic mindset. 
262," I actually tried these, but for some reason, theyre so noticeable on me. You can clearly see the thickness of them through my shirt and it almost looks weirder than if I just let me nipples show. "
263," I recently got a few white crop tops for the summer and I'm having trouble wearing them without my nipples showing. I never wear actual bras and I'm at a loss for how to wear these shirts without seeing the very distinct color of my areolas. I have a couple bralettes and even a nude one, but the lacy fabric shows the texture through the tight shirt and it looks awful.   
Does anyone know where I could get a super simple nude bralette (the less fabric, the better) that doesn't have lace or any sort of texture that would show through a tight shirt? "
264, It wasnt until I saw this post on r/conservative that I realized that you cant even comment on any thread in that sub without proving youre a conservative...wow what a vacuum of opinions in there. 
265, Have you ever seen any British commentators? This is a typical interview. Theyre always being dry and cutting. Hes lucky he didnt get interviewed by anyone else because the interviewer was being hella soft on him. 
266," Oh I had no idea! Sorry for the misinformation, Im never in West. "
267," And I mostly agree with you, but the red flags in this guy's post and post history has most commentors understandably freaked out. I don't think anyone is saying this woman isn't capable of taking care of herself, but it's scary some of the shit this guy has said. It's not impossible for a 27 year old woman to be abused, manipulated, etc. I don't know if OP is going to do that, by any means, but he's got some pretty fucked ideas that are leading me and others to believe he is the sort of dom people tell subs to never get involved with.

Also, not to mention the fact that he doesn't really want advice. He has only responded to the comments that affirm what he already wants to hear. "
268, Only Dominos takes dining points and theyre equivalent to real dollars so you can just see the prices online when youre ordering it. 
269," this is a great comment. thanks for so concisely pointing out all the reasons this is fucked. as a young woman who has had a lot of experience with abusive older men parading as doms, this dude is fucking terrifying. "
270," I don't know, dude, maybe look at how much you're being downvoted and consider that you could be wrong. You've got this attitude of ""I'm the man in charge, I may have made this post asking for advice, but I don't need it because I'm the dommy dom"". Don't make a post asking for advice and then only accept the shit that just confirms your own beliefs. There are millions of red flags here, from you being overly pompous and boastful to you saying you're in charge as the dom.

I mean, do whatever you want. You're obviously going to anyway. "
271," youre very strangely pompous about all of this. so many red flags. 

first of all, orgasm control is not for all women and i would really suggest you not pull out all of the stops when you both first sleep together. and secondly, she can and should be able to change her mind even if you are already in her. what if it does hurt her? what if she has second thoughts. just because youre already in her doesnt mean you dont need consent throughout.

also feels very obvious that you are only responding to comments that praise you or that you can respond to with your insane sexual prowess. "
272," This is very reassuring, thank you! "
273," I'm generally pretty on time with my BC, but there was one day this week that I forgot to take it before bed as usual and instead took it about 12 hours later the next day. I guess it's possible that was enough to upset it. "
274, I'm going back home to Georgia and I'm working at my partner's after school SAT/ACT tutoring company part time and doing nothing else at all. 
275," i think very few left leaning individuals have a problem with right leaning organizations. at least i would hope thats the case. there are groups on campus for republicans and conservatives and thats absolutely fine, but when you have this organization with admin saying actively alt right shit, thats when its a problem. TPUSA is not just a right leaning organization, its an organization with white supremacist ideals. "
276," yes, I agree that being aware of politics is draining and harmful, but you also have to realize that you have an immense amount of privilege to be able to not care. its not affecting you directly and putting your life at risk, so you can get away with not caring. many people have to care whether they want to or not. "
277, i dont think its Saturday just because i know that some people have finals that day. finals week doesnt technically end until after Saturday. 
278," im genuinely confused by this response. i feel like you dont know the history of the phrase white pride. 

minorities arent proud to be minorities because of the color of their skin, but because of the fact that they have survived and existed and done great things regardless of the systematic racism in the US. when white people have white pride, its specifically because of the color of their skin...which yes, is racist. excluding having pride for being like italian, german, etc. white people, as a group of people with the same skin tone, have nothing to be proud of when it comes to their race. nationality, yes. color of skin, lack of melanin, no. "
279, i would ask the same question but for completely opposite reasons. i think May is honestly one of the more fascinating characters. i took a Japanese lit class once where we read Wind Up Bird and someone wrote an entire essay on reasons why they thought she was actually fake and just existed as a projection of Torus thoughts. it was interesting. 
280, lol why would anyone want to talk to anyone in an organization with members who openly say shit like that? no thank you. 
281, oof this post reminded me that white supremacists (or white supremacy apologists and justifiers) go to this school. 
282, wow i had this same experience discovering this sub during a crazy bout of googling. my health anxiety has definitely calmed since finding it and i hope it can help you too! 
283," This is a great idea, I'll try it out next time! "
284," I'm not the best by any means, but I like having fun with new looks \~ I also don't wear any face makeup mostly because I suck at it and I like my skin's natural complexion!

Product List:

Freck fake freckle makeup

Colourpop eyeshadow in Poodle (also used for blush)

Colourpop eyeshadow in Liar, Liar

Eyeko liquid eyeliner in black

Tarte Maneater mascara

Maybelline Total Temptation brow definer in Deep Brown "
285," wow i honestly would have never thought something like this would look good, but damn, it looks awesome! "
286," i would say dont do it if you didnt attend the class. they arent mandatory, but they do help the professor a lot. its encouraged but if you never went, then it doesnt matter. "
287," I think most do just because it sucks living in a triple. As a freshman, anything is better than the main freshman dorms and sharing a bathroom with the floor, so 575 is fine, but as a sophomore, you probably want less roommates. "
288," I got 575 Comm Ave no problem my freshman year along with a handful of other freshman. It's not wellknown to most incoming freshman and I think most higher years try to avoid it if they can because it's fine as a freshman, but no one wants it as a sophomore. I think you have a pretty good chance. "
289, lol yes i feel exactly the same except since like the first semester of my freshman year 
290, you have absolutely no idea how ready i am. im still a lil bitch when it comes to the cold. 
291, About to finish my second year of college in Boston where it is currently 40F and Im just so excited to come back home to the HEAT!! 
292," repeating what someone else said, but going to the bathroom is a super stressful experience if you dont identify as the gender you were assigned at birth. trans people are most likely to be harassed in the bathroom than anywhere else. "
293," damn, i would have loved to have seen it then. "
294," yeah definitely removed :/ 

it was gender neutral for most of the semester though. it only recently changed. "
295," Be careful if you go now. It used to be easy and fairly low risk, but early 2018, some asshole burned a shit ton of tires there and now it's heavily patrolled and there's a huge fine. I would personally never go now. "
296," How long ago was this? I used to go a ton between 2015-2017 and I never saw anything super in tact. A couple bed frames and a chair or two, but that was it. "
297," Damn, I remember going to visit this place every summer when I was in high school. Tried to go again last summer, but apparently it's heavily guarded now since somebody set a fuck ton of tires on fire sometime during early 2018. Used to be that you could just stroll right in and you'd usually always see some photographers getting nice shots. 

Sounds weird to say, but this place was such a big part of my high school years. "
298," im pretty sure it didnt. that was closest convenience store to me the entire time ive gone to BU and i think they didnt even take convenience points, but i could be wrong "
299, im so glad someone said this. i feel like no one knows about this amazing game. 
300," pretty sure you can bring whatever furniture you like, you just cant remove anything from the room. "
301," I think a lot of people who look very normal also have social anxiety....

Also what the hell is abnormal clothing?? "
302," I order food through Ubereats or Postmates usually only like once or twice a week on days where I'm just too exhausted to leave my room, but other than that, it's way too expensive to do it for every meal. We're talking like $20-25 per meal. "
303," this is really cool! and from one internet stranger to another, good on you for taking control of your life. so few people realize you can just start over when you need to. its not easy but its possible and youre hella strong for making this change. "
304, My parents never told me to drink water growing up. I was definitely that 1 in 5. They put soda in my sippy cups and I honestly probably drank water once a week if that. I didnt regularly drink water (because I didnt know) until I was like 17-18. 
305, This is so cool! Would love to see Atlanta! 
306," if literally one wrong thing goes in recycling, the whole thing has to be thrown out. i guarantee maybe 1 dumpster of recycled material actually gets recycled every week. "
307," the only problem is if you dont finish your drink in approx. 7 minutes, the straw becomes soggy and starts basically falling apart. "
308," Yes, this is a great way to buy from sites like those too. There are probably thousands of Youtube reviews online of items from there. Just make sure you find one where they explicitly state that the views are actually theirs, because a lot of time, sites like that will pay them to say whatever. 

Also there are often photos in the reviews on their sites. I usually wont buy unless theres a couple of girls with my rough body type wearing it. "
309," Seconding what u/Gravemonera said. Forever 21 is also pretty good for thigh highs, as well as thinner ones that aren't sheer, but are breathable enough for the upcoming warmer months. 

I'm pretty short so I'm not sure how well this could work for you, but I have some thigh highs that go insanely high on my legs and so you can't even see where the sock ends because the skirt covers it. In theory, they look like tights, but they're still open on the top so you can get to your straps. So maybe you could specifically look for very tall socks. "
310," I regularly buy from Shein and Romwe. The quality is really varied and for the most part, only buy things with loads of reviews. Chances are the stuff without reviews might not even be the same item and it's just not worth it. It limits you a lot, but I've gotten a lot of cheap, decently okay quality things and it's just overall really good if you're really tight on money. "
311," i know you mentioned natural fibers which i cant attest to, but surprisingly amazon has some absolutely great options for pleated schoolgirl type skirts like this. i found one brand on amazon that makes them in like 50 different colors and patterns and i own around 10 of them. "
312, your mother would refuse to see her child graduate because of her political views??? 
313," tbh i dont feel it here. i definitely know some queer people at BU, but the community at large feels very made up of students from other universities. 

ive had a few bad experiences with some of the lgbt clubs on campus, that though not super serious, made me feel uncomfortable in that group and ive heard echoes of that from other students. 

that being said, im sure you could find a community here in boston, but it might not be through BU. just my experience tho "
314, same for me!! i think my parents didnt want us hearing the in game conversations and explicit music? i very distinctly remember playing san andreas and playing my britney spears cd as background music. 
315, what is the name of this organization? 
316," I'm sorry dude, but BU is not worth the money and I think most people who go here and enjoy it would say the same thing. I don't know how much you'd get if you came (if anything), but at 70k times 4? that's a fuck load of money in the end.

I would absolutely not be going here if I didn't get the scholarship I got. "
317," it honestly wasnt as bad as i expected. the professor was very knowledgeable and an easy grader. it was more about how vampires represented sexual taboos which was actually pretty interesting. 

we didnt read twilight which is what everyone joked about. we did watch buffy the vampire slayer though hahah "
318," depends on the college. i am in CAS and went to the last orientation session, but i had an advisor reach out to me and ask what i wanted to take and then they scheduled it and sent me my schedule. 

fair warning that i did have an 8am every single day and the writing class they put me in was about vampires ???? so it was kind of shitty. "
319," Honestly? I do, but I'm trying to make the best of it here.

I just moved too far away from my brother who I should be supporting and I don't have enough time on top of classes to work a second job. 

It's also pretty difficult to make friends here because of the size of campus and all that. "
320, that would genuinely make replaying old maps so much fun. 
321, this is wild. i think i may have never lost a game on ilios. something about that map just works so well for me. 
322," im also someone who loves assault maps. control is whatever and i despise escort maps. 

tbh though, i think its mostly just preference for the map layouts themselves and less so about the game modes. "
323," i am the exact opposite. i feel like if i dont smoke everyday, i wake up with absolutely no motivation to do work. i think knowing that i get to relax with a bowl when im through really helps push me through the day. 

glad you were able to take a break and find some extra energy from it! "
324," I bought it online so I could return it. However, Im very small in general and it was the closest to my measurements I could find that was within my price range and the style I wanted, so even if I returned it, I wouldnt be able to get anything better. "
325, ...I've been cold in Myles lately. I literally have my space heater on right now. Feels like my room is always a bit cold. 
326, you live in a much different world than i do if you think a young girl would be comfortable speaking publicly about being kidnapped. the internet allows her to remain anonymous and safe. how do you not understand this? 
327," totally plausible. ive heard of a few people having them. fair warning though, the internet at BU is spotty. its fast as hell, but it also spikes pretty often which is so annoying when playing online. "
328," i mean, i do think india should work towards fixing these things, but theres no immediate way to do that. it just felt dehumanizing to me. i think it goes past bashing india as a country and cuts too deep to the actual people suffering in the country. i dont think its something to joke about especially as a white guy with loads of money... "
329," agreed. i do think the lines about poverty and the caste system were suppppperrrr off color and not cool at all, but if what they care about is that stupid insult, thats ridiculous. "
330, oof dat formatting 
331, same. ive called many a hotline in my day and ive never ever gotten a single person who sounded like they cared an ounce. ive been put on hold and hung up on numerous times. ive learned now that calling them just upsets me further because i tried to reach out and failed. 
332," jeans mostly, but i also am looking into getting into the printed pants craze going on right now! "
333," my multiple questions marks were intended as sort of baffled confusion. no issue with the OP of the comment spending that money on shoes, i was just shocked that it seems normal. "
334, i will look into this!!! thank you so much. 
335, I need serious help finding pants that fit. I am a short girl (411) with a bit of curves and all the pants I own are too long or are baggy in the legs. Where can I buy fitted pants??? 
336, whew was not expecting that price tag. people spend this much money on shoes???? 
337," from personal experience, they just credit the extra money from the scholarship to your account so you can use it for tuition or convenience points or just get it refunded to your bank. "
338, same. i started the survey and then stopped because there was never that option. 
339," i took a sociology of human sexuality course my first semester at BU and it was pretty interesting!

i also took a wr150 course on music from the 70s which was a super cool topic but the professor (barents) was kinda meh "
340, i posted a super long review of the pro's and con's of it here if you're interested: https://www.reddit.com/r/BostonU/comments/b6bczh/housing_recommendation_for_incoming_freshmen/ejj9w6u?utm_source=share utm_medium=web2x 
341, maybe like once a month if that. i dont know of any parties/events that happen really excluding frat parties which i dont like.  
342, because it sucks if you arent wealthy 
343," as an introvert, being in a freshman dorm my first year would have made me lose my mind. i was in hojo and even though i definitely didnt make any friends because of that, truthfully i think warren or west would have been a lot worse for me in terms of having peace and quiet. 

this is a super unpopular opinion and warren/west might be best for you, but i just wanted to add another perspective! "
344," i dont know dude, shitting on india for their poverty is pretty blatantly racist. i was with him on the whole joke thing for a long time, but i just feel like its not even funny. its a real issue in india and people die at alarming rates because of it. its not something to joke about.  "
345," hate to be this person, but even if it wasnt pewds line, its still in a song he published and put on his channel. not saying i agree or disagree with it being racist but to say pewdiepie didnt say it and someone else did is kind of pointless "
346," if they want to come/you want them to come, orientation is fine. its definitely not necessary for them to come though. move in is difficult alone, but not impossible.  "
347," i also had this problem as a freshman because i basically had to sell my car if i couldnt bring it to boston and there was just no way around it. its expensive to get a parking pass at BU anyway, but i really didnt want to get rid of my car. i ended up having to anyway because the cost of parking it off campus would have broken the bank.  "
348, rec weed is legal here. just go off campus (not hard) and be a little discreet. never been a problem.  
349, my room 
350," i dont know dude. im not pulling 7-8 hour calls everyday but im in an ldr and on the weekends, we sometimes spend the whole day together just over skype. like from morning until night. its the only way we can spend a day together.  "
351," theres AC in hojo (575 Commonwealth) and its 100% possible to get in as a freshman, but it is not a freshman dorm. nice to have AC and your own bathroom, but its way less social than Warren/West if thats what youre looking for.  "
352," Lived in 575 (Hojo) my freshman year.

Cons:
its hard to make friends easily if you live in hojo. its mostly sophomores so no one really leaves their doors open to make friends like they do in warren or west. there are no real common areas that are regularly used so its just a very quiet dorm in general. 

some of the rooms have very small windows so theyre often quite dark and dont let in a lot of natural light. not all the rooms are like this though and some have pretty big windows. 

almost all of the rooms are triples so the space is quite tight in the rooms. again not all of the rooms are the same so there are some that arent bad and if you rearrange furniture, its possible to make it feel more open. the doubles also arent so bad 

Pros:
you get your own bathroom for the room. this also means you have to clean it and provide supplies for it like toilet paper and stuff. not gonna lie though, its so nice to not have to share a bathroom with the floor. 

you have AC and can control the temperature of your room. most dorms dont have AC and though its only hot enough to need it in the first and last couple weeks of school, its nice as hell to have it. its also nice to be able to control the heat in the winter. 

Overall, i liked hojo for a freshman dorm. the cons didnt bother me too much and the pros made it worth it to me. 
 "
353," The 8-9 floors of Myles facing the river have pretty decent views, though not as good as Stuvi obviously.  "
354, no need to go out of your way to prove your point. maybe im just misremembering.  
355, There was only one during last spring semester and it was like walking on the trail a 40-minute T ride away (they did it twice i think) which was cool and I went but the rest were too expensive for me. maybe there are more cheap ones now? 
356," i was only in the club for a semester, but from my experience, there are a couple of really cheap things (20-50) and a ton of really expensive ones. i stopped going to meetings because most of the trips were too expensive for me.  "
357," I was at the Charles River in Boston once and someone had their dog off of its leash and it attacked one of the geese close to the water. I think it was okay (it didnt have any visible injuries at least), but it just sat there still and kept making the same awful honking noise. Eventually a huge flock of about 6-7 geese cane swooping in all making the same noise and chased me away from it. They were really aggressive and it felt very much like they thought I had hurt it. They were so caring to the injured one and were literally lifting its wings and looked to be checking for injuries. It was really an amazing thing to see.  "
358," hey i went through a very similar situation last year and i cant say this will for sure work since mine was a bit different as i was just trying to guarantee a single for the coming school year for mental health reasons. 

you have to do most of the work and its fucking awful. try to get back into see a therapist at SHS, explain your situation and how serious it is that you get out asap. it might be rough trying to get in an appointment within the next month, but if you say its serious, they will usually take you seriously. 

make sure to get a letter from your therapist stating exactly why you need to get switched out immediately. i think theres a specific form on the ods website for mental health accommodations but your therapist should be able to tell you about this. 

then you gotta basically pester the shit out of the office of disability. they are awful at taking mental health into consideration in my experience and you have to just bother them enough until they believe you. i was able to secure a single for this year because of that and it was so shitty but it worked.  "
359," i feel like for some reason, the world just doesn't want me to get therapy lol. i've called every number SHS has given me and it's all been waitlists. i just picked the shortest one, then when my appt was supposed to happen, my therapist got sick and i was back on the waitlist. also, i'm a broke bitch and $10 a week is a lot for me right now. "
360," im on a waitlist for multiple outside sources as ive already done the short term therapy (one semester) through BU. i cant afford therapy even with the BU insurance so even if i get off the waitlist, i likely wont be able to do it.  "
361," i also dont want to have a mean response back, but please dont assume my situation. i have tried to get the help i needed. ive been on a therapy waitlist for seven months and the office of disabilities is unable to work with me without a diagnosis even though ive explained my situation repeatedly. i have absolutely no contact with my parents. maybe for you, an educational institute could not have that effect on you, but BU has been no help to me at all no matter how much urgency i express to them. i have no family to help me and no friends here and am completely on my own to figure this out.  "
362," yes i feel this way too. ive tried to join clubs and talk to people in classes, but i still have no real friends. i spend every weekend alone in my room. im trying to transfer out because this school has destroyed my mental health, but its looking like it wont happen so im stuck here unless i decide to drop out.  "
363, got summer swapped last year into a myles single from a hojo triple. anything is possible.  
364, i love just doing whatever i normally do. makes it so much more interesting. going down long youtube rabbit holes is one of my favorites while stoned.  
365," exact same situation for me. i feel so grateful to have gotten a good scholarship, but i just wish it had been to a different school.  "
366, newsflash: it isnt.  
367, i agree with this. im a biological female who identifies as non-binary and i did not expect for the survey to end automatically.  
368," Fins in east has pretty great ramen and good Japanese food in general but it is a little pricier than most things on campus. 

also Pho Countryside in east is super good too! "
369, its a rumble in the jungle... 
370, dude its pretty blatant that the article is over exaggerating everything tho 
371," im so glad you said this. i saw this post before it had any comments and i was going to comment saying this, but worried id be obliterated. 

this article is really mincing words here and its obviously biased. i didnt go to this talk and ive never seen any of her talks before and though the quotes (honestly not even sure if theyre accurate because this article is terrible and obviously has an agenda) are quite hyperbolic, everything shes saying is pretty true.  "
372," you'll have no problem getting either. you have one of the best numbers possible

 #x200B; "
373," i honestly think that it is no longer something to beat yourself up over. you were a kid with no knowledge about blackface. how could you have known any differently?

the important thing is that you recognize it is bad now and move forward with that knowledge.  "
374," i went to her show in boston and i didn't get there super early, maybe an hour before doors opened and somehow i was easily able to squeeze to front and center against the barrier. i think that i was extremely lucky though. "
375," lol i take it youve never tried, otherwise you wouldnt be suggesting this "
376, i originally got a triple on bay state as a rising sophomore. my roommate had a decent number but not great.  
377," i dont know about a mens restroom, but theres a womens restroom to the right of the tsai. like if youre walking in the main doors of cas, turn right, walk up those half stairs, theres a bathroom on the left. no one ever uses it.  "
378," yes of course, but posts like this are so stupid because this happens so rarely. its always just used to say oh every person lies about rape. totally unnecessary. yes, it happens, but actual rape happens so much more often. 

also i fucking hate this sub now. why is this even on here? "
379, lol nope because i did the 330-250 swap and i still have like $1500 (and also i only ever spend like 6-8 for each meal?) 
380, i wrote about my home life and how i was able to get decent grades regardless of not having a lot of support. just write about something that youve been able to do well in spite of. thats always a good option.  
381, wow this is wild. lungs will always be the best album and i actually like all of the top three songs considerably less than any of the others from those albums.  
382," tell me about it. even the dining halls are ridiculously packed at almost all hours. at this point, ill always eat alone in my room if i can help it.  "
383, yeah i think this professor is totally new to BU because she had no reviews on ratemyprofessor 
384, just a warning to this. im taking lx250 this year with iovtcheva and its fucking rough. the whole class has no idea what is going on and weve all just accepted were failing the midterm. no idea about any other professors though.  
385," yep. i get pretty serious side effects if im not very on time with my birth control and it seems literally every time i get the text saying my prescription is ready, they fill the generic version of my birth control (which ive tried to take and it destroyed me). this requires me to wait however it long it takes for them to get the right one which is anywhere from 15 minutes to a whole 24 hours or they send me on a hunt to find a CVS with it in stock. 

just last week, i had to go to the CVS in fenway but not in the target to get the right one and i commented to the pharmacist there that im always all over the city trying to get this medication and he goes why didnt they just put a note in your file that you cant take this generic version? and i was dumbfounded. ive been dealing with this for almost two years and all it took was for them to make a note of it.  "
386," i have gotten something similar my whole life, usually also on my fingers. ive always noticed them but they always eventually go away and i never have like more than one at a time. i barely notice them now and they havent killed me so youre probably fine.  "
387," yes dude, you basically have to be involved with the yakuza to get weed in japan. obviously there are other ways, but like thats the main way. 

source: was in japan for a couple weeks and did extensive research on how to obtain weed and decided against being jailed in a foreign country where i barely spoke the language "
388, wow this honestly is the most helpful post ive ever read on this sub. this is going to help a lot to think about when im anxious about stuff like this.  
389, wow i had no idea other high schools used this. seeing it randomly on my reddit feed really threw me off because this bulldog was all over my school.  
390," i have mental issues myself, but i often feel like if i bring them up even slightly with acquaintances, they seem confused or just like weird about it. it makes me feel pretty isolated because i feel like i cant find anyone here who understands what its like to have mental illnesses. its sort of a necessity to have a close friend for them to understand or at least attempt to understand any mental health issues you have without being judgmental or just brushing it off awkwardly.  "
391, i actually feel like it seems like no one at BU has mental health problems.  
392," not really a way to get out of it necessarily, but like a good chunk of the time, it gets cancelled for whatever reason anyway. every single person ive known at BU, including me, who got a jury duty summons ended up getting it cancelled the day before.  "
393," yep, if you get enough financial aid, they just waive it for you.  "
394," when i first saw Peters face and story in line at a coffee shop before my next class, i broke down. there was something so heart wrenching to me thinking this freshman boy thought to put his life on the line to save people. what an absolute hero. my heart hurts again this morning for this beautiful person.  "
395, im a queer lady and tbh this is like the main thing i get off to 
396, oh my god i hate this subreddit now.  
397," what about the dining halls screams perfect sanitation to you anyway? the food is under/over cooked, the salad bar utensils are always fully in the veggies and peoples hands have been all over that.  "
398, lol i dont know if pulling a r/iamverysmart is going to work very well but good luck 
399," i mean yeah i agree with you. holistic applications are super weird to me altogether and practically nowhere else in the world does them besides the US, but you gotta do what you gotta do, man. im almost certain i got my scholarship from writing about my sob story. i felt super disgusting using it like that, but tbh would probably not be going here if i didnt.  "
400, i dont know dude. everyone i know milked the shit out of their sob stories and it got them pretty far.  
401," same, id be super interested if it was about more games! "
402, of course they are. we have some of the most terrible housing options ive ever seen even compared to much lower rank and cheaper schools.  
403, ...but hes saying you can do this without it being emasculating.  
404," because theres just one kitchen. realistically, it would be unusable if every single person in myles was using it at all times to feed themselves.  "
405," try tweeting or dm-ing @budiningservices. they can usually take requests for things like this.

 #x200B; "
406," who cares tho? if they wanna spend their money on strippers, thats on them.  "
407," i have a single right now in myles and i genuinely love it. no complaints except for my room being pretty small (though no room is the same so it might be better for you), but even still, its not bad at all. 

i dont really take advantage of the kitchen or the game room or other plethora of rooms they have, but ive heard good things about them.  "
408," its definitely something ive never done before. so far, it isnt hard, but the assignments absolutely take some time to go through just because its not the type of work i, or most people, are used to.  "
409," to be fair, they can look super realistic and nice if done correctly with the right product "
410," wow fuck no one ever understood why that one scared me, but i did the same thing. thinking about it now freaks me out so bad.  "
411," im a girl in a long term relationship with a guy. 

overwhelmingly and without hesitation, yes it is perfectly fine and absolutely normal unless the amount someone is getting off is affecting their productivity or harming their relationships with others.  "
412, that's fair. i'm sure that's hella frustrating. thanks for talking about this perspective though because i'd genuinely never heard of or met a deaf person who saw their deafness as just a different way to experience the world! i'll definitely be more careful in future conversations about addressing it as a disability or anything like that. 
413," i'm not deaf, so i can't speak on everyone's experience, but just because you don't have any desire to hear doesn't mean everyone who is deaf doesn't. i agree with the fact that it shouldn't be looked at as something every deaf person wants to be ""fixed"", but you can't ignore the people who do see it as a hindrance to their life and would love to be able to have the option. "
414," some people have shitty parents who are not at all involved in their lives. in my experience, that seems more common than having a parent who can be aware of everything going on in their child's life.

(to be fair as well, this was less a relationship because the guy in question was like 30, but she felt they were in love and all that...) "
415," shit happens. my ex girlfriend was in an abusive sexual relationship at 13. its fucked up, but it happens.  "
416," yes!! i really give weed a ton of credit for helping me grow to understand myself better and figure out whats important in life. its unfortunate that weed has sparked a bit of an anxiety peak in the past six months for me, but before then, it was great for me.  "
417," as a frequent weed user, this is super frightening as i have often fallen into anxiety spirals and felt like id have a heart attack while high.  "
418, its hella easy to get hojo as a freshman. most freshman dont try for it and theres always hella spaces after sophomores pick.  
419," the sad reality is that to be in the health profession, youll most likely have to sit through lectures before you can get hands on experience.  "
420, got hella lucky with a pretty big need based financial aid scholarship. i pay about 3k a year mostly for BUs insurance plan and a little extra for a single room instead of having roommates.  
421," yeah it's a rough line for me to draw too. often times, researching does help me calm down (though like you mentioned in your post, reinforces my behavior), but also a lot of the time, it sends me into an even worse spiral. it's just an unfortunate conundrum to be a person with HA and no/not good insurance. "
422," i think this is super helpful for someone with health insurance and access to a doctor. i'm inclined to believe that self diagnosis (or at least attempting to do actual research on your symptoms) is sometimes necessary for someone who can't go to the doctor every time they experience a symptom. otherwise, this is a great write up. "
423," i would say that normally, you should ask for permission, but she posted that tattoo design on her instagram story the other night and seemed more than happy for anyone to use it, so i dont think its a crazy assumption to think you could get any of her other doodles.  "
424, wow my 13 year old fan girl dreams are coming true 
425, i had it when they were testing it out in the GSU and id never had ramen so expensive and so mediocre.  
426, Yeah a crazy number like 1800 or something. i ate at the dining hall like less than 20 times last semester though.  
427," these are awesome, but what the hell do you wear them with? i cant imagine trying to style an outfit with shoes this colorful.  "
428, thanks!!! 
429," i work through BU on campus so im not the main person youre asking but i work about 15-20 hours a week and i just schedule my classes around the times i know my job often wants me to work. all of my classes are either before 10am or after 4-5pm. 

its hella hard but i gotta make money so its possible.  "
430, ugh i hate what this sub has become 
431," I cant imagine how frustrating this situation must be for you. I often have days that sound like this due to a couple different mental problems coupled with an overactive hypochondriac brain that seems to create any type of pain i can imagine. And yet I know thats not a fraction of what youre going through. 

Keep remaining strong. I hope like hell you get that service dog soon. If you had the choice, what would you name him/her? "
432, Thanks for the info! Im flying Delta.  
433, Im supposed to be flying into Boston Monday morning. Is it likely there will be issues or is it only for Sunday departures? 
434, man Boston is gonna be hell coming back from highs of like 60 where i am 
435, wouldnt it be we were afraid of my getting pregnant then? the my being before getting rather than before pregnant? 
436," wow this makes me wish i hadnt been a dumb 18 year old and waited to get my No Face tattoo at a better studio than I went to haha

it looks great!! "
437," Yes, youre supposed to have the same professor. Different professors will assign different homework and often go at different paces. If you go to the wrong professors discussion, you will be all off track and any grades work from your discussion will not go towards the right class.  "
438," yes holy shit, i was so worried i was the only one who thought this. jesus, this subreddit is not for this. all of the things people are talking about are terrible and they need to be fixed and helped, but i doubt he enjoys just looking through all of this when its not the point. he cant fix every issue.  "
439, wow you learn something new everyday 
440, i think that the fact that basically nothing comes up when googling blueberry porn or blueberry fetish means i can safely assume this is fake.  
441, wow love the Mucha feeling of this poster!! 
442, ugh yes her Beirut cover is heavenly. man i really need to go back and listen to her Green Day covers again too  
443," honestly this is so fucking obscure, but the little 1 minute long demo of Paper Massacre makes me nearly cry every time i hear it because it just sucks that ill likely never hear the full song. i could easily see it being my favorite with how much i love that snippet. 

also everything from when she was in Ashok.  "
444, wow this also happened to me. it was terrible.  
445," grade deflation, my boi "
446, that is only to view blogs that have been flagged. all of the nsfw content is being slowly purged. theyre only doing that to avoid deleting blogs that may not deserve the flag.  
447, stopped using B N after they repeatedly cancelled my transaction for a book I needed over 4 times over the span of a month and told me over the phone that it just happened sometimes and i ended up having to buy it for hella more money off of amazon. 
448," i guess i understand this if you're talking loudly or talking to someone you can see in person or something, but being in a long distance relationship, i'm so used to pretty regularly calling my SO even if we're out eating alone or something. we're both never louder than anyone else having conversations in person, but we have to talk to each other whenever we have time because of our busy schedules. "
449," i relate to this on a crazy level. i've always been relatively physically healthy and then all of a sudden after a random doctor visit where i was told i had a completely benign heart murmur, i've been losing my mind. every single pain in my body must be related to my heart and i must be about to have a heart attack as a healthy 20 year old. it's exhausting. every time i try to tell myself it's just anxiety, i always think ""what if i'll regret not taking this seriously later"" and then i go into a spiral for hours googling it.  "
450, wow this actually makes a ton of sense now that you've said it. it is right around the holidays which is when we'd be seeing each other again usually. i don't know how i didn't think of that. 
451, lol theres no way money from just working summer jobs equaled extravagance in college. people definitely are still getting help from their parents. i worked through high school after i turned 15 and got a full ride here and i am by no means living extravagantly with that extra money.  
452," because education is ultimately a classist institution and the better and more elite your university, the wealthier everyone is. it is a lot harder for a poor person to go to an elite college because through high school, they probably had to work and not hold education higher than surviving. 

i dont know, this is my two cents as a poor person who honestly has no idea how or why she got here.  "
453," i thought weed was often good for people with anxiety? i've definitely noticed that if i'm extremely anxious, weed exacerbates it, but that if i'm only slightly anxious or not at all, it doesn't bother me. do you actually think weed could be causing the anxiety that i feel while sober? "
454," Lungs without a doubt. when i discovered that album however many years ago that it came out, i seriously only listened to it on repeat for maybe six months. no other music seemed good enough or worth listening to over that album. it is still definitely my favorite album.  "
455," i have had a very similar experience at this school and have begun the process of transferring next school year because of it. shs is incredibly unhelpful and it just seems like they genuinely do not care about me whenever i go in there. 

i would likely not have time if something informal like this was created, but i think it would be useful for students on campus. "
456," at the risk of sounding clueless (i am), all i need is an ethernet cord which i connect my computer to that little box on the wall and my wifi will be better? trying to play online games is a hot mess at the moment for me in myles.  "
457," youve gotten so many comments and im sure you wont see mine and i honestly have nothing else to say anyway besides to extend my thoughts to you. i cannot imagine the immense pain you are going through, but please keep going. what happened was not your fault and i truly believe that one day, you will be able to recover from the intense emotions youre feeling now.  "
458," Yes!!! Im lucky to never have to use this method, but a friend of mine once said to just get on the ground and start seizing and making weird noises. Just look and sound as weird as you possibly can. Nice to see this sort of thing actually worked!! "
459," i literally only shave it all off when i feel like doing it. i honestly try never to do it just because i worry someone might not like it. if im going to sleep with someone and they turn me down in the moment for not being completely bare, then i probably wouldnt want to sleep with them anyway especially if its just a random hook up.  "
460," can't say for sure because i've never gone, but i'm almost certain they check for 21+ id's at the door "
461, how soon did you notice that the effects were getting weaker? 
462," i think it depends. i've definitely had some soc professors that just seemed like they did not care at all about what they were teaching, but i've also had some that were definitely more passionate than any instructor i've ever had. i think it just varies a lot in this major. it's an easy major to not give a shit about, but also super impactful if you care. "
463," yes! a doctor once told me i could have a heart problem, got tested, nothing was wrong, but almost a year later and i still freak out anytime my heartbeat becomes noticeable which just makes it beat faster.  "
464," i do definitely think its the major. ive always had a pretty moderate workload with a sociology major, and this past year, it seems comically low. pre med is just rough, boi.  "
465," ill say what everyone else has already, but its amazing that you were able to show that cat some love and kindness in the last moments of its life.  "
466, yeah its fucking weird. im from atlanta which is a majority black city and i just never noticed how segregated other cities in the US are. BU literally only has a 6% black population which is honestly awful.  
467, honestly i prefer all of the other songs over the main singles.  
468, lol not everyone has parents who can pay their college tuition 
469," BU doesnt feel worth the price tag to me unless you get a pretty hefty scholarship. granted, ive never gone to another university so im not sure what is common as far as resources go, but BU feels pretty average to me. there are some good opportunities because of the school name, but on campus resources seem pretty scarce. 

im hella white passing, but i can tell you that minus asian americans or asian international students, theres not a ton of POC here. depends on where youre coming from, but for me, it was pretty strange going to such a white majority place. never heard of any serious racial issues on campus, but boston itself is super fucking segregated.  "
470, oh my god i thought i was the only one. its so strange. i never knew if there was something wrong with it.  
471," for real? yeah it was super easy for me to change it. maybe it's different in your case, but that's so strange because it was totally not like that for me. "
472, i moved mine twice actually and the second time was the literal day before. 
473," I'm way less worried about my injuries as I know it will be fine given some reasonable time, but it just seems as though this woman may not even be licensed with the mistakes she made and her general lack of knowledge. "
474," damn this sounds awful. shame you didnt get to check out ATL more. itll always be my home, so im biased, but its definitely my favorite city Ive ever been to in the US.  "
475," i didnt know this. my dads information is hers. they are still married and legally she still lives with him, but shes never home and no one ever knows where she is. she keeps all of our legal documents with her to manipulate us to appeasing her so we can do things like file our taxes or i can fill out the fafsa.  "
476, wait so could you theoretically just keep doing one time passes and having someone stay overnight without having to fill out the three day pass (only asking because my roommates are hard to reach to get them to sign it and i live in a single in a suite anyway) 
477," Yeah I definitely understand that. They are very different writers, but something about the topics of the novels feel similar. Especially comparing Wind Up Bird and Slaughterhouse Five. "
478, Slaughterhouse Five is my absolute favorite! 
479," Would highly recommend Vonnegut! He has a similar feeling to his novels, pretty dreamlike and abstract though the tone is more sarcastic than Murakami.  "
480," i know this is not really what you're asking for, but the humidity in my dorm was absolutely terrible too. so much so that even when it got cold, i was still waking up with damp sheets. i got a dehumidifier and it fixed everything. "
481," i don't know what the right thing to do here is. my best friend of 3 years also fell out of love with me and totally blindsided me with the breakup. everything was so absolutely amazing for three years and we had so many future plans together, but he just dropped it out of nowhere. i thought he was joking at first.

it took me a couple months, but i eventually cut contact. he felt terrible about what he did, but he can't control his feelings or lack of feelings. he wanted to stay friends, but i just couldn't. i felt i'd never forgive him for blindsiding me and it was just ruining all of my memories with him to try and salvage something that was gone long before i knew it. "
482," yeah i regularly play games online and every 5-10 minutes, it just completely freezes for a couple seconds. it's really aggravating. "
483, one of my friends who grew up in Russia and regularly visits there says some people actually will go digging through areas they know people hide drugs in to steal them before the actual person gets there.  
484," my best friend and i of like 7 years used to do this in middle school/early high school, but differently. wed sleep facing away from each other and press our butts together and say we could pass our dreams through them. we called it butt dreaming.  "
485, same in Bay State. its either pink or dry.  
486, may have skewed the survey a bit because i dont have contact with my parents so I just had to pick something for the questions about them.  
487," currently living in Boston because of a scholarship to a Boston school, but Ive been super unhappy here for almost two years and finally made the decision to apply to Georgia State as a transfer and be happier back home where I belong!! "
488, i am from atlanta and i went to montreal in late december/early january and it was like -20. there is no explaining how that temperature feels. i honestly dont know how anyone survives there. your tears freeze on your face. and yes i cried because of how painful the cold was. its almost scary.  
489," dude, you obviously know nothing about the war on drugs. no, the literal policy is not to only arrest black people, but rather that there is high policing and surveillance in neighborhoods with a large population of people of color as a result of the policies enacted through the war on drugs. also i mean, look at any statistic about the unequal representation of people of color in prisons.

edit: lol just looked through your profile and you're a piece of work. it's pretty obvious you won't listen to anything I say since you're a literal racist. 
""Leave it to black people to make literally everything about race. Whos the one creating racial tension in USA again?""
nice one considering oh i don't know, the systematic oppression of black people and other people of color is so prevalent in their daily lives and ignored by people like you who have such an incredible privilege that they don't need to think about how they may be killed for the color of their skin everyday and therefore, refuse to accept that any other person may feel that way. btw you should do a better job studying law if you don't know about the policies enacted by the beginning of the war on drugs and the subsequent and continuing voter suppression of people of color to keep said policies in place. "
490, the war on drugs is not backed by policies? the set sentencing of minor drug offenses are not policies and laws? 
491, it stops mattering whether or not cops are good people when the policies and laws they enforce everyday are actively putting minorities in danger and throwing black men in jail for nonviolent drug offenses but you know 
492," Just a warning that all of the therapists SHS recommended me do not have appointments for over a month from now. Sorry i cant give you more specifics on them and obviously you may find someone who does have more availability, but ive had no luck.  "
493," people love to shit on people who dont really enjoy it here, but let me be honest. BU does not cater to poor students regardless of the financial aid they give you. this is probably not an issue for you if you can afford (or your parents can afford) to help you survive here. its hard to do things that are cheap in the city so if you dont have the funds to spend money every weekend, you wont do much after it gets too cold to just explore. 

obviously this is super dependent on your financial situation, but im transferring out next year because BU has not been supportive about my mental health or socioeconomic status.  "
494," i lived in hojo last year and they absolutely worked, but the heat and the AC cant be working at the same time, so it probably isnt working because they turned on the heat a little while ago in most buildings.  "
495, i dont have any money to pay hospital bills. the idea that id have to makes me way more anxious.  
496," it's just past the point of venting being able to help. i don't have contact with my family and i have talked to some close friends, but they just feel helpless. the counselling at my school is literally booked for over 2 months in advance. "
497," i've called hotlines so many times and i always get put on hold because i tell them i don't have plans to kill myself, just a want. they've never said anything reassuring and once a woman undermined my problems. thanks for the advice, but i just don't feel comfortable trying again because it's only made it worse the times i've called. "
498," My SO told me I could call him in the morning last weekend and talk for a couple hours (long distance) and he didnt answer at first and I managed to convince myself that he must have gotten up and gone somewhere and died in a car accident. I called him over 20 times, left voicemails, almost called everyone he knows and it turns out he forgot to turn his ringer on and slept for longer than expected. I had a panic attack for almost two hours trying to imagine life without him and it was nothing. 

So yeah youre definitely not alone.  "
499," A girl loosely involved in my social circle also began posting all of these things on Instagram about how she had discovered what love was and all this stuff about how different numbers meant different things and she would write long strings of them and tell everyone that they just needed to open their eyes and they would understand. She felt like she had discovered true math and felt like prime numbers were speaking to her. This lasted for a couple months, then she disappeared for a while, came back to tell everyone shed be diagnosed with schizophrenia.  "
500," what the hell, either we went to the same school or this is common  "
501," Taking Albums of the 70s and 80s with Barents this semester and would not recommend him. We spend half the class listening to him read from a 30 page packet we also received with writing tips in it. Literally he will sometimes take an hour just reading it word for word and unnecessarily elaborating. He treats the class like a joke, but grades harshly.  "
502," Spent my birthday yesterday night alone, smoking some weed and playing games too!!  "
503, Mears! Shes super great and I would definitely recommend her.  
504, SO100 is really great if youre also into psych. Super easy class with a lot of interesting topics that actually relate to modern day events.  
505," ive always been extremely supportive of the trans community, but i had the same question as OP and always felt that it would be potentially upsetting to people if I asked it, but you cleared it up so nicely for me. thanks for the thoughtful response!! "
506," i know your opinion is obviously unpopular, but i agree with you. its super cringy and seems like some hella weeb shit when people just throw in japanese for the A E S T H E T I C "
507, wow lol i already bought my bus tickets. im fucked.  
508," I cant offer anything since I have had my fair share contacting food banks, but I hope everything gets better for you. That lady was a complete ass and I know how much it sucks to be that low and to have a stranger be so unnecessarily unkind. I really wish the best for you and your family.  "
509," Popular opinion, but Wind Up Bird. Ive read that novel around 5 times and I just always find something else to love about it. Anyone who meets me and is familiar with it says I must have sucked up May Kasaharas personality when I first read it haha "
510, no choir is literally the best song on the album...cant believe its in the bottom. its such a lungs era song and makes me cry every time.  
511," im not sure this is helpful, but i showed up for GA in boston about half an hour before doors opened and i was able to squeeze into a spot front and center against the barricade.  "
512, What is this discord? I'd love to join! 
513," yeah my mother was very violent towards my father. i have a lot of dreams that shes trying to kill me in a car accident by driving purposefully with me while on drugs. though she never intended to hurt me, she did drive me and my brother around as kids a lot while on heroin and she would nod off while driving often. it makes sense why i have those dreams honestly.  "
514," yes i have dreams all the time that my mother is trying to kill me (she was never physically violent towards me though). its weird because i havent spoken to her in almost 2 years, but the nightmares have become a pretty common thing.  "
515," i know you said most, but im just thinking about how i know three separate people who got thrown in jail in three separate states for having a literally joint butt in their car.  "
516," sorry i cant help out, but i was wondering if the concert merch is cash only? was it at your show or did they also take card? "
517, well i didnt know and thats why i asked 
518, I'm going to be wearing a dress or else I would... 
519, oh gross 
520," dude kudos to you for doing this. if i was in toronto, id take this in a heartbeat. i hope it goes to someone who deserves it!! "
521, English changes over time and adds new slang. this shouldnt be shocking. hello came before hey.  
522, wow what a beautiful story to read first thing in the morning. its wonderful that everything worked out for you.  
523, lol you wanna buy me another jacket then 
524, lol i was wearing a jean jacket today 
525, holy fuck that is so much earlier than i was expecting. 
526," i've never heard anyone else express this. i feel like i only understand love in a romantic context. it feels unusual to tell my family or friends that i love them. it just feels like something you don't say unless you're ""in love"" with a partner "
527," i just want to say ive been also going through this almost exact situation for the past week and though i dont want to cry by typing out all the details, im glad you shared this. it made today a little easier.  "
528," yes!! its definitely because of the whole myles renovation. i lived in hojo last year and marciano was never that crowded even at peak hours. now though, its crazy almost all the time.  "
529," dude an apology isnt enough for you? damn if you wanna get all riled up over this, be my guest.  "
530, BU ended up being cheaper for me with scholarships than anywhere else so i can't really transfer unfortunately :/  
531," i don't really have any great input or advice, but i feel for you. i'm only a 2nd year now, but i'm also really looking forward to studying abroad my senior year since i also really hate boston. i can't imagine how awful i'd feel if i got rejected. i hope the best for you 3 "
532, there are also music rooms with pianos in myles.  
533, bro you dont have to plan things now. every year i just ignore the planner until a couple weeks before we need to choose classes. its not that deep.  
534, where is this womb room??  
535, just because im familiar with it doesnt make it okay. im not surprised at all. 
536, gotta love that blatant segregation in such a liberal city 
537," definitely not a fan of the new menu. i like the vibe of the place now, but i miss the crepes and the fact that the whole thing feels like its masquerading as a hip bougie vegan restaurant feels wrong.  "
538," yeah other than this problem, i love it! i have a dehumidifier on the way so hopefully it helps! "
539," i live in myles and i just use a floor lamp to light the room because its nicer than those shitty super bright ceiling lights. the only thing that sucks is if the room is dark while im in bed, every time i move, the sensor lights up with this annoying green light. its even woken me up because i rolled over and it lit up. i am thinking of just hanging something over it since i dont use the ceiling lights anyway. 

and ive never had that problem in my bathroom. i didnt even know the bathroom lights were on a sensor. i thought it was just timed. id call facilities and ask.  "
540," i own Hard Boiled Wonderland and have stopped and started it so many times. i just cant seem to get past the first couple of chapters. for some reason, i just lose interest. did this happen to you at all? i really want to enjoy it.  "
541, dude this is a great list. i think i may definitely pick this one.  
542," This looks absolutely great. I was on the hunt for something less than 15"" since my school bag barely fits my current laptop which is the same size as the one you listed, but honestly, this laptop seems worth it for the price. Thank you!! "
543," I would say do whatever you want. If you want to go home and you dont mind the travel time compared to the actual time youll spend there that weekend, do it. If i was two hours away, Id definitely go back way more often.  "
544, just wanted to say that reading your comment really made this fellow poor kid feel a lot less alone.  
545," dude i feel this. i dont have much advice, but it has been so fucking hard to go to BU coming from extreme poverty. it feels like no one gets it. i once had a girl tell me she couldnt believe i had time for a job for fun and i couldnt even comprehend that. i have a job because i need to eat. 

it has helped me a lot knowing there are others like me so i thought id say that as a fellow poor person, i totally get you. it sucks so much. its really isolating going here.  "
546, theres nothing to fix. its just how the meal swipes convert into dining points. itll likely always be this way because its not a trick or anything.  
547," not gonna lie, im a huge fan of this bedroom and the print. everyone saying its not tasteful is really oversexualizing it and taking it way too seriously. its art. and its great.  "
548," the fact that i have to move back to boston in less than a week to do my sophomore year of college. i hate boston and its harsh winters and im only in college because of a full ride that im very grateful for, but that i shouldnt have taken for my mental health. i am leaving behind so many amazing people in my hometown and im tired of living as two different people in two different places.  "
549, his comment history is pretty disturbing too. lots of stuff about pedophilia and rape.  
550," i love smoking with close friends, but no one will ever be a better smoking partner than myself. i find that if i ever do get anxious or paranoid from smoking, its always because im just hyperaware of how i must look to everyone else so i never get super high with friends. by myself though, i can get obliterated and enjoy every minute of it because it doesnt matter how i look.  "
551, wow i didnt even think of this and it just made it a whole other level of fucked up 
552," i'm just not sure how to soak the inside of it because i don't want the iso to get into the device. i've been able to soak all of the other parts to pretty much perfectly clean, but it's just the chamber that seems super fucking gross still.

edit: forgot to say that i soak the other pieces in iso overnight and then clean with a q-tip. for the inner chamber, i just soak a q-tip in iso, flip it upside down and swirl it around and then follow up with the little cleaning tool they provide along with the vape. "
553," just piggybacking off of everyone else, i smoked almost every single night anywhere along the charles. no one ever said anything or cared and most of the other people there at least at night are also smoking.  "
554, bruh i would not fuck with warren. thats probably the worst place to try to smoke.  
555, hey thanks so much for this detailed reply. ill look more into the setup of my room.  
556," i actually found a stray kitten outside my house yesterday and was able to find a friend who wanted to take her. unfortunately she lived 45 minutes away and i had absolutely no supplies to transport a kitten, so i just shoved her in a cardboard box, poked some holes, and put some big books on top so she couldnt get out. 

she growled and hissed the whole ride until she somehow managed to claw one of the air holes big enough to stick her head through. here i am, driving down the interstate, and she finally gets out. as soon as shes out of the box, she calms down and just falls asleep on the passenger seat. it was so adorable and made me think i should have forgone all the stress and just sat her in my car to begin with.  "
557," got pulled into a brownstone triple with a 29k number and got summer swapped into a single in myles about a month ago. 

i didnt have to contact housing or anything so i think i just got really lucky. hope everything works out for you. shitty housing is the worst.  "
558," nope, i am from atlanta and i either have to suck it up and stay in boston for breaks or shell out the money to fly home.  "
559," oh wow hi me too!!

i read this and was like wait they have sweet hut in other places??? "
560, bro this is wild good luck lol 
561," i cant give you numbers like these others can, but i lived in Hojo last year and the wifi seemed pretty good. every week or so, it would just sort of randomly go out and youd have to disconnect and reconnect, but other than that, it seemed fine.  "
562," If you think that waiting a month would ruin your relationship, I honestly dont think the relationship is really worth it. There are people here who went years before meeting their SOs or just wait years between visits.  "
563," hey thanks, i appreciate it. happy cake day by the way!! "
564," i know!! we both arent believers in things like fate and such, but we always say meeting each other is the best proof we have for it! "
565, i also met my SO through reddit!! he was clicking the random subreddit button and stumbled across a sub i had just posted in so i was at the top. he made an account just to message me and here we are 3 years later! 
566, please do not listen to this idiot and have unprotected sex with two girls for your first time.  
567, i will never forget the scene in spirited away where chihiro cries these tears while eating a dumpling that haku gives her. it makes me cry every single time i watch it.  
568, yeah i get you. i only knew about the weight limit because i saw someone else have that problem when i was picking up boxes. its honestly ridiculous how expensive it is regardless when i could really just get a storage unit for like $50 a month if i only had a car.  
569," its really not that bad. its a bit more expensive than storing off campus, but if you factor in renting a uhaul, then its about the same price either way. 

its much more cost efficient to just get a bunch of their small boxes rather than try to pack everything into bigger ones.  "
570," wow this gives me so much hope. my so and i have been doing long distance for two years and its not going to end any time in the foreseeable future. i love him so much and were willing to wait however long, but sometimes it seems like the odds are all stacked against us.  "
571," there are specific family related sociology courses, but i havent taken any yet!

ive taken an intro level sociology class, one specifically about race and ethnicity, and one about gender and sexuality.  "
572," i felt the same. in my first three years of high school, i passed every math class without trying and was set on going into university for it. my senior year calc class kicked my ass, but i also had a shit teacher so i blames it on that. 

first week of freshman year in college, i was the only one in a class of over 100 to fail a calculus review quiz. decided to switch majors immediately.  "
573, i actually wanted to be a math major haha. i was such a goddamn fool 
574," i like it a lot so far! ive had some pretty good professors. im only a first year so im not sure how great the research opportunities are. 

bu itself is another story, but the sociology department is really great.  "
575," got accepted as a math major, but switched to sociology

and yeah the new one out of 1600 "
576, yeah no worries. i graduated with a 3.75 and next to no AP classes. i made a 1310 on the sat and a 28 on the act.  
577," yeah dude, like everyone else has said, it depends. my gpa, sat scores, and act scores are below the average, but i had a really good personal essay and lots of outside job experience.  "
578," this is a total shot in the dark, but is this place in atlanta? i have a feeling its an old tea shop i worked at years ago. the little wooden dish and fork looks like the ones we had. they used to make little desserts like this often.  "
579, maybe? 
580," im from georgia and every year when the watermelon flavor would come out in the summer, id want to try it, but i had no idea if it would be good. i mean, what does a watermelon milkshake taste like????

now im no longer in a cook out state and i regret not trying it everyday.  "
581," wow i've never heard of anyone else having this

i am extremely extroverted and it turns my whole week around to have a plan to look forward to even if it's just something small. being cancelled on just throws me to the deepest pits of hell basically. even if it's not the other person's fault or it's just postponed. i cannot handle it in the slightest. it feels like the world is ending because i feel like ""damn it, this is what was getting me through the week"" "
582," Haha, I actually have the highest upvoted comment on your old post. It helped me a lot to read that so many people have similar issues.

I wish you a lot of luck in transferring. I'm trying to figure that out right now. "
583," Yeah, I get that. I guess I'm just wondering when I'll start to find people who I feel close to and who care about me. "
584," I've never had an issue with it before. It's not like I'm some person with a lack of social skills. 

It doesn't seem like it's ever my fault or their fault. It's just always that we're super different people with no unifying thing to talk about. "
585," I don't really enjoy sports.

I don't like that though. I've never had friends I would describe as people I see a lot, but don't hate. My friends back home are people I deeply love who care about me and who I have meaningful conversations with. If that's your definition of friends, I have hundreds of those and I still feel lonely. "
586," Yeah, I went to one where we just walked around Middlesex Fells and that one was okay. I talked to a lot of people, but no one ever contacted me afterwards.

That one has really been the only cheap one though. Most of them are at least over $30. "
587," Even if I don't feel the conversation goes anywhere initially, I keep talking to people always just because I'm honestly so desperate for a connection. It's quite obvious though. It's usually a super stunted conversation where no actual back and forth communication is happening because every time one of us grasps at straws trying to find some common ground, it just never happens. I've had more awkward conversations here than anywhere in my entire life. "
588," I guess I'm looking to find people who are interested in hanging out outdoors (I joined the outdoors club, but the trips are too expensive for me to go on usually), going to concerts with me (I haven't found anyone here who wants to go to the same ones), and just people to talk to and feel close to.

It's more so just that I can't connect with anyone for some reason. I guess I need some things in common to start that relationship, but it never goes further than talking occasionally. "
589," I am having a hard time meeting people who are interested in the same things that I am. Anything from like hobbies to music, etc. It's hard to form a close relationship to someone if it never really seems like you both have anything to talk about. It feels like most of my conversations with people fall flat just because we don't have much in common.  "
590," The scene in Spirited Away where Haku takes Chihiro to see her parents as pigs for the first time since they got turned into them and theyre sitting in that really beautiful garden when he gives her a dumpling and tell her to eat it. And she hesitates and then starts shoving it in her mouth and she begins crying. It gets more and more emotional and desperate until shes sobbing and shoveling it into her mouth. 

Theres just something about the emotion in that scene that makes sense to me. I always cry a little when I see it because its just the first time you see her really break under all the pressure.  "
591," its super easy to switch. whenever you meet with your advisor to schedule classes over the summer, just tell them you actually want to do CS and they can just change it right there. 

source: changed colleges and majors three times before second week of freshman year "
592," what????? summer is for smoking weed, my dude.  "
593," my semester was a rollercoaster honestly. i liked my classes, but still considering transferring/dropping out because im not sure BU is really for me regardless of all the opportunities ive had. ive got four finals, but im not too worried about them even though i should be. 

ive given up alcohol after some particularly awful hangovers, but my weed dependence is through the roof. never knew i could smoke multiple times a day and still want more haha "
594, no 
595," i agree with the previous comment. my schedule next semester is thankfully akin to being a com major, but i did everything i could to pack all of my classes into tues-thurs even if it meant that i went hard those three days. 

a four day weekend in exchange for three (or just one in your case) hard days? totally worth it.  "
596," let me reiterate 

i aint got no friends, son "
597, It is the same professor. Should I email him and ask or should I just go to the section I need to and let whoever is teaching the discussion know? 
598," i ain't got no friends, son "
599," i completely forgot about this line, but i can hear it so clearly in my head "
600, i do this very often. sometimes i get to the point where it's hard to convince myself it hasn't actually happened. i try a lot not to think like this because i feel like i put myself through the panic and fear and sorrow every time i think about it. my chest will literally start to hurt so bad that even that alone is enough to make me sob.  
601," MA109/CS109

theyre both the same class "
602," 109 is absolutely a joke. its terribly boring, but you really dont have to know anything for that class. literally questions on the test were like if a town has a 20% chance of getting hit with a hurricane annually and it gets hit two years in a row, what is the chance for the next year?

like its kind of ridiculous how that class exists

so take it. its great for getting your math out of the way.  "
603, ooh thanks! browser based seems the easy way to go with shit computers.  
604, not everyone has good parents. im sure she knows her situation better than anyone else.  
605," as most people have said, it will show up on the insurance. i also do not recommend telling them if it will make your situation worse. i cant believe people in this thread dont get that. not everyone has parents like them. 

just call shs and explain it to them. they will be able to work with you and give you better answers than anyone here can. and your parents have no way of knowing that you called them. 

good luck by the way. i know how much of a bitch it is to get help with less than ideal parents.  "
606," wow this is some next level shit. i really feel you. i dont know if id say i necessarily identify as a primal sub, but this really explains a lot of my interest in kink. i even saved this so i could show my boyfriend. i really appreciate this writing.   "
607," yes! i just went off to university this past year and i felt like such an idiot because everyone around me is so set on their future career and thats what they sink their time into. 

im happy doing just about any job so long as its not too draining or stressful just so that i can make money to have meaningful experiences outside of my job. i couldnt care less about what i actually do for work.  "
608," what makes you think im getting a film degree??? im literally a first year student taking general education requirements. this is for an english class im required to take. 

you should probably stop acting like you know who i am and what i need. i am on the path to making my life easier. i didnt expect to post here asking a simple question and get all these fucking assumptions god damn "
609," really, thanks a lot. i know shit like this shouldn't get to me, but i was having a pretty hard day already and it's really nice to have someone help me out.  "
610, ah thank you this looks really good 
611, i love your edit to this calling me an entitled emerson kid. i dont go to emerson and im literally supporting myself and barely eating. read my post history you fucking asshole.  
612," okay dude this is for a fucking small ass two minute video. you could have just not responded. i wasnt looking for a location scout. im literally filming it on a phone. 

i already said i looked and i used my budget this week looking. thought it would be easier if anyone had something in mind. hope it made you feel better to berate me for asking a question.  "
613, you dont even know where i live. youre saying everywhere in the city youre thinking of would be walking distance from absolutely any place i could be living? 
614," wow okay thanks. i just moved here and the assignment isnt to find a place. i already had my own vision, i was just looking for somewhere to make that happen. i was assuming people had suggestions. im too broke to be paying for public transit around the city aimlessly. sorry my question was so offensive to you "
615, thanks so much 
616, thank you for this. ill check it out.  
617, damn why is everyone in boston such an asshole 
618, im asking where something like that would be. ideally a pedestrian tunnel or something. i dont want cars in the shot.  
619," wow thanks, super helpful  "
620," im sure he does when i leave, but no, hes not allowed to touch himself while im there.  "
621, where? i don't see anything that lists the summer swap application. 
622, this just takes me to a page that asks me to login and then takes me to the home page of the housing portal? 
623," i agree with this wholeheartedly. maybe this is because i come from a majority black city, but i swear i see a non-white/asian person once every other week. BU is only 6% black. it's a huge problem and is discussed at length in pretty much every af-am studies class. if you think BU is diverse, than you obviously grew up in a very white area. "
624, its not depression that causes them. its whatever illness i have. you cant just retrain your brain to not possibly have schizophrenia.  
625," my boyfriend has actually been trying to get me to read this book forever. i will soon. 

its too late to tell me to not date. i dont think its been bad for me. hes known me for four years and has seen what ive gone through and been there in it with me. he may be the only thing that feels positive in my life at the moment. he tries to keep me on track.  "
626," okay yes, i agree to an extent about this. but i have a severe undiagnosed mental illness that causes extreme and vivid hallucinations usually multiple times a day. positive thinking cannot get me past that.  "
627," i would honestly love that so much, but i really dont have the time to realistically care for an animal. i do think it would help me a lot though.  "
628," i havent found that walking helps. being with animals helps, but i dont have anywhere i can just go whenever im feeling upset. really physical touch helps me more than anything. physical feelings are the only sense i dont hallucinate so it makes me feel safe. really just being close to someone or something helps a lot. 

and yeah, id like if you could send me those ideas on how to soothe myself. i try so many different things and it would be nice to find one that doesnt involve someone else for when im alone.  "
629," im not sure honestly. its really hard for me to feel better when im sad. i usually just sleep or cry/freak out until it goes away which is like an hour or more. i also have a boyfriend who it helps to talk to, but were long distance so most of the time he cant actually hold me. 

being held has consistently been one of the only things that calms me down.  "
630, i went to 22 different low income therapists. they all did not have the capabilities to treat me and referred me to outside specialists  
631," i have done some research, but i havent turned up very much. ive also had bad experiences with cheap therapy when i was in my hometown and i doubt itll be any different here.  "
632," its cold right now, but its not terrible at the moment. id just suggest wear lots of layers. im from georgia so it was a huge shock coming here. you probably dont own a good coat so wear a long sleeve shirt with a sweater on top and the heaviest coat you own. 

its not even below freezing here but itll probably feel hella cold for you so its better to just overdo it. 

i cant recommend any restaurants really because i havent been here for very long but im sure someone else can! "
633," thank you for this. 

i forgot to mention some things in this post as i'm sure i would. i am currently in therapy through my university, however, they have not been much help because they aren't trained to deal with my kind of mental illnesses. they have referred me to several outside psychologists, but i can't afford the copay even with my insurance.

i also have reached out to other students just in an attempt to make friends, but it hasn't helped. i have two people who i see occasionally, but i still feel like i don't connect with them because of our drastically different upbringings. "
634," no worries, i understand.

yes, i have looked around, but i haven't found much. before i left for university, i was in a low income therapy program and it didn't help at all. the therapists were untrained and i felt like they were discounting all of my issues.

i haven't considered getting a student loan because i'm just really scared i'll be poor my whole life and i really don't want that. "
635," i answered this earlier, but basically i am in therapy at my university, but they have told me that they can't really do much besides be there to listen because they don't have training in severe mental illnesses. they have referred me repeatedly to an outside psychologist, but the copay even with my insurance is still too expensive for me. "
636," i just can't keep hanging in there. i've been doing that for my whole life. this was supposed to be when things got better. i rested my whole future on getting out of my parents' house and then i did and everything in me stayed the same. this wasn't how it was supposed to be.
 "
637," thanks for the response. 

i actually am doing some therapy through my college at the moment, but it hasn't really helped because none of them have experience dealing with severe psychosis. they have been referring me to an outside psychologist, but the copay is too expensive for me. "
638, I hate it here and can't leave because it's the cheapest option for me by a land slide and it would be stupid to give it up. 
639," um we know that because of history. there were no trials for black people because they were considered people. there is no racial bias at play.

how is this not common knowledge?  "
640, woah with actual security?? it was always completely deserted when i was went.  
641," ah okay yeah, there was never a fence before. there was just an entrance off key road. i went once when there was a huge dirt mound piled there to discourage dumping, but never a fence.  "
642," i heard that it got fenced in this summer and that security cameras were installed after the fire. thats why i am asking. 

i definitely know the immediate risk of going, but ive gone many times and its been fine. my question is whether its still accessible. have you been recently? "
643," the page that says that has said that for years, but ive still visited at least ten times with no issue. what i want to know is if its fenced in now or something? "
644, you dont think any singles will open up even in warren? or no one in warren would want to switch? 
645, isnt that considered a good number for summer swap since it goes backwards? 
646, ah me and my SO are also Georgia to Canada!! 
647," not that great. im in one currently. the beds half to stay lofted unless you want one down. 

my roommate and i have ours down since our other roommate never sleeps in the room and its a weird setup we have. she has to use her bed as her desk chair to be able to fit everything and our dressers literally face each other so we can only use them one at a time. 

if you keep all the beds lofted, its not awful space wise, but the room feels cramped because you cant see any of the walls.  "
648," oh wow, its cumsum "
649," Yeah, same actually. i also got into a brownstone triple with her, which is kinda shitty, but oh well.  "
650, would i go through the office of disabilities for this? do you know? 
651, shes not leaving my roommate group because she wants to. its just because she realistically cant help me at this point because there are only single spaces left in most of the myles suites 
652," my roommate has a 17,000 number and its looking like it wont happen for either of us so its unlikely "
653," I feel like I'd like BU if I wasn't hella poor. I commented in the other thread posted about this recently with a much more detailed answer, but damn, I feel like I'm reminded everyday how fucking poor I am. It's not that I don't get along with wealthy people, but it just sucks literally not having anyone understand the extent to which money was scarce growing up and still is. It's hard not to feel alone when a lot of my personality and interests come from having to experience struggles that no one here seems to have any idea about. "
654," So we actually havent gotten to Murakami yet. I think thats sometime in the next couple of weeks. I cant really answer this question because of that, but I know my professor is a huge Murakami fan and thinks he very much embodies the essence of a lot of Japanese literature.  "
655," I am currently in a Modern Japanese Literature class at Boston University and we read Wind Up Bird. Next semester, there is an entire class dedicated to Murakamis works that Im also hoping to take. 

So yes, Id say hes appreciated.  "
656," piggybacking off of everyone else, BU is totally not worth it. im only here because its the cheapest option for me, but i have friends going to state schools that enjoy their schools as much as people here like BU and have similar opportunities.  "
657, you have to keep that stuff in the room so my roommate and i just shoved it under our beds. theres surprisingly not much stuff.  
658," My friends and I are planning to live there next year and were all really excited. i havent personally seen the inside, but one of my friends sent me photos of the rooms and theyre really nice. Looking forward to having a single room! "
659," Yes, you can definitely unloft both beds in a double. Im in a triple right now and two of us have unlofted beds and its a bit tight, but it works. Ive seen multiple doubles in Hojo as well and every one Ive seen had both beds unlofted.  "
660," I may do it, but Im not quite sure yet! "
661," just wanted to chime in and say it gets so much easier after the first week or so. 

the first time i met my SO, leaving him was the absolute hardest thing ive ever done. i felt like wed had an experience so magical and perfect that i couldnt even talk about it. it felt pointless. life started to feel pointless because i had just experienced happiness i didnt know existed...and then it was gone, indefinitely. 

but things got better over time! skyping became more normal and even though our second visit was almost a year after our first, counting down the days made it easier. it will get easier as time goes on. you will remember how you lived before he came to visit you.  "
662," 99% sure that was me. Someone was kind enough to give me their used winter coat because i was too poor to buy one. The cold doesnt hurt as much, but it still fucking sucks and my hands almost fall off everyday.  "
663," hey, i had this problem for my whole life until last year because i got on birth control and just couldnt spend time every morning trying to get them down without gagging. 

i cant promise this will work for you, but i just started carrying a box of tic tacs with me wherever i went and kept trying to swallow them. something about them not being pills eased my mind and allowed me to do it after a couple of days. 

also try putting the pill (or tic tac) on your tongue and taking a full water bottle, put your whole mouth around the opening and tip your head back. just keep aggressively swallowing the water and it usually gets down. since ive gotten over my fear, i can take pills without any water usually now.  "
664, im seconding this 
665," Yes, I second this. The only time Ive ever come close to a marathon like that is every time Ive visited my long distance boyfriend. The first visit was insane, but we still see each other only once every few months so its still pretty ridiculous.  "
666," Hopefully in mid April for our two year anniversary, but its still up in the air  "
667," If I dont wanna go all the way to esplanade, sometimes I do it behind hojo, but its a little sketch "
668," Its so crazy to read your experience and the other comments here because I feel like Im the only one who hates it here. I only came here because it ended up being my cheapest option with the financial aid given to me, but I am seriously considering going back to my home state to go to college even though it will be more expensive and less quality. 

I cant meet fucking anyone here. I have two people who I occasionally talk to, but they have their own main groups. I will sometimes get invited to hang out with them, but its always a bit obvious that Im an outsider and that they all hang out without me much more. I have a work study job, but they cant really give me more hours and Im struggling so hard with money that I literally have next to no way to pay for food outside of the dining hall or even the T to get to anywhere off campus. I cant find a single off campus job who will take the hours I can offer and everything just sucks here. 

Im trying to stick it out since its so cheap for me to attend this school, but Im so depressed here. SHS cant help me without referring me to an outside therapist which would cost $10 a week (money I dont have) and Im so ready to just give up and drop out all together. 

Anyway, I guess this is just me also ranting and letting you know that you arent alone. The fact that Im not after reading this gave me some solace considering I feel like everywhere I go is one big circle jerk about how amazing this place is.  "
669," So I did not have quite the same experience, but something sort of familiar. I came out as 100% total gay when I was 11 years old. I was so sure Id never like men and I stayed that way pretty much throughout the entirety of my high school years. Its a bit different for me though because I did have sexual interactions with men still, but it was just experimental and I didnt enjoy any of them much. I never could have felt real attraction and real emotion towards a man. 

And then I met my current SO/dom/whatever you wanna call him, and everything changed. Even though Id slept with men in the past, it was always boring and I still identified as entirely gay. Hell, I still do kind of because hes literally the only man I think Ill ever really want. I was so confused at first because the attraction to him was the same Id felt towards women my whole life. Our kinks meshed perfectly and we had a connection that really came the minute we first met. 

Anyway, that was unnecessarily long, but I just wanted to say that Id definitely had this experience. Dont worry about labeling yourself if its confusing for you. Just do what you want. Why not go for this? "
670," The earlier you submit your FAFSA, the more financial aid there is available to give you. I submitted that shit the day it opened in like October.  "
671, Wow this is so sexist.  
672, Literally boarding a plane out of Boston into Toronto right now. Wishing you all a great life as I prepare to die.  
673, I am also only one day away from seeing my SO!! 
674," I also dream about my ex every night and she left me in June 2017...so like 8 months ago. I even have an SO currently who loves me so much more than she did and I am so much happier with him, but I still, without fail, dream about her every night. Just normal things, like hanging out with her and stuff.  "
675," Wow, you are so beautiful! Congrats on getting the gig  "
676," I love Hojo as a current freshman, but its not social. No one really uses the common areas and I have had to make quite an effort to talk to people. The private bathrooms and control of AC is great, but I would recommend it if you already arent very social.  "
677," But if youre not enjoying his rules, then why are you doing them? Yes he is your dom, but whats the point in having rules if theyre making you uncomfortable. Its okay for your dom to push you, but if something is something you actively dislike, you shouldnt do it. 

This is like rule #1 for power dynamic relationships.  "
678," Uhh, why dont you just tell him you dont like it? "
679, Ah that was me who made the GroupMe! Glad to see its gonna be remade because it didnt last very long.  
680," Fuck, if only I still lived in Atlanta, Id be there! "
681," Yes go to the financial aid office! They looked at my income and my amount of financial aid and completely waived the fee for me. I cant promise anything, but it could work.  "
682," I totally understand this. I am basically wrecked for a week after I see my SO. its important to remember that it will go back to normal. Suddenly its been a month since youve seen them and youre already planning the next visit and everything is okay. 

Its gonna be hard though for a while. After I met him the first time, we could barely talk on Skype because Id just start crying. Just keep living day by day and in a week or so, itll start getting easier.  "
683," Damn man Im always looking too. I play with a couple friends every weekend, but I want to meet new people and actually play with a club.  "
684," I just joined this semester and I havent gone to a single outing yet because the one for this past weekend got cancelled because of the rain...so I cant really tell you. 

But when I went to the interest meeting, there were literally 200 people there and they talked about how big the trips are so I feel like its probably fine to go if you dont know anyone.  "
685," Would totally recommend the outing club if youre at all into nature. You can just go to their website and sign up for the email list. There are weekly meetings, but you dont have to go to any. You can just wait until theres an outing you want to go to and go to it.  "
686," Yes! Female here and I have dated one woman, but have had many flings with men even though I consider myself mostly gay. I just cannot find women who are interested in hooking up or having anything more. I feel like its pretty easy for me to find men who are interested in me, but theres really only been one girl ever.  "
687," This is incredible. My boyfriend and I have only been together for about two years and sometimes its so disheartening to know that we wont be able to close the distance any time in the near future because we are in such different places in our lives. 

But this post gives me hope. Its amazing to hear that, against the odds, you both have made it work. Im excited for you guys to close the distance! "
688, I dont have a Mac and my laptop is wayyyyy too shitty to handle Skyrim ever. Thanks for the suggestion though  
689, Haha yeah it is! Best intro to a novel Ive ever read.  
690," So this is a pretty weird post that will likely get no responses, but ever since I got back from winter break, I have had Skyrim on the brain. I probably racked up months worth of gameplay in middle school on it and I really wanna relive the magic. 

So the problem is that I dont have a console or PC to play it on and neither do any of my friends...would anyone at all be willing to make friends with a girl who is absolutely dying to play it again? I promise Im cool and I need more friends anyway.  "
691," Im always in these threads recommending Hojo, so let me give it another go!

Its right in front of Towers on Com Ave and its air conditioned with private bathrooms. Its about an equal mix of freshman and sophomores and though most of the rooms are triples, its not too hard to snag a double if youre lucky. Its super close to most classes too!

Its a quiet dorm though, I wont lie. People on your floor dont form cliques and theres no real common areas that people hang out in. That being said, its just a five minute walk from Warren so I found myself just walking over to there to hang out with friends which was so worth it for the temp control and my own bathroom. Its really a hidden gem and though the building is old and ugly, its not bad at all. There arent many issues with it in my experience and Ive enjoyed living here more than I ever would in a place where the whole floor shared the bathroom. Its nice to be able to shower in a place that doesnt regularly have puke in the sink.  "
692," We only ever message through Skype, but honestly Id feel better if I could see that it was read, but not responded to. I rarely ever worry that he hates me. I just always think hes dead haha "
693," I thought I was the only fucking one. 

My boyfriend and I are long distance and Im not super connected to anyone in his life so when he doesnt respond for a while, I immediately think holy shit hes dead and I wont have any way of knowing

Gives me crazy anxiety until he finally messaged "
694," I just want a break. I want three days to not think about anything and just do whatever I want with no priorities. I havent slept more than an hour for the past two nights, I may have diabetes, and Ive got two essays due by midnight that I cannot bare to start. Life is really bad and I just need a break.  "
695, Yeah damn I was thinking that too. I feel like I message my boyfriend a ridiculous amount and that ends up being like 30-40 times a day. I cant imagine doing more than that.  
696," Im in a triple in Hojo currently, but Ive seen a double before. Theyre only a bit smaller than a triple honestly and I think its totally worth it for a private bathroom and control of the temperature. Its pretty hard to get a double though because they only exist on the second floor.  "
697," Just dropping in to confirm what many others have said with my relationship story!

My partner and I have been together for almost 2 years and were long distance so we see each other maybe once every three months or so for a few days. Were hella kinky and hes just usually so excited to be rough with me and fuck me as hard as he can. Its great, I love it. 

But literally just in the last month, did I finally feel comfortable to ask him to make love to me (not his fault I didnt feel comfortable, just me) and even though it was new to us and took me explaining to him exactly what I wanted, it was incredible. Honestly rough kinky sex has become our norm that it almost feels more exciting to just have vanilla sex now. 

Id say definitely just bring it up!! If your partner cares for you, Im sure hed try it at least. Theres always a compromise especially if you just want variety occasionally.  "
698," No advice to give, but Im over here states away hurting for you. Stay strong. You did nothing at all to deserve this. You have so many people on here thinking of you and supporting you.  "
699," One of my roommates is a sophomore this year and did random selection so I don't think it's too uncommon!

That being said, I've heard it's quite difficult to snag a single during sophomore year, so it's likely that your friends will end up having to room with someone. "
700," I think it super depends. I didnt have great grades (maybe like a little higher than the average high school student), but my family makes less than $10k a year so I only paid about $1,000 to go here this year. So technically, BU was cheaper than a community college for me.  "
701, You literally just said international students arent the same as normal people. Thats literally the definition of racism: thinking that you are superior to someone because of their race. I hope your roommate gets a room change because you sound terrible.  
702," My boyfriend and I are in an open relationship and have been since the beginning. We both had never been in closed relationships so it was just sort of assumed that we would be open. 

Our rules are different together than they are apart. No romantic attraction, just sex with other people. Were also pretty relax about details. We like talking about our sex lives so it just sort of naturally comes up in conversation.  "
703, Im mailing him one of my favorite books that Ive been meaning to send him forever along with his favorite Lindt chocolates! 
704," Yes I absolutely have that. Or random, very normal things will remind me of him. Sometimes Im brushing my teeth and I remember standing next to him in the morning and doing that same thing and it just forces me to tears. Or anything really. Driving in my car after hes been in it, taking a bath and remember when we took them together. 

And yes, I always found it so soothing to know Im not alone. For some reason, the it gets better thing never makes me feel better unless its from this sub because I just know people get it.  "
705," I understand this. I'm literally sitting in the airport after my 6th visit with him and it never seems to get easier. I've cried for 3 hours straight now and anytime I think about him, it just gets worse. I want to press my sweater to my nose that still smells like him, but damn, it just breaks me.

It gets better. That's such a shitty answer, but you just have to make it through this week and it'll get better eventually. It always does. That's what I've learned. I can cry for literally 24 hours straight after leaving him, but I have to hold on to the fact that it'll get easier again. We will begin planning our next visit and my skype calls to him won't ever feel like enough, but they will feel normal. "
706," I know you didnt mention this as a choice, but Hojo (575 Commonwealth) has been the best dorm for me my first year!!

I met tons of people on my floor and I share a bathroom with only two other people. I like that the floors are separated by gender and not to mention that I control the temperature of my room (including AC when its hot!)

Seriously, this dorm is the best.  "
707, I've never heard the theory about Silent Hill being entirely about circumcision...can you link me to an explanation because I'm super curious? 
708, I actually am in Atlanta for the holidays so Ive been sitting in 50-60 degree weather most days.  
709," Im also a first year sociology student and honestly, so far, the only professor Ive had for sociology was kinda awful and acted like she didnt even really know what she was talking about. But its an easy and interesting major and youll easily have time for a minor.  "
710," Damn, this sounds like such a hard situation. I would agree with what others have said and dont give up on strap ons. Ive seen some that literally feel like the real thing minus the warmth. 

Give each other time. I think its great that youre doing what you can for him and figuring out ways to still enjoy your sex life to an extent. I know this isnt for everyone, but maybe in the future, you guys could try an open relationship? Dont push that if it doesnt feel right, but I think it could be helpful for you two if it does work out. 

Good luck to you both.  "
711," Ive only been here for one semester to be fair, but I have a few Chinese American friends and acquaintances here and Ive never heard of any of them getting bullied at all. The Asian population at BU is huge so I doubt youd get bullied for having Asian eyes.  "
712," Yes!! 

To be fair though, I was a total idiot about it. I made a post on this subreddit and some girl messaged saying she was interested in hanging out with me and maybe more. Everything was perfect about her. She was the same year as me, a single in Warren, etc. she sent me photos of herself and we made plans to meet up before I reverse searched her photos and found out that it was just some random cam model from New Orleans. 

The whole thing was really weird though because we actually made plans to meet up so I dont really know why this person would have done that. I kind of regret not just going because Im really curious now.  "
713, Dude why the fuck are you responding like this? 
714," Honestly the biggest problem I used to have with it was I felt that I was being the clingy girlfriend. When youre sending 10 paragraph long texts a day without a response until that night, I guess its easy to feel that way. 

The thing that helped me most was my SO telling me that he doesnt mind all the texts and that he does see every one of them not long after theyre sent. He tells me that it makes him happy to feel like hes partially there with me throughout the day and it gives us things to talk about at night when we skype because he will often want to know more about what I messaged him earlier. So that helps a lot. Knowing that he genuinely loves hearing from me and that it keeps me in his mind all day throughout his very busy schedule. 

I hope this was some consolation. Its been this way for us since the beginning and its gotten much easier over time because of his reassurance.  "
715," Im working on all of these things. If you look in my post history, youll see Ive made a post on /r/personalfinance already and am in the process of trying to get all of these things. It doesnt happen overnight. My university is huge and has a reputation for not giving a shit about their students and thats what Im experiencing right now, but Im working my ass off trying to balance finals season, work, and convincing them to give a shit. I came to Reddit for more immediate solutions and have received countless offers of people trying to help. I would say this hasnt been a waste of time.  No need to be patronizing when you have no idea what I am and am not doing "
716," Seems pretty shitty to make light of someone in so much financial trouble that they cant afford clothes or food, but maybe Im just a dumb southerner. Who knows? "
717," My SO is significantly busier than I am most days so most of our communication is just me texting him multiple times a day about whats going on, but he usually cant respond to them until later in the night. He reads them though so it doesnt bother me since I know hes busy. 

We also try to skype every night even if its just for a few minutes. Occasionally we cant though, but thats rare.  "
718, This is really reassuring. Im surprised how many people have been such assholes on this thread.  
719," Oh yeah, awesome, Ill just sleep in the subway even though I have a dorm. Maybe thatll help me acclimate.  "
720," Wow what a helpful comment. So thoughtful. Maybe once it gets colder, my lack of winter clothing will get easier to deal with!!! What a thought.  "
721," I got a full ride that covered my housing and tuition. I dont have any contact with my family. Worked 50 hours a week through high school and saved enough money to travel up here, buy books, etc, but now I dont have time to keep working that much hence Im running out of money to feed myself.  "
722, Ha I wish.  
723," I knew it was going to get cold, I just didnt know how bad it would be. Its pretty hard to imagine if youre from a climate that never gets to this temperature.  "
724, Im trying to get one right now. I dont have any time though with my current job and classes so no one has hired me since I can only work weekends.  
725, Did you mean theyre $100? I can not afford that at all. I dont even have close to that much money right now.  
726, Im looking at vests and I cant tell whether or not the super cheap ones are good enough. Im having a hard time affording food and so anything I buy for the winter is taking away money for that so Im trying to be super frugal if I can.  
727," How much would these items be? 

Im broke to the point where Im having difficulty affording food so Im worried about the cost.  "
728," I dont know if anyone will be able to give me advice, but today was the coldest temperature Ive ever felt with the wind chill. I was literally dressed in my warmest outfit (gloves, a hat, a scarf, the heaviest coat I own, and fleece leggings) and I was in so much pain from the cold that I started tearing up after being outside for ten minutes. 

Im an incredibly broke college student who cannot afford to buy a heavier coat or better winter gear. Does anyone have any tips to surviving my first real winter? Im terrified of it getting colder than this. I didnt expect it to be so painful. "
729," I have a big fear of being not enough for my boyfriend. In the past, I was in a long term open relationship, but she cheated on me emotionally and was having another serious relationship behind my back with a guy I had asked her not to sleep with. So I think about that a lot. 

Honestly its just a lot of reassurance that my boyfriend gives me. Hes understanding and knows why Id be scared so he knows exactly what to tell me and do to make me feel better. He tells me often how Im still the best hes ever had and tells me all the things I give him that no one else can. So yes, its gotten easier over time because Ive learned that its okay. We talk a lot about his sexual encounters and even joke about them. Its a casual conversation so it normalizes it. 

I think Id have a hard time with the dont ask, dont tell rule because I want it to be normal. I want us to laugh about things that went wrong and take away things he liked that other girls did. 

I hope this helps. Good luck in this! I promise that being an easily jealous person and being nonmonogamous can work together!!! "
730," Yeah I think this is a great way to do things. A lot of people I know have a not in the house rule. 

I think hearing about her experience (even if its not like full details) will help a lot. I know thats what my boyfriend and I do. I suffer from jealousy a lot when he sleeps with other people, but hearing him tell me how great of a time he had, and then realizing its still me hes consistently coming back to, makes things much easier! Because I know its making him happy, but since Im the one hes fully committing to, well then I must make him much happier than even the other person did! "
731," Honestly, this whole situation was so bound to happen. It sounds like you actually dont like having an open relationship and have come to accept it by pretending that only you are the one taking advantage of it. Ive never done the dont ask, dont tell rule, but couples I know who have never do that because they want to act like its not happening. They just do it because even though they know their partner is sleeping with others, they dont want to necessarily hear about it. 

Sorry to be blunt like this, but the posts on here about guys loving their open relationship until they realize that they arent the only ones getting anything are so ridiculous. Non-monogamy isnt about fooling yourself into being okay with it. 

Sounds like you need to rethink the terms of your relationship entirely. It seems like you just really want a closed relationship where you can be sure she isnt sleeping with someone else.  "
732, Oh my god this is so crazy. I seriously thought I was the only one. I clicked on this thread to comment this because I thought it was so uncommon and specific.  
733, Hojo is the best freshman dorm.  
734," Oh my god, I (female) also called my very feminine ex girlfriend Daddy and I seriously thought we were the only people who did that.  "
735," She left me 6 months ago after I found out she had been cheating on me for the last year of our relationship. 

Emotionally, I still miss her everyday. But I know things are better. Im closer to friends who I never saw because I spent so much time with her. Im in another relationship with someone who reminds me everyday how much they love me and who was there for me through the breakup. Her leaving me made me realize what was so bad about our relationship and makes me appreciate my current one even more because of how healthy and loving it is.  "
736, This is my first winter outside of the Deep South and Ive never even seen snow so I am terrified.  
737, 15 minutes!!! Im currently waiting for him right now!! 
738, A whole one? each is about 2 inches long.  
739," So thats the problem. A friend of mine gave me a pack that he had already had some out of. So Im not sure how many were originally in, but there are about 7 now.  "
740, No and Ive since left that stall about five minutes ago.  
741, Its a single bathroom so its got the sink and all in there with it.  
742, Its very clean and really nice. Id argue a 10.  
743," I love both so much and its really hard to choose. I think I prefer most dogs over most cats, but the few affectionate and snuggly cats I definitely like more than dogs.  "
744, Im not left handed.  
745, Im not too worried about people knowing Im crying.  
746," Hahaha this is an interesting question. 

Probably quality. I think most people Ive cried around end up crying too.  "
747," Whole wheat usually, but sometimes I get a craving for white.  "
748, Mayonnaise all the way.  
749," Really? I feel like sandwiches are so neutral to most people. Never met someone who actively doesnt like them. 

Hmm, I wanna say crying right now, haha, because Ive been doing this for a lot longer than I think is normal. "
750," I really like sandwiches. The type of sandwich varies, but honestly that might be my favorite type of food. 

I also really like soup dumplings.  "
751," Sometimes. It comes in waves. The crying doesnt seem to stop, but it goes back and forth between being quiet tears to full on gross sobbing.  "
752, Thank you so much for caring for some stranger on the internet. Any suggestion helps.  
753, Unfortunately not. Its just a weird little office bathroom.  
754, Its a weird bathroom. The stalls have actual doors with locking doorknobs. Like several regular bathrooms in one room.  
755," Oh my gosh!!!! After I met my bf for the first time, we didnt see each other again for almost a year too and wow oh wow, I honestly think that second time was my favorite visit so far. 

Also I think this might be the 5th visit but HE IS COMING TO SEE ME IN TWO DAYS WOW "
756," Yeah I didnt want to state what I thought would be an unpopular opinion, but Im not a fan.  "
757," I would suggest looking up the actual course list and talking about specific classes that sound interesting or a professor or something. Remember that they read thousands of these so make it specific to BU, not something you could write for any school.  "
758, Boston! 
759," I was bullied a little in middle school, but my high school was pretty chill. I didnt get bullied, nor was I a bully. I think very few people in my high school were bullied.  "
760," It doesnt make me gag, but it just tastes like two good things that dont go great together.  "
761, I have definitely considered this. Especially being in sociology.  
762, Im not sure. Ive been on Reddit for a really long time and was lurking for a couple years before then. Cant really remember what made me make an account.  
763," Ive thought of both of those things, but I really value genuine connections with people so I dont really like how one sided both of those careers are.  "
764," Honestly, I just wouldnt work. Im not sure what Id do instead but if I just didnt have to worry about money, Id spend my life doing whatever I wanted to do. I think Id honestly stay in school  and just keep learning about shit until I found something I wanted to do. 

Id like to meet a lot of people in my life. If I could get paid to just talk to many different kinds of people, thatd be great.  "
765," Im not doing anything related to school while Im back in Atlanta. The joy of sociology majors is that they have very little work. I have to read a lot for classes, but very little active work.  "
766, Sociology at the moment because I really couldnt decide what else I was interested in. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life.  
767," Im probably just seeing my two close friends and my younger brother, so not many people at all! "
768," Im just going back for thanksgiving! I didnt want to stay in my dorm alone over the break. 

Im currently going to University in Boston! "
769, Im actually just staying with a friend. I dont have much contact with my immediate family. I may see my younger brother though. Hes 16 and is a busser at a small restaurant.  
770, I fucking loved high school and genuinely hate university. Im very worried I am one of these.  
771," Adding on to a past comment, Ive only gotten my hair cut once here and it was at Dellaria. I think I paid $45 or so to go from waist length hair to a pixie cut and it was pretty good!!

If youre looking for just a trim though or something not as drastic as mine, honestly Id suggest just going to Great Clips to save money.  "
772," This girl seems like she really appreciates the advice, so perhaps she really did need it. 

However, I was on tinder before 18 because the age of consent in my state is 16 and I can assure you I was perfectly fine. I think its weird to assume that if youre under 18, you always, no matter what, have absolutely no idea what you want. Im still young now, but Ive stayed pretty steady in my opinions.  "
773," I do have a small meal plan. It's just that it gives me a certain number of meals per semester and mine equals about 1 a day. I'm very close to having used them all (about 4 left) because I've been eating them more than once a day. I just didn't think straight and instead of spending money on food in the beginning, I just used all my meals.
 "
774, I am in a dorm so I have no appliances to cook eggs or maize with. I only have a refrigerator and a microwave. 
775," Thank you for all of this lovely advice. I agree that this problem is very ignored. Even among some of my acquaintances here, I talk about having no money to buy food and they automatically assume it's because I spent it on something stupid and they think it's a joke. It's a joke even among poor college students themselves.

I actually cannot find any info about a student union at my university (Boston University). "
776," No, I'm not emancipated. 

I'm in Boston "
777," Hey all, I just found this subreddit while on a search to make money. Im currently a freshman in university on a full ride. I have a work study job here, but I only make $11 an hour and I only have time to work 8 hours a week. 

Im completely freaking out because I had an emergency recently that left me with $4 and I need to buy food. I can get by for the next couple days to a week on what I already have, but is there anything I can do about this?

I cut contact with my family when I moved here because I was supporting myself anyway working 30-40 hours a week and my parents are both drug addicts with no money. I paid for everything to get here and its left me with literally nothing. I just dont know what to do and I need to know what can help me in a relatively short time. I am thinking about maybe getting a loan but I dont know how that works since it wouldnt even be a student loan. My tuition is already covered. I just need money for food and transportation to work. 

Any advice would be lovely. Thank you "
778," So even though my piercing was likely healed completely, I still cant wear surgical steel? "
779, Yes I still have the clicker in. The only problem is that I dont think I can put my horseshoe back in myself because its just so small that I couldnt even get it out. Id have to wait to make it to a piercer this weekend or maybe later.  
780," You walk. The bus stops are just at random places on the side of comm ave. You learn where they are, but they arent marked or covered.  "
781," Hey there! Thanks for such a long and in-depth reply!

Ive noticed this mostly in musical theatre songs as that is usually what I have to audition with. However, I just notice this whenever Im singing along with music I like (Esperanza Spalding, Hiatus Kaiyote, Ella Fitzgerald). Im also 19 and Ive been singing since I could talk, but I was in choirs or theatres doing it with training since I was about 12.  "
782," It's such a strange problem to have because I consider myself a very emotional person who conveys her emotions well and often. It just disappears when I sing. Maybe I just think too much and don't let go?

I've had so many casting directors for musicals and choral directors just tell me that I don't have the emotion to sing solos. I get decent ensemble parts and am one of the strongest in my section in choirs, but it's just because I can hit the notes with precision and blend with others well. I can't stand alone at all. "
783," Oh yeah definitely. I mean, not always things this emotional, but I would say most of the stuff I sing for fun or audition with are songs with intense emotions because Im a decent actor so I can portray it with my physical body. Its just the voice that always is so disconnected. Thats a good way to describe it. I just sound so disconnected. 

Perhaps this is a problem that cant really be fixed. Ive spent literally years trying to fix it.  "
784," I could maybe send a recording later, but honestly, its kind of like that. I feel like I have emotion while Im singing, like I definitely feel it, but I just dont get how to portray it well while Im singing. Its obvious in my face, I guess, but if you were to just hear my voice, it just sounds flat emotion-wise.  "
785," Hey OP! Im not the original responder, but the late Wednesday class is probably just an exam period so youll only go if you have an exam. Your professor should let you know for sure when you first attend class. However, the mom, early wed, and fri are all classes you have to attend every week. 

The sections arent something you need to worry about. Each professor usually will teach the same class but at different times to accommodate many students schedules, but youve already picked a section that works best for you so the other sections dont matter. 

Basically every time and day thats listed by that class, you should go to, except the late Wednesday lecture since its probably an exam period.  "
786," Yes definitely. My opinion comes from a place of having a similar restriction on my ex which ended up ultimately putting too much stress on her causing her to leave me. 

Not that this will necessarily happen to OP, but its a very controlling behavior to completely normalize long term. Communication seems more important to their relationship.  "
787," A curfew seems a bit controlling...

I get feeling nervous, but I feel like that can be solved with communication, like your SO telling you what he's up to and when he thinks he'll be home. But a curfew? "
788, I got it in mid-June so about 5 months.  
789, I took beginning jazz for about 3 weeks before I decided it totally wasnt worth it and that Id rather have an extra hour + the time it took to walk to fitrec from east campus and dropped it.  
790, That I have experienced unconditional love 
791," No way you need to stop this immediately. I would almost argue that this is a deal breaker. It crosses into scary, almost assault territory. 

My boyfriend and I love choking, but there was one time he got a little too excited and pressed too hard and immediately started crying. He stopped without a word and we quit everything we were doing even though he told me later he was super fucking into it, more than usual up until that point. He held me and apologized and almost cried himself because he was so worried he lost that much control. This is how your husband should have responded. It is terrifying that he didnt and equally terrifying that the top comments dont seem to be taking this seriously.  "
792," We had been just best friends for a year before he came to visit me in my city. The moment I saw him across the parking lot of the apartment he was renting, everything froze. I remember when he hugged me, I got chills and realized literally in that moment that I was in love with him and had been avoiding recognizing that for so long. Every time he touched me, it was actually electric. I thought that was bullshit for so long but the first time we kissed, I just melted into him. It was amazing. We both told the other we were in love within three days of meeting.  "
793," Holy shit thats honestly terrible. 

I mean, Im from Georgia so my sex ed was just dont have sex and heres a bunch of photos of stds to make sure you dont. No mention of contraception or even an anatomy lesson. I guess I just assume people use the internet enough to understand.  "
794," The first time I ever met my long distance boyfriend after a year and a half of knowing each other, I started my period the night before he got here and I literally sobbed. I knew he wouldnt care but I wanted the first time we ever slept together to be amazing. 

Anyway, it still totally was, but it was hella messy. I think it made us closer though because I felt so gross and he still made me feel sexy.  "
795," I was super interested in going until I found out it was basically just a sex ed class. Im glad we have that resource but like, I feel like most people in college know all that stuff already?? "
796," Im a first year currently so I cant super accurately answer your other questions, but honestly the Hojo dorms are the way to go. I believe theyre the only freshman dorm with private bathrooms and AC (which is so necessary in the first month). I dont even understand why they arent popular. 
 "
797," I know this is an old thread, but I had to respond. I recently visited my boyfriend in Quebec and we had no idea what was wrong with him, but he was uncontrollably shaking and passing out in the waiting room. I had never been so scared in my life. We were there for almost 6 hours waiting. I genuinely thought he would die. His friends had similar stories of literally bleeding all over waiting rooms for hours in Quebec. 

However, Ive heard Quebec is close to the worst place to be for hospital waiting rooms.  "
798," Its hard for me to cringe at this. Ive been here before and sometimes it just is all you need to feel slightly okay in that moment. Im not saying its healthy at all, but I understand where this person is coming from.  "
799," No question to ask, but I think Id really love hanging out with you. You seem hella cool. 

I have a lot of stick and pokes that have absolutely no meaning and look pretty obviously hand drawn. Everyone thinks theyre terrible, but its the memory behind each one and the friend I trusted enough to stick a needle in my skin that matters to me.  "
800, My great grandmother has this. She says that she sometimes cant sleep at night because gay men have orgies in her bed and that theres a mad scientist in the hallway experimenting on rats.  
801, How can I get my hands on some of these? 
802, Really?? That sounds lovely!! Thank you for suggesting this.  
803," Sorry, obviously not from here and have only been here for a month.  "
804," Like I told the other guy, thanks so much for the response, but we are both 19 unfortunately.  "
805," Hey thanks for the response, but my friend and I are both only 19.  "
806, Honestly the science center is very much aimed at kids as well. I went with my boyfriend thinking it would be great for us and it ended up being pretty boring and we felt super out of place among all the families with their young kids.  
807, I would definitely recommend the science museum for kids.  
808," I honestly feel like I have a ton of unpopular opinions about Boston. It feels like theres less culture and diversity here which no one else agrees with. I feel that so strongly though. 

However, I feel like there are way more things going on here than there ever were in Atlanta. I spend more time out in Boston at various public free events that Atlanta never seemed to have. Everything is free here.  "
809," Whats on my mind is that I miss Atlanta so badly and Boston will never compare. 

This is the first pride Ive missed since I was 10! "
810," I personally have not had a single hookup from BU so far, but Boston itself has provided a lot.  "
811," Ill be thinking about you the next time I light up. Im almost 19 and I have no idea how I would take that sort of news. Youre super strong, dude, and everyone in this community is rooting for you.  "
812," Damn dude I totally feel this. 

My SO and I have a pretty substantial age gap and he was super worried that with me going to college, I would meet someone else who could be there for me physically everyday. We were sitting in the bath together and he just started crying, but when I reassured him that I was in this for the long run, we shared a very beautiful kiss as well. 

Anyway I definitely feel you. Im happy youll see each other soon! "
813, Oh is this copypasta? I had never seen it before.  
814," No advice, but just wanted to let you know that I'm also a first year and only one of my profs has put in grades. Most of my friends also have none in though.  "
815," Hey dude I'm a first year girl here and I really have only made one friend since getting here. I'd be so open to meeting you and I'm in hojo, so I'm not too far away!!

If you're interested, pm me and we can have lunch or dinner or something at Bay State!!

(Also how did you snag a single in a brownstone????? That's so fucking lucky. I'd kill for that) "
816, This was also a thing at my high school! 
817," I wish! I tried to snag tickets, but they sold out so fast. Have tons of fun though! I'm sure it's going to be amazing.  "
818," Yeah I have slept with people I didn't know super well and it's always way more awkward and less forgiving in a way. If I do something stupid while sleeping with a friend, it isn't as weird as it is with a stranger. I've never had friendships go south because I had sex with them. 

I would say I'm way more into girls than I am into men, but I have slept with a disproportionate amount of guys because they're easier to come across. If I had my way, it would be more women, but it's hard to find girls who like girls when you're a super feminine bisexual because no one assumes you like women.  "
819," I think it really depends on your financial situation. 

My family made a little over $10,000 a year and BU gave me $68,000 in financial aid and a random scholarship I didn't apply to that has no other info other than that it is for people ""with potential"". I only pay about $1,500 a year right now and that's just for my health insurance.  "
820, I also met Tommy Wiseau about a year ago and it's still such a weird memory.  
821," I don't understand why this an unpopular opinion. I don't support violence and I do think it should have stayed peaceful, but the cop reacted entirely 100% wrong and they deserve backlash.  "
822," It's not too bad for me. I think it really depends on who you and your partner are. I've had some partners I would never have an open relationship with because the trust wasn't there or for other reasons. However, my current partner and I have no problems with it because I trust him fully and I know that at the end of the day, it's me that he wants. I'm the person he repeatedly comes back to. I definitely feel jealous sometimes, but it's easily resolved by talking to him  "
823," Been in a long distance relationship for a bit over a year now. We're in an open relationship so that helps a lot, but when we don't have other partners, we try to have sexy skype sessions as much as possible.  "
824, I scrolled down hoping to find this game. Dark Cloud 2 was actually the first video game I ever played and I remember buying strategy guides and spending hours on it and still never beating it.  
825, There's not? That's pretty disappointing. Seems I never ran out of things to explore back in Atlanta.  
826, I'm a girl and this has been happening to me for so long and I'm very confused.  
827, I got a full ride for all 4 years to a $75k per year private university after growing up with two drug addicted parents and having complex PTSD 
828, We wouldn't have had fun because you obviously didn't read my post about needing FRIENDS. Go somewhere else with your propositions. They werent welcome here.  
829, Fuck off.  
830," I live in Hojo so I'm at Bay State most often. I think it's the prettiest and everyone over here thinks it's the best, but I actually think Warren has better food.  "
831," This made me tear up. I'm missing my boyfriend terribly, but this brought a sappy smile to my face. Best of luck to you two "
832, Thank you. Really thank you so much. This was very comforting to read.  
833," Funny, we are actually in the same situation. He is in Montreal and I am going to Boston. Before moving to Boston, I was in Atlanta though so I'm trying to keep my mindset positive since I am way closer to him than I was before.  "
834," I also imagine that someone is holding me. Often, I'll talk to myself like I'm someone else or hold my own hand trying to pretend it's another person. I wish I could give you advice.  "
835," Yeah if you guys wanna meet up somewhere, I'm down! I am staying right off the Atwater metro station so I can get to pretty much anywhere.  "
836," Not looking for a roommate, but I just wanted to say that you seem really fucking cool and I hope you have some luck! "
837, Ahh a beautiful couple!!!! I'm so happy for you.  
838," My ex girlfriend and I (also a girl) used to do this. It was our main thing and during sex, I'd go so far as to refer to her vagina as a dick in every sense, even saying I was giving her a blowjob and everything. I also called her Daddy and we took it to some crazy levels. We got a strap on and we'd literally treat it like it was real in every sense. 

Honestly I also thought I was alone.  "
839," This is probably going to get buried, but I'm ridding Greyhound for the first time in a couple weeks. I'm a very small 18 year old girl who will be alone. Is it safe for me to ride Greyhound? I hate to admit that I'm a little nervous that my safety is in jeopardy.  "
840," I know these are overdone, but my schedule looks a lot different than everyone else's. I'm a math major and a possible gender and sexuality minor. Any advice? "
841, Oh damn I work there! Wish I would have seen this in time to be you all's server!! 
842," Wow oh wow, you two are so beautiful!!

Where are you both from and how long have you been together? "
843," I know I am one person out of millions, but a guy having a micro penis wouldn't be a deal breaker for me in the slightest and a part of me thinks I'd actually enjoy it a lot. 

You'll find someone. I'm not the only one. There are probably tons of women who feel similarly.  "
844," It's crazy how our minds work when we're high. I got pretty high with a close friend one night and when we woke up, she couldn't find her glasses. She ended up having to stay home the whole day because she couldn't drive or go to classes without them. She calls me later that evening and said she found them in an empty chip bag sitting on her dresser. We had a good laugh about that one.  "
845, I have not actually! Never even heard of it.  
846," I did!! And yes yes, it's only a cheap 5 hour train ride away from Boston, so I will be there often hopefully. 

He is studying at McGill! "
847," We have been sort of officially together for a little over a year. I've only seen him three times, once in May 2016, again this past January, and I just got back from coming to visit him for the first time a week ago. I'm seeing him again though for two straight weeks in August!!

He actually doesn't speak French that well, haha! He's originally from Calgary and is only there finishing his phd. 

We hope to close the gap one day, but we are both in very transitional periods of our lives. I'm going to Boston for school in the fall and am going to be there for at least a few years, but after he finishes his degree, he has no idea where he's going for his post doctorate. Fingers crossed he can get into a good place in Boston! "
848," I'm in Atlanta and he's in Montreal so quite a bit further than 7 hours!

We met because I made a post on raisedbynarcissists that resonated with him so much that he made an account just to message me (he was just sort of browsing before) and we talked really irregularly through Reddit for a year before we skyped for the first time and became best friends. He visited me another year later and I unexpectedly fell in love!

How long have you guys been together? Any plans on closing the gap? "
849," I am an American dating a Canadian I met on Reddit so that's pretty cool!

How did you guys meet exactly? Through what subreddit? Did he message you or did you message him? "
850," That's fair. I hope I don't come across as fetishizing or commodifying it. 

Does this play into your sexuality at all? I know that you're straight, but I mean, do you have a fetish for cross dressing or is it only just because you like the way it looks? "
851," Do you want people to think you're a biological woman? Is that part of the fun? 

Also do you wear a wig when you cross dress or do you have an androgynous hair cut? 

Sorry for all the questions. I've met lots of cross dressing men, but never a straight one and I'm genuinely curious if the desire to do it is the same as for gay men.  "
852," When you're out cross dressing, do people ever mistake you for a biological woman?  "
853," I am going through the same thing, OP. I don't know if it helps you to hear that, but this post made me feel less alone. 

My girlfriend and I just celebrated our three year anniversary. She's dealt with me wonderfully for so long. A week ago, I found out she was carrying on a secret relationship behind my back because she didn't want to be with me anymore and was unhappy, but felt like she couldn't leave because I'd kill my self. 

We are still sort of together, but it's complicated and she's going to leave me at any minute. When she told me that she didn't want me to forgive her for what she did and that she wanted me to hate her and leave her so she could move on, I'd realized I'd lost her and there was nothing I could say to make her stay. I had a two hour long panic attack in which I completely lost myself and ended up passing out. I think that's the only reason she stayed because she still loves me and is worried I won't make it without her. 

The most painful part is that I just now am able to get help. I'm getting medication next week. If she could have just waited, she would have seen me get better and our relationship could have been healthy. 

I don't have any advice for you. I have been broken for the past week, self medicating in ways I shouldn't be. I feel for you. Feel free to message me if you think it would help to talk. I believe we are feeling very similar things right now.  "
854," I know the main point of this is for cheap international travel and that domestic flights are cheap compared to this already, but do you also find super discounted domestic flights? "
855," Why is it that when women sleep with a ton of different men, people say they get looser, but if a woman sleeps with the same man more times than she's ever slept with someone else, no one says she gets looser?

That concept is literally just slut shaming.  "
856," Ah okay maybe the loans I was getting were through the school or something. The whole thing was pretty unclear and the finaid department didn't help me a lot. 

And yeah sorry about getting it waived. It was weirdly simple for me, but I've heard that's uncommon.  "
857," I am not a transfer student (accepted to go right out of high school), but I also had an issue with the admissions deposit. 

When I talked to financial aid, they made it sound like you couldn't get a loan that would be available to you in time to pay it. They said my loans wouldn't be available until I began school. I'm not sure how loans work in full so I just trusted that. 

However, I did call admissions and asked to get it waived and it was kind of a hassle. My situation was a little different though because I got a full ride so they knew I couldn't pay it. I would suggest you just call and ask. All they had me do was send the envelope back to them with admission fee waived on the front and it was fine.  "
858," I feel like sort of an expert on sex while using pot (I'm not), but I often feel like I have a threshold before sex is too hard. 

Like, if I get too high, I just can't focus on anything and I get too in my head. I would suggest just smoking lightly and checking how you feel every few minutes. My highs tend to be drastically sexual to the point where I cannot be around people I'm not supposed to sleep with, so maybe it just depends on the person.  "
859, I really feel this.  
860, (I am definitely a socialist so kind of?) 
861," I used to watch Adventure Time a lot and I still do, but I'm so far behind and the story is too complicated to pick up with now honestly. 

Other than that, I don't really watch cartoons.  "
862, Ice cream definitely 
863, I say the chickens should form their own group. I'm all for third parties.  
864," I'm in Atlanta and no, I've never even been close to that far north.  "
865, First HJ and BJ were when I was 15-16 I think. I'm not sure.  
866," I applied as an English major, but I really only like writing for myself, so I'll probably just take a bunch of different classes and decide for sure on something later.  "
867," I try not to have regrets about things and I also feel like I don't really lose my rationale when I'm not sober. I may lose my inhibitions, but I don't typically do things I didn't already want to. 

I can't even really think about anything I've done that was particularly bad while high.  "
868, You use it after almost every response. I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.  
869," You really like that emoji, huh?

I'm not sure. There is sex therapy and shit though and I feel like that could definitely help. So long as they don't act on it, I don't care what they do, but I imagine it would be very hard for them and they should try to get help if they can.  "
870," Feeling that love? No, but acting on it? Yes definitely a crime. 

People who feel that just need help.  "
871," My last message sent: Yo so Caroline doesn't have any weed rn either soooooooooo I don't know what you wanna do today.

My last message received: This is beautiful I would love to share drugs and alcohol with you friends yes family bonding 

Wow they are both about drugs cool "
872," Long story short, an older dude from England comes to the US to teach and lives with a woman who has a 12 year old daughter. He falls in love with her daughter and marries her mother to get closer to her and it's super fucked up, but also so well written.  "
873, This is a hard question. I don't get embarrassed too easily. I honestly can't remember the last time I was embarrassed.  
874, Reference to the opening chapter of Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov  
875, Damn I haven't even seen the ending of titanic but reading this made me tear up.  
876," Thank you so much. My girlfriend and I are working our hardest to keep things positive and healthy until I go to college in the fall and get therapy for free. I am hoping that will make things easier for us both as it seems like that's what has worked so well for you. 

I definitely need to work on being okay apart from her. I have hobbies that I can do alone, but I'm unhappy doing them alone and would rather be doing them beside her. It makes it hard to be independent when even my alone time activities are only enjoyable when I'm near her.  "
877," I am 18 years old and I also have BPD or bipolar disorder (no one is really sure which, but they know it's one or both). I just want to say that you give me hope. Sometimes I worry that I'll never be in a healthy relationship. I've been with my current girlfriend for 3 years and my mental illness has wrecked her. I try my best everyday and sometimes it seems like it's getting better only to fall apart again. 

So I guess my question is how has your illness affected your relationship and how do you deal with that in a productive and healthy way? How does your husband deal with it? "
878," This happened to me about a month after the game came out. I sank almost 2 straight days into it and spent hours on the phone with support until they basically told me there was nothing they could do. 

I still can't bear to try to start again.  "
879," I also just got accepted into BU and was feeling pretty scared since I can't visit the campus before I start orientation, but I wanted you to know that saying BU hosted Hannibal Buress might possibly have changed my entire mindset.  "
880," Ah yeah, I didn't know how to make that work and just hoped it would make sense. Hopefully I clarified.  "
881, She likes it when I call her daddy and she likes imagining she has a cock to fuck me with.  
882," No. 

We are both girls.  "
883, I also rewrote it 5 times to make sure it was understandable and I still failed haha 
884," When my girlfriend asked me to call her daddy and while she was fingering me, she kept talking about ""how badly daddy wishes he had a cock to shove into my pussy""

It was really insane to hear something so taboo and so hot at the same time.  "
885, An update is absolutely necessary. Good luck!! 
886," Love handles

I am obsessed with girls who have love handles. If I can't grab the pudge above/around your hips, I'm not interested. I also hate flat stomachs. I'm not into overweight girls, but just a normal amount of a tummy is really sexy and sweet.  "
887," I really don't think you can say that definitively, the reason they should break up is because they're too young to deal with it. Yes, they probably won't be together forever because of the age, but that doesn't mean they're incapable of productively discussing a problem.  "
888, I can do that later this evening definitely. I'll PM you.  
889, My father sells because she can't work. It's a catch 22 situation. I'm just waiting until the summer to leave.  
890," I don't have anything to add that hasn't already been said, but ruin his fucking career. He doesn't deserve it. Stay strong and know that he is in the wrong, not you.  "
891, Yeah I will definitely go this route if she doesn't respond to my text by the time I get home.  
892," I've gotten so many different locks, but she manages to get through every one and I really have no clue how.  "
893, She doesn't have a car. She pretty much never even leaves her room.  
894, Yeah I'm an active member.  
895, She keeps her room locked and she's always home.  
896, She normally cries and says she feels bad and begs for my forgiveness. It's all really petty and childish. It just might go differently if she feels weird about taking it. She probably didn't even think it through.  
897," I'm almost certain she isn't using it. She's a drug addict, but she definitely has those sorts of boundaries. I feel like the most likely thing is that she took it because she felt like I shouldn't have it. The only thing that contradicts this is that she didn't take the other things.
 "
898, Welcome! Where from in Canada? My long distance partner is in Montreal and he always seems to enjoy himself here. Hope you do the same! 
899," Ah, apologies. I don't actually know how locks work. 

My father once added a piece to the door frame on the inside near the latch to make it ""impossible"", but apparently it's not.  "
900," It's not a latch. It's an actual doorknob lock. I'm not sure how it works, but I know that's how she's doing it.  "
901," The alarm on my phone seems at least like a peace of mind so I have an idea of what to expect when I come home. I'm not sure it would stop the actual act, but the knowledge of it would help me.  "
902," I think this is actually a good plan. I'm not sure it would change anything, but I will tell her and see where that goes.  "
903, Thank you for this reply. I was hoping someone would have knowledge of a type of lock that's hard to pick. I don't know how she does it. I think she uses a credit card or something. I'm not sure she has actual experience picking a lock.  
904," I said that I have been in foster care before and so has my brother and it was way worse. Even though he'd only be there a year or so, both of us would prefer he stay out of it.  "
905," I would. Really I would, but I would lose my home because both of my parents are drug addicts and I have nowhere else to go. And my underage brother would end up in foster care (we've both been before and it was not any better). 

It's really awful to be stuck in such a limbo with this.  "
906," As someone who loves PC games but can't afford to buy a PC that can play them/has the time to learn to build one, I would really love something like this.  "
907," I also had the issue of being incredibly small and it wasn't until I was with a partner for the first time that I had even had the want for penetration. 

So I think the thing is that you have to really want it and not think too much about the actual act of it. When I masturbate, I usually never have the urge to have something in me. It feels like an unwelcome distraction, but when I'm with a partner, it's all I want. 

I also am incredibly physically small in every way so it's often still an issue, however, fingers never are so I'm sure that unless you have a medical problem, it'll work out fine the more you try and get comfortable with it.  "
908," 18 F - for women, I usually don't mind as long as it's not crazy and I can easily get around it. I do prefer clean shaven though for myself and for others, but it's not a strong preference. 

For men, I usually feel the same about anything being fine so long as it doesn't get in the way.  "
909," I didn't know other people experienced this. I've always thought it is just because I'm small in stature (barely 5'), but I feel like I hold my own very well and I typically lead conversations...except I still managed to get ignored and walked in front of. 

This definitely happens to me way often than it should and even my girlfriend will notice it when we are in public, but people have no problem literally shoving me aside. It's really strange and I would think people would almost be more considerate of me because I'm so small.  "
910," This is the first thing on Reddit that made me very emotional to read. I have no advice and I know these types of comments aren't exactly helpful for this sort of thing, but I wish the absolute best for you and your family. I admire your strength on a ridiculous level and I wish I had more to say to help.  "
911, Ooh I might try doing this! 
912," I have a long distance friend/lover/boyfriend-ish person who hypnotizes me over skype but also in person when he comes to visit and we do hypnosis induced orgasms occasionally. 

In my experience (I am also female so I'm not sure if this is the demographic you're after), they feel closer to ruined orgasms than an actual orgasm. They're not quite as frustrating as a ruined one, but they are much less intense and the contractions and all are much shallower and slower. I usually am not 100% satisfied after them.  "
913," This is 100% possible. I feel the exact same about everything you've written and I've gotten so lucky to have a guy in my life who is absolutely perfect and takes care of me and trains me and does everything you've described. 

It takes time though. And it's hard. It sucks to wait and it sucks to have a desire that no one seems to be able to fill. I slept with a decent number of guys hoping every time that it was just sexual frustration and it'd go away if I slept with someone, but it never did. I get that it's a super specific urge. 

But you will find someone. I promise. Get out there in the bdsm community and meet people! It still will take time, but it will be loads easier if you take initiative. Good luck 3 "
914," Nope, it was an Asian bakery on Buford Highway. Decided to treat myself to something nice after voting and that ended up being a mistake.  "
915," Yeah that makes sense. I guess $200 just seems like a whole lot to me, which makes sense considering I'm in high school and all that. I also was surprised because most people I talked to before I found out how much it was said it would likely be incredibly cheap (less than 100). 

I will probably just admit my wrongdoing and hope they reduce it at least a little.  "
916," Yeah Doraville is so fucked like that honestly. Especially Buford Highway area (which is where I was). That one parking lot is one of the few that you can't turn left out of. The two bordering it, you can. It makes no sense.  "
917, Thank you so much. This has been the most helpful answer. I think I just got so worried because I had no reference point for what to expect.  
918," Well actually they ended up being at fault for the whole thing, but still got a $150 ticket after already totaling their car before then and having a $95 ticket. I feel like it doesn't add up.  "
919," Yeah man, you think I don't know that? I fucked up. I already admitted that. Thanks for the unnecessary input.  "
920, I guess the thing is do I go and still plead guilty? I don't even have the slightest idea of how court works or anything. Would I have to plead not guilty for a reduced fine? 
921, So this whole thing of them throwing out the ticket if the cop doesn't show up would only happen if I pled not guilty and had a later court date? 
922, Haha yeah I know it was wrong which is fine. It's mostly the issue of me not having the money to pay it nor no way of getting that money.  
923, I guess I'm just comparing it to the $150 ticket someone I know got for hitting two cars and totaling hers.  
924, Really? Would you say it's common for the officer to show or no? 
925," Ah thank you so much for being so kind!

I'm actually currently in a poly type of situation with my girlfriend of two years and a long distance connection of almost a year and the dream is to all be together after college, so we've got our fingers crossed! "
926," I don't have a question, but just dropping by to say that you all are living my dream life and it's so inspiring that this is something that can work out. Really gives me hope that this will be a possibility for me in the future 3 "
927," You'd be surprised. With normal makeup on, I get into bars without being carded.  "
928," Yeah I definitely don't think it's a bad thing! Plus, when I put on my everyday makeup, I look my age, so it's not that terrible.  "
929, A children's dentistry  
930," Lack of makeup, my dude. I have a super baby face. It's a problem.  "
931," Nope, I'm 18. I said it in a comment thread that got deleted earlier.  "
932," I did, but mostly people were just disappointed that there were no actual eggos in the box because they were all stoned college kids.  "
933, Always have to ruin the party 
934," I only had two people recognize me at this pretty huge party, but maybe they were just all lame.  "
935," I'm 18. No worries, dude, you're safe. (And thank you!) "
936, Thanks so much! I'm 4'11.  
937,  
938, Melody Dean by Amanda Palmer (Neil Gaiman's very poly wife)!! 
939," Any reason why it would say I need to call my county office? I registered over the summer and this is my first time voting and I just assumed I was registered, but I checked and I'm not.  "
940, Thank you so much. I'll add a specific price a bit lower than that because I got them for free anyway.  
941, Thanks so much for pointing this out. I didn't know what info would be relevant. Would the section be the same as the aisle (333R) because I don't see anything labeled as section on the tickets.  
942," Wow dude this is incredible! I'm taking my ACT for the first time next weekend and I'm so fucking nervous seeing as my dream school prefers it over the SAT. It just feels like there's a lot riding on one test and I don't know what to expect. 

I got a 1330 (out of 1600) on my first SAT go around, and I really just want to do better for my ACT. 

How do you even study for something like the ACT? I didn't study for the SAT at all because I just didn't know how.  "
943," No, no, crazy interesting definitely! :) thanks for sharing. It's cool to know someone has that strong of an association with that song.  "
944," End of Small Sanctuary from 3!

It loops perfectly and is my most played song on my phone because I'll just leave it on for hours sometimes.  "
945," Not super sure if this is your style, but one of my favorite local surf punk bands are The Pellys! "
946," We are still together and have been for a little over two years! We went through a super tough spot for literally 95% of the relationship, but things are finally becoming better. She's been out of town for a month and we are planning on ""restarting"" when she gets back.  "
947," Her beauty almost makes me wanna cry sometimes, I swear.  "
948," I have this exact problem. I've tried to be up front about this with people I have interest in a sexual relationship with and they're always so excited to have a girl that always wants sex, but without fail, I end up driving them away because after sex, I'm fine, but just half an hour later, I need it again. 

I don't have any advice, but I guess I wanted to let you know that you aren't alone and that I hope you find a solution to this. Sometimes I feel like I actually will get depressed because I'm not getting enough sex even though I'm getting it twice a day usually.  "
949, Hey there! How did you actually get started? Like what was the process of getting to where you are now? I'm very interested in doing this but have no idea where to start.  
950," I know Aomeng personally actually and heard all about how the prom queen choosing was completely rigged seeing as the calculus teacher runs it and Aomeng watched her for three years before her count up votes and then say ""oh well I like this girl better"".  "
951," Today is me and my SO's 2 year anniversary! We hit up the Atlanta Jazz Festival yesterday and might go again today, but we also might just lie around and enjoy each other's company.  "
952," I can see that. I'm rather interested in the idea of it so I was just wondering if she ever had any personal conflicts about it.

I guess I'm also assuming incorrectly that she is completely dependent on them for money. "
953," How in the world do you find people interested in being sugar daddies? I feel like it'd be hard to find people who weren't actively taking advantage of you. Do you enjoy being a sugar baby? Does it ever feel demeaning or in some ways, misogynistic? "
954," I would love to come if I was in the area. I've always loved being in drama and doing plays and I know how awful it is to even have a full audience, but have a troubled family not even show. I wish I could show up and give them all of the support in the world.  "
955," Hi there! Hopefully this isn't too much for this thread or in any way disrespectful, but what do you think of erotic hypnosis? Is it real hypnosis? Do you think it makes a mockery of the community that practices hypnotherapy and stage hypnosis? Do you think it's ethical and moral?

Thanks! "
956," I remember this from last year's parade!

Sadly, I didn't get to attend this year, but I stood right behind the protestors last year (best spot to see the parade; seriously, everyone refuses to stand there, but they just sort of get out of your way and quietly hold their signs and you can see everything) and some of these guys came by with the flowers. I remember someone from the protesting group got kind of violent and the police just escorted the whole lot of them out. "
957, Thank you! 
958," Last night, I went to a 20s themed party and there was a guy there who I was close friends with years ago, but we sort of fell off because we didn't do the same things anymore. Anyway, I was always really attracted to him and halfway through the night, we began making out and, with the permission of the hostess, went into the other room where some other things happened, but nothing too crazy.

He kept saying how he'd been dreaming of doing this for so long and he had never really done much before me. I was into it without a doubt, but not as much as he was. He was in shock and awe basically at everything. It made me feel good to be the thing that made this guy's dreams come true. "
959," Also make sure if he does use it again, he checks in with you afterwards and don't be afraid to let him know it still bothers you. No need to be ashamed of a thing like that. I have words that bother me too and they seem tame compared to others. Some just hit us in weird ways. "
960," How old were you when you met him and how long has this been going on?

Have you ever been with much older guys like this before him?

Do you think you could ever develop feelings for him? Do you think he'd be okay with that?

Would you consider him your friend? Do you two spend time together outside of sex?

Thanks xx "
961, This is absolutely adorable. I think it would melt my heart to see that. 
962," I've always seen it captioned with something along the lines of she is about to orgasm and she apparently squirts a lot. I haven't seen her in anything else, but that's why they get the towel and the cameraman starts shouting things that are unsexy so she can hold it back. "
963," I have always loved this video. I mean, apart from the dude being hilarious, it's so hot that him pushing into her once made her orgasm like that...and also her trying to hold it back is so hot. I'd love to see more of this. "
964," I've been a subject to a long-term tist for almost a year now and have had a few one-off encounters. I'll try to answer your questions as best as I can, but I also only do audio hypnosis so some of it may not apply to you if you're strictly text, which I have little to no experience with.

I figured out what I wanted from hypnosis by just thinking about other things I was interested in. Hypnosis meshes with a lot of other kinks very well so that helped me. I read people's real life experiences with hypnosis and gravitated towards things that sounded fun to me. My long term tist (who for the sake of ease, we'll call N) also had some very set things he was already interested in and that I was willing to try. Most of my experience with him has been things he thought I'd like and then I did!

Ensuring your safety can be super easy when you have a tist you've known for a while. Generally, I refuse to have a session with someone until I've felt them out well. Just had normal conversations with them for quite a bit and see how I like them as people, if we connect on a level other than that we're both interested in hypnosis, etc. Hypnosis is also not some magical thing that the subject cannot control. No hypnotist is going to be able to wipe your memories if you don't want them too. That's not how it works. The subject has to be as willing as the tist is. You have to actively open your mind to this suggestion. As for limits, go slow. Try things you are 100% comfortable with first and then slowly go further the more you get used to it. 

Again, I stress having a hypnotist who will talk to you in a non-sexual setting before they will hypnotize you. I talked to N for nearly a month before he ever hypnotized me and my girlfriend had known him for 2 years under completely platonic circumstances so I already trusted him well. With other one off encounters, I talk to them for about a month too, sometimes about hypnosis, but never in a sexual context.

I refuse to talk to tists who want me to be hypnotized the first or second time we talk. I need someone who is patient and understands my concerns. I've had tists say talking to me for a month without ever putting me under is too long, but I think that they don't have my trust then and I won't put any effort into that if they won't. I also have a girlfriend outside of this and any of them that try to encroach on that is a red flag to me. I don't like tists who try to control my other relationships or different parts of my life. I think it's rather easy to weed those out, though there are a lot of them in my experience. As far as actual hypnosis goes, I will immediately block them and leave if they pass any boundaries of mine or try to get me to consent to something while under.

I can't answer this because I don't do text for mostly that reason. I find it incredibly boring...and also, it doesn't work for me because I find reading and typing to be very counter productive to going under.

I frequent SleepyChat occasionally, but I've never found anyone special there. I use the anonymous matchmaking because the chat seems to rarely be related to hypnosis. I set up second sessions through Skype.

I have connected with people online. N and I have been in a long-distance relationship for a while now. A few others I've talked to want to talk to me more after the first few times, specifically because they usually haven't hypnotized me by then. I'm not sure how it usually goes if you get hypnotized the first time.

Hopefully this helped! Feel free to ask more if you want more clarification. "
965," I am a female who is much more experienced at oral sex with women than I am with men. I think oral sex with women is world's easier. I don't know if that's just because I have more experience with it or because I'm a woman myself, but even the first time I did, it was easier than the first time I was with a guy.

I feel like I can just relax and go down on girls. I can just lie on the bed and not move very much. It's almost meditative for me. I know my girlfriend so well that I honestly don't even have to think that much about it, I just close my eyes and enjoy it all.

With guys, I feel like there's so much more movement, I'm constantly trying to get it down far enough without gagging, and my jaw hurts after a short period of time. "

967," Thank you so much! I've been looking for this for nearly an hour trying to find it. This wasn't the exact episode, I was actually looking for Skin and Bones, but thank you again! "
968," I have a Mistress who I've been with for over a year. She introduced me to her friend who, at the time, she didn't have a sexual relationship with. I met him and was instantly attracted to him and she started to fall for him as well. Slowly, he became Master to both of us. 

My Mistress never stopped being my mistress though. She is dominated by him, but she still holds power over me...he just also has ultimate veto power. He is a long distance connection though, so she can physically dominate me while he fucks with my head. 

It's intense, but the amount of love I can feel for two people instead of one is mind blowing...not to mention have those two people fawn over me all of the time. It's wonderful.  "
969, Can definitely vouch for effectiveness. My dom has been training for over a decade though and I was positive it wouldn't work and it definitely does. 
970, Thank you. 
971," How graphic is this? I want to watch it, but if it's like, extremely HD and you can see every little thing being ripped apart, maybe not. "
972, Thank you! This is definitely it. 
973," It was a lot of different things. He's had a ton of experience with it all and I think that's what worked so well for me. He's confident and he knows what he's doing (or at least he sure acts like he does)! I think it also came down to be that I just am really good at being hypnotized. I'm incredibly open to suggestion without being in trance so the amount he's been able to do to me has surpassed even his expectations.

If you ask me more specific questions through PM, I can talk further about it, but I'm not really sure where to begin and what exactly you want to know. "
974," Yes, yes, yes! I am in full support of that decision, haha.
 "
975," Oh my gosh, yes, you should believe it! I think your hair compliments your face so nicely and I can definitely see you rocking the boho thing. "
976," I do not have any advice apart from what everyone else has been saying, but I just wanted to say that you are actually so adorable. Best of luck in finding your perfect style! I find my style seems to change drastically every year or so and the struggle to pin it down, though hard, is so rewarding once I figure out exactly what I like. "
977," Woodstock

I'd love to just take off from my life for a little while and drop acid with hippies. I don't know, just seemed like such an amazing experience. "
978, I'd definitely suggest Mr.Nobody. 
979," It's a strange sort of relationship, complicated to explain but it works for us. I don't call him my boyfriend and neither does my girlfriend. However, we are both physically and emotionally attracted to him and he is to us, so we're kind of all together. His relationship tie is a bit different to us than the one between my girlfriend and I though. "
980," It was someone my girlfriend had been close friends with for 2 years, though purely platonic. She introduced me, we clicked immediately, and we both started becoming more interested in him. It just came really naturally for more to start happening. "
981," It was definitely the point where I was like ""I am obviously actually attracted to males,"" but I think I had entertained the idea and sort of already knew perhaps close to a year before that. I think having the experience gave me the push I needed.

I hate to say this because of course not all women who identify as gay have this problem, but I think I completely shut off all ideas of being with men because of my fear of my father which carried over to most men, especially loud men, but I'm recovering and the person who I had sexual relations with is helping me a lot. "
982," My girlfriend and I would take her with me everywhere since we can't see each other as often as I'd like to.

Oh no, but wait, does it reverse the shrinking as well? "
983," Not in the technical sense. I would say that I have, but others would say that I haven't.

I have had sexual relations with a male. "
984," I guess so, but I still identify myself as gay. I just prefer that to bisexual. "
985," Every since I came out as gay when I was 10, I was 100% gay. I could never see myself being attracted to men or wanting relationships with them. Over time though, that's begun to change and though I think I will always prefer women more, I'd say it's about at 70-30 ratio of preference. "
986," I am fully aware of this. I am only willing to try maybe shrooms or acid, but even that's iffy. I don't enjoy how being drunk feels.

Also, even with edibles, I definitely go out of my way to only do them every couple of months partly because I don't want to become dependent on them and partly because I don't want the experience to get old. "
987," I've smoked weed before a few times, but I really don't enjoy it. I do love edibles though and they really are an amazing experience. I don't do anything else though and even that's not really something that happens often...maybe every couple of months as a treat to myself.

I'm on summer break at the moment, but I am in school. I don't have a job, but plan to get one as soon as I get my liscence that's long overdue. "
988," My parents have both been on and off hard drugs since I was a child. My mother had problems with prescription medications and heroin and my father sold and did meth. We lived with my grandmother for a while, but almost two years ago, my parents got us a cheap apartment. Somehow they managed to keep it regardless of multiple calls to the police because of reports of domestic abuse and ambulance visits because of overdoses. My father works a minimum wage job and sells on the side so rent-wise, it was easy to afford.

They were abusive mostly emotionally, but occasionally physically as well. I always had my door locked and barricaded with my dresser to ensure I wouldn't be hurt. My mother stole everything I owned to sell for drug money and my father condoned it all. 

Basically, my grandmother on my other side (so not the one I was with originally) realized just how bad it was because for some reason, I'd been hiding it and got me out of there as quickly as I could pack. "
989, You will find someone who gives you the love and care you deserve. It is an incredibly strong thing for you to leave when you know this is not good for either one of you. You are a resilient soul and I believe you will make it through this even stronger. Much love. 
990," First question: What is the hottest experience you've had with them? 

I'm really into edging, but not a fan of anything other than self-imposed denial. If I'm with my girlfriend or Master, I want to be able to have an orgasm and not doing so makes me grumpy. By myself, I've gone about a month, but no longer and it was just because I didn't see either one of them for that long and I much prefer cumming with them. So with that, I ask, do your subs ever experience crankiness or just general bad feelings from going so long without orgasm and how do you/they manage it? "
991," Even with a friendship though, I think that hypnosis would be far more rewarding for both parties if a deeper relationship was involved apart from hypnosis. So regardless whether it's a committed relationship or a close friendship, I feel that it's going to be more enjoyable than just meeting someone once and parting. Obviously, that's going to be what's easier to find and I can't even understand sometimes how my tist got so (what he calls) lucky because he often tells me how hard it is to even find females with the intent of hypnotizing them. "
992," I am always the subject and have been hypnotized maybe hundreds of times and almost all of them have been from my long-term hypnotist who got me into this. After reading /u/never_very_serious 's comment, I sort of understand things I didn't before. I've talked to hypnotists through text before, but I am used to be hypnotized through audio so I've only ever done that and every time was lackluster in comparison to my long-term tist.

I believe that those without long-term subjects are definitely not receiving as much, but my tist and I are getting equal amount of enjoyment out of it. I get to be hypnotized by someone who knows every corner of my mind and can give me fantasy-like experiences and he gets a submissive who wants to be on video with him and basically worships the ground he walks on. It is a nice exchange.

So I'm going to say that it simply takes getting lucky and finding that long-term subject to hypnotize. "
993," Yes. My parents are both addicts and I'm rather young and hence, still living with the two of them. I'm finally moving out this summer because I showed my grandmother how bad they were with proof because for so many years of my life, she downplayed all of it. I think she just didn't want to accept that her son had turned out so badly.

But it's ruined so many things for me. They are both violent and aggressive and this has shot my nerves. Loud noises make me almost have a panic attack and I have many weird associations with different things that set me off. Most men who are larger than me (which is nearly all) really need to be extremely calm with me and gentle because I will freak out around them and assume any sort of rough behaviour is going to turn to them hurting me.

I think I've handled it sort of well though. I do well in school and I have a decent support system outside of family. I lack respect for authority and find myself unfairly lashing out at my friends' parents because I'm just so used to having to be the adult with my parents who are children. That's something I need to reel back and I know I do it, but it's so difficult not to think every parent is a piece of shit.

Yeah, this all is terrible. "
994," A lot of them do, I've found. Girl Anachronism is a bit closer to what you're looking for, I think, so definitely give that a shot. Here are a couple other things she's got that give me that same feeling:

The chorus of [Leeds United](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlJ9z_LowBI)

Another song with a bit of a darker sound, but still makes me feel breathless is [Guitar Hero](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a804vFcd_I0)

And she has some more stuff from when she was in Dresden Dolls that's less upbeat, but still personally gives me the same sort of angry, energized, almost crazed feeling, but I'm not quite sure if that's exactly what you're looking for. "
995," I don't know if I necessarily know anything else besides more Amanda Palmer. Runs in the Family is the only song of hers that I can think of that is like that the entire way through, but Astronaut makes me feel that way during the chorus. Maybe some of her older stuff that she did in Dresden Dolls, like Girl Anachronism. "
996," I agree with this partly, that I am now rather bored by the things he posts, but also...he's a person, he's going to change. People's sense of humour changes, the things people enjoy change. You can't expect him to be the same as he was years ago. "
997," I can't promise anything of course, but the first few times I ever had sex and then a few times in recent history when I do new things like hypnosis or something, I hyperventilated. I think it comes for me, with being extremely nervous and extremely turned on at the same time.

I just taught myself to calm down and relax by forcing myself to breathe normally. In the beginning too, we would often take really tiny breaks for me to get some water or something because of a dry mouth, but that definitely will get you out of trance if you aren't used to trancing. I fall back into it easily so that was never an issue for me. "
998," I hope you didn't expect people to take this well. 

I feel bad for her. Hope she finds someone who will actually appreciate her and not take that for granted. "
999," Make sure you breathe through your nose. Sometimes I also find myself nearly panting especially if I'm already rather aroused and it has even caused me to almost hyperventilate before so just make that a point to do. It will start to become easier and something that doesn't require active thought to do after a while.

I expect going under most of the time because I've had the same tist for a while and I can't remember a time when it didn't work, but I think it's best not to have expectations. I mean, when it comes down to it though, hypnosis is not some magical thing, it is definitely your brain doing most of the work whereas the tist is the one working through that medium. You sort of have to expect it to happen for it to happen.

Hope I helped! If you need more specifics, you should ask. "
1000," Hey there!

Do you shave your legs/arms/etc.?

Do you have a typically masculine haircut?

Do you find it's harder to flirt with women or even men because of your crossdressing?

Thanks and much love to you xx "
1001, Bottom of the River by Delta Rae 
1002," Today, my father gave me some money for gas to get to school in the morning instead of giving it to my Nmom. She always takes the money he gives her and spends it on drugs. She doesn't have a job because she's been on painkillers since I was born. 

She was aware that he gave me this money for gas. She came into my room a little while ago and asked me for it. I asked her where she was going and she said ""That's none of your business."" I told her that it was because he told me specifically not to give it to her unless it was to get to school.

She basically starts screaming that I'm worthless and a piece of shit daughter and that she'll get stranded because her tank is barely filled.


Me: So then, why are you going to leave if you know it'll break down?

Her: That's none of your business, but it's your fault if I get stuck.

Me: You're being juvenile.

Her: You're the one being juvenile!

Me: How am I being juvenile?

Her: I never said you were.

Me: You do realize that you're contradicting yourself, right?


She went off in a tangent after this talking about how in the morning she won't take me to school since that's my ""thing now"". I'm not quite sure how going to school is ""my thing"". I just told her I'd call the cops because it's illegal not to take me to school.

I then told her she was being narcissistic and that she needed to get a job so that she'd stop complaining about money and she just goes on and on about how I need to get a job. I'm 16, but I can't drive yet and it's not like she'd take me anyway.

I told her that I was done arguing with her because she is a child who blames her short comings on everyone else. I told her she was ridiculous and that I had better things to do, like study and do homework so I could end up a smarter person than her. She was made furious by this and continued to tell me I am worthless.

I went up to my room while she threw shit around downstairs and screamed at me. I've got adrenaline pumping through me after a confrontation and I'm shaking a lot, but it's okay. I normally cry after stuff like this, but I remained calm and I'm really proud. It kills her not to see me be sucked into her mind games.

I'm getting there. 16 years of this and I'm finally learning how to soldier through it.

Edit: Holy shit, someone gave me gold for this. I never thought I'd be one of those people who would make an edit just to say that, but it feels important for some reason. Thanks for the support, you all! "
1003," I don't even know where to begin. I'm 16 years old and I have a 13 year old brother. My mother is definitely a N, but I just never found a word to attribute to her. I've been living with her my entire life, constantly under her emotional and verbal abuse.

My mother got PTSD after giving birth to me and as a result, began abusing pain medication and heroin. She has been on and off my whole life. When I was 8 years old, I found her trying to overdose. She went to rehab a few years ago, but came back and started again less than 2 days after. 

She doesn't have a job and my father who works minimum wage tries his hardest to support us. You'd think he would have left already, but he loves her furiously. 

She blames everyone for her problem, mostly me. She tells me almost everyday that it's my fault she's like this, that I'm ruining my father's and brother's lives. She tells me I'm worthless. She will say anything to upset me and then will tell me when I begin to cry that I am disgusting and have no reason to be upset. She has told me my father is on drugs (he was before, but has been clean for a while) just to further stoop my mood. 

She'll turn one sentence into a whole slew of things aimed at her. When I finally stop letting her get to me, she'll start to cry and guilt trip me, talking about how she doesn't want to lose her daughter. She steals large amounts of money from me. My father only gives me money for gas and food and such because he'll give it to her and she'll spend it on drugs and act like he never gave her anything. She's even managed to break open a safe and get out hundreds.

She gets mad at me for having to pick me up from school. She acts like it's my fault she has to, as if I can control going to school or not.

It's been getting worse lately. I've resorted to running away to my girlfriend's house when things get bad. I feel terrible for leaving my brother though, but I can't be there. She never notices except once. I expected her to care, but she was too drugged the morning I got back to even notice.

Apologies for this being all over the place. It's still more complex than I've written and too much happens for me to describe it all. I'm just so upset over all of this. I feel so trapped. "
