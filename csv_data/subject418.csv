0, Done :) 
1," Not in this case; the poet's name is  (Su Shi), with  being the surname and  being his given name. Also, just an FYI to the commenter above, his name doesn't really sound like 'sushi'; the 'i' sound is a lot softer, so it sounds like 'sue shih' "
2," its courtesy because youre not spreading your germs to everyone. of course theres dubious proof of whether it actually works, but everyone does it when theyre sick. well, not now though. "
3," [The Shoebox Project](https://shoebox.lomara.org/shoebox-pdf-chapters/) : a fandom classic! Its Remus/Sirius but focuses on all four of the marauders equally. Awesome illustrations to go with the text. Very well written and funny, with moments that will make you cry as well.

linkao3(Astra Inclinant): this fic isnt very well known, but its seriously amazing. Future (non graphic) slash if that bothers you. Its a next gen fic that focuses on Harry, Draco Malfoy, and their respective sons. The quality is really consistent and the author updates every 2-3 months. "
4," Ah, okay. So sorry you lost your bookmarks, good luck with finding new fics to read :D "
5," Im sorry I dont have any recommendations, but are you talking about your bookmarks on AO3 by any chance? AO3s bookmark index is under maintenance for now, so all bookmarks arent currently visible, but theyll be back in a few days! "
6, Maybe [When I Heard at the Close of the Day](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50509/when-i-heard-at-the-close-of-the-day) by Walt Whitman? Theres nature imagery that kind of matches your description 
7, disagree 
8,  
9, Thats just weird 
10," I think the guy above noticed the word ; in simplified Chinese it does means feed, but its more often used as an exclamation in traditional Chinese. The preferred word in traditional Chinese is . "
11, Umm....Hong Kong...? Just because we dont have costcos doesnt mean we dont have supermarkets at all lmao 
12," Not everyone is from the US where Im from, we dont have Walmarts or costcos. Perhaps you might find it a bit redundant or unnecessary, but I think its a pretty nice gesture. "
13," Traditional Chinese is used in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, while simplified Chinese is used in Mainland China. Traditional Chinese characters are basically ancient and retain their full meanings, so if youre looking for more symbolism, traditional Chinese would be the better choice "
14, Im Chinese and I think its hilarious 
15, Username checks out 
16," I know, Im from Hong Kong haha. Just pointing it out because lot of people dont seem to know that China has its own version of Wikipedia, albeit heavily censored "
17," Chinese people use Baidu Baike, which is kind of similar to Wikipedia. "
18," Mostly English, although its not my mother tongue. I guess its because I mostly enjoy media in English and Im more used to the nuances of the language "
19, I have a spaniel. He looks like a red panda with those weird dots over his eyes 
20,  :) 
21, Stick googly eyes on all of their photos/paintings. 
22, Thank you so much :D 
23," Im sorry if this isnt allowed. 

How do I get this background? Ive tried looking at the love Nikki wiki galleries, but I cant find this background (or the suit it belongs to). Please help? This is the Taiwan/Hong Kong server, if thats of any relevance "
24,  
25," Hey, Ill be honest the jokes really arent that funny. Some of them have potential, such as the teachers hair one, but it isnt written clearly enough. Bear in mind that while juvenile humour can be funny, it needs to be in small doses. Overdoing it just makes it weird, and frankly quite cringey. 

I spot a lot of run on sentences (and just plain long sentences). Remember to vary sentence lengths and insert more punctuation. There are other major issues like spelling errors and incorrect tenses, which Im sure you can correct. 

The characters are fine enough, but theyre not really distinguishable. There are some weird descriptions why is there white liquid dripping from John Ngs arm? I understand that you wrote this for comedic purposes, but theres no real point to inserting random things like that. 

I think you certainly have a unique setting, but youll need to clean up your draft a lot. "
26," Sorry, I dont have much time, so I only read a bit of it. 


Your writing style is good enough. The dialogue is fine, though it could be a bit more natural. 
Ive noticed that you tend to use the same sentence structure when describing an environment. Try to vary your sentence structures more? "
27, $69 for one bottle? You gotta be kidding me 
28, heres a hug (**)

30, Close! Hong Kong 
31, Worlds most expensive city and highest property prices  
32, Data. 
33," As an aspiring artist, I feel you! 

Practice helps a lot. Copy people in photos, objects, go out and draw your local neighbourhood. This will eventually build up your drawing skills. If youre short on time, even five minutes a day will pay off in the long run.

Know that its okay if you mess up this time. You havent wasted any time working on your current project, youve only trained yourself and subconsciously improved. As long as you know what youre realistically aiming for,  you can always try again in the future when you feel that youve become more skilled. Good luck, Im sure that itll turn out great!  "
34, Trying to sit on my dog as if I was riding a horse when I was 2  
35," Zenobia, queen of the Palmyrene Empire. She was a warrior and well educated, fluent in several languages. After her husband was murdered, she became regent of her son.

44, I really like the effect! Looks magical  
45," Joanna Newsoms album, Divers, is the same begins with the word  sending and ends with trans-, creating the word transcending when you loop the album. "

54," The batch on the left is coffee, the batch on the right is milk and honey. We had a bit of a problem with the fragrance but it turned out fine in the end :) "
55,  
56," Can anyone link to a source? Searching formaldehyde shark only returns news about the shark going viral online but nothing about the tank being broken 
 "
57, Jesus Christ thats horrible. 
58," I havent read YA in a while, but Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe is one of my favourites.  "
59," Words that sound like... well, sounds. For example buzz, boom, and pop "
60," Dumb as fuck, but kinda cute. "

69, i saw the title and was immediately reminded of sufjan  
70," Swedish, I think "
71, Done 
72, no shame in that. Those books are great 
73," I didnt save the link; I dont want to see it again lol. I think I found it by typing mp4 (random date) into the search bar, because someone said pedophiles lurk around webcam videos uploaded by kids who forget to change the title of their video. I was just curious to see if it was real, and got that instead. So please, dont try that out. "
74, The number of professors at Hogwarts. Surely their schedules would clash if there were only one professor for each subject. 
75, Found a video of a girl being raped on YouTube  
76, During the middle of an exam  
77, oof 
78," happy cake day! I find that nosleep has dropped in quality recently, but occasionally there are still some good stories. "
79," This is a common Reddit sentiment. 
I dont hate facebook, its just not useful for me. All of my peers have migrated to other platforms. And personally speaking, I wouldnt like anyone selling my data, so... "
80," An old man helping his (presumably) grandson pee into a plastic bottle at a restaurant, then putting the bottle into his bag "
81," Reddit is forum-based and anonymous, so its definitely different from other social media sites. Cant say if its better though. "
82, Procrastinate 
83, Can someone tell me why Ive been seeing so many reposts from the top talent subreddit and this particular user? Nice art btw. 
84," [The Light Rail line](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Rail_(MTR)), serves a part of Hong Kong (New Territories) that is more spread out than the rest of the city. Source: am hongkonger  "
85," Butterflies. I just hate flying insects in general, no idea why. "
86, thank you! but for some reason it says doesnt ship to Hong Kong... huh. 
87, thank you! 
88," okay, thank you so much for the tips! "
89," Thanks for the tip! Ill just try to look around for cheap stick blenders, I guess :( "
90," I live in Hong Kong, we dont have Walmart :( The cheapest I can find in this local chain store is 50usd "
91," thank you for the in-depth answer! 

Ive heard that splashing might be an issue. Do you know of any possible solutions? Im ruling out using a whisk as were probably making multiple batches. Unfortunately, there arent much thrift stores near my area, so Ill have to rule out that option too. "
92," Hi, Im thinking of trying out soap making for a school project. I dont have a stick blender on hand. Will a regular hand mixer work? "
93," I love all dogs, but Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, because I have one. "
94, Im from Hong Kong too! her handwriting is adorable! 
95," Exactly my sentiment. I live in Hong Kong, where people dont usually tip unless theyre eating at a luxury restaurant/have actually received excellent service. All workers get a reasonable minimum wage they can live on. Im not against tipping, which is great when you want to show your appreciation, but making it compulsory is hard on both the customers and the workers. Tipping has become more of a necessity than an act of gratitude. "
96," Im not too sure about the lomo instant, but [this site](https://instantcamerablog.com/comparisons/instax-mini-9-vs-70/) can probably help you with comparing the mini 9 and mini 70! "
97, There was this reddit comment that said typing a random date into YouTube would get you videos whose file names hadnt been changed. I tried it out of curiosity and found a video of a girl being raped... never again. 
98, Tipping 
99," I was riding my bike at night with my friend. Saw a slope and thought it would be fun to ride down it, so we did. Fell down and dragged my chin against the concrete, hurt like hell and I looked like Id been attacked by a feral cat. We were stupid kids "
100, M 
101, Replying with this to someone elses comment when you have nothing to say.

106, Deleting Chrome tabs after finishing an assignment. Pure euphoria 
107, We read excerpts of Anne Franks diary in sixth grade English class (Hong Kong). Hong Kong was not really involved in the Holocaust so we were only taught an overview of the war and how kids coped. Sorry if this doesnt help much.  
108, You need to stop looking down upon other people. 
109, Before I enter another room to do something else. I forget everything as soon as I reach the doorway.

111," Its okay, I appreciate that youre being so polite :) Have a nice day!  "
112," Japanese uses kanji, yes, but in a different way. Speakers of the language are able to differentiate. The characters on the package are , which means I like you. AFAIK, the same expression in Japanese does not use these characters. "
