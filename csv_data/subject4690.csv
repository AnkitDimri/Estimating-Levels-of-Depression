3, Im a massive fan of internal trade routes purely for extra production 
4," Worcestershire, Evesham in particular, has a larger claim to being the Shire over the other counties because:

a) the axis you described (from the Black Country to Malverns and Wye Valley) lies almost entirely in Worcestershire.

b) Pipe-weed from the Shire in the books corresponds to tobacco cultivation in Evesham (Worcs)

c) Tolkeins maternal family were based in Evesham..... "

7, This film was such a mindfuck which is why im struggling to remember key details. I think its fairly recent (within last 2-3 years) 
8," Cannot remember the key details which is why Im on here.
It starts with a guy getting convinced by a friend to go to some retreat. This ends up being a warehouse where the first room he enters is a guys rally.
Another room he goes into is a dark aquatic-ish room with the sound of the sea and a set of chairs. Two other people in the room start getting it on.
One room is like a weird sit down therapy session off this weird wooden corridor.
He kinda goes mad and ends up back in the first room but shouting at everyone.
The film ends with him back home with all this merchandise from the company that owns this weird retreat. "
9, This actually happens in the UK on bonfire night 
10," No, Tolkein based the shire on Worcestershire "
11, Reality TV production does involve making a lot of open ended decisions as you cannot predict what will happen. Richard is effectively a pawn for production because hes not able to win. I imagine if everyone arguing too much they would have tasked him to do something more stabilising. 
12, Neither of those pairings compares to any from last season imo 
13, I know Richard was planned from the start. im talking about the recent plot to make him an adverse player. hes the only one making the show entertaining imo and its like production are trying to compensate for the lack of drama. 
14, Obviously richard was planned to go in from the start. but im talking about the recent plot to make him an adverse player. 
15," The fact that production had to get Judy (Richard) to stir the pot in order to get blocked indicates that even they know that these contestants are getting on too well....

Edit: by saying to get Richard to stir the pot, I dont mean by his inclusion in the circle (which was obviously planned from the start). I mean the recent narrative to make Judy an adverse/hostile contestant. "

18," I saw a post about this a few weeks ago and Im really disappointed that they havent fixed this in the recent update! Its such a deterrent to liberating cities if your units are then scattered after doing it. Why is it so hard for them to do auto-open borders after liberating?!

35,  
36," Im not disputing that what you say are valid pro-remain arguments. Im saying you are actively ignoring what people would consider pro-brexit arguments.

They are out there if you vary your news sources a bit though I get the feeling that you wouldnt want to hear them anyway. Even what you said about Boris, some would consider him being PM a great thing (albeit not who I would want).

Its fine that youre being stubborn but dont pretend that youre not. "
37, the stubborness that you accuse brexiteers of is exactly what you are displaying 
38," i do believe politics matters. But people who voted for brexit believe it was the right thing... similar to how those who voted remain believe it is the right thing. There is evidence (and speculation) to support both remain and leave. Yes, idealised views and zealous ideology do muddy the waters, however, you add to that mud in the water yourself with your anger and your absolute belief that youre right and everyone who disagrees is wrong. "
39," It seems youre the one who wants an echo chamber. Most people are fine knowing someone has voted differently to them however, it seems you feel that aggressive confrontation is necessary when seeing someone who has a different opinion to you. Perhaps you should seek some therapy or anger management if someone disagreeing with you politically is such an enraging trigger... "
40, yes really! They have not said anything hurtful or insulting. All they have done is voiced an opinion in an objective inoffensive way. And the fact that you see that as a cue to call someone a cunt (along with those upvotes) sums up what this sub is all about.

43, ALL THE COMMENTS HERE ARE DESCRIBING REAL LIFE 
44, this is job shaming 
45, Finally.... This has been what Ive been trying to say all along: People have different opinions. 
46," Regions being left behind is irrelevant to the question of the EU. Unfortunately, it has more to do with economics rather than politics and revitalising regions is very costly if there is economic pressure against it. Furthermore, youre assumption that I vote based on balancing UK regions is completely misguided. I dont believe governments are capable of balancing regions, especially with so much economic forces against it.

I dont know where you get this idea that I believe in an empire.... If anything, voting to leave the EU surely is a vote against what seems to be a proto-EU Empire.

I know exactly what my government has done and Id vote for them again (if they Brexit properly). The tax breaks have been great and a look forward to more! "
47," Its not hypocrisy. I prefer the UK system because I believe it to be more democratic than the EU system. Furthermore, it is more local than the EU therefore it considers UK interests more so than the EU.

If I could have a referendum on the House of Lords, or further devolution, then that would be great. However, the referendum was about the EU.

You should read up about the commission before attacking me considering that it is a fundamental part of my argument.

Better yet, you dont have to attack me at all. Just accept that I dont want to be in the EU.... the same way that I accept that remainers want to be in the EU. "
48, isnt everyone getting 2 points the same as everyone getting 0 points??? 
49," What has the House of Lords got to do with the EU commission being undemocratic? What-about-ery doesnt go against my argument about the EU commission.

Yes the House of Lords is an undemocratic institution based largely on appointed members. However, it does not preside over the commons. Whereas the appointed institution of the EU commission presides over the EU parliament...

Furthermore, youre taking the argument to an EU administration versus UK administration where Id always prefer the UK because it prioritises the interests of the UK, irregardless of how the system works (even though I do believe it to be more democratic than the EU system). "
50," I disagree, at least the cabinet and executive in the UK are part of the parliament.... unlike the EU "
51," actually, by youre own definition im correct. If democracy is citizens voting, then the EU commission is undemocratic! "
52," clearly everyone has their own definition of what is and isnt democratic. They have elections in North Korea but I dont see anyone calling them democratic.

Also, it sounds to me that youre the one that wants to start an argument. All I did was reply to OP and people had a problem with some of the words I used. I dont believe anything I said was inaccurate and arguing over wording does not make my views or opinion any less valid.

The worst part of this is that I have not tried to de-validate any remain views however, it seems some remainers on here are just so bewildered that someone would not want to be in the EU that theyre willing to start arguments over wording.... "
53," I guess its a matter of opinion. The way I analyse it, is based on the purpose of the commission. The EU parliament acts as an elective buffer between the public and the commission which for me reduces the grade of democracy or grade of mandate or w/e. Without the commission I believe the EU would be more democratic. Which is why I call the commission undemocratic. "
54," its undemocratic because theres no public mandate on which the commission is appointed despite its considerably higher level of power in comparison to the parliament. In the UK, the executive and cabinet are part of the parliament rather than a separate body, this makes them more accountable to the public. "
55," If only! I wouldnt be opposed to the EU if it were just a multilateral trade deal (which it used to be). The ever increasing breadth of EU powers over national governments is something Id rather not be in. However, I do understand why others would want that.... I just wish some remainers would accept that not everyone wants an ever closer union. "
56," The Commission. And although the parliament is elected, they have limited powers... some of which youd expect a parliament to have. The structure is designed to allow for legislation to actually happen as I would imagine that without a commission and with increased powers to the parliament (which is far too Huge to function solely) then nothing would be achieved. I accept that for it to work then it comes at a cost to how democratic it is... which is why I fear its potential for tyranny. "
57,"  vastly different comparisons. US food standards are not as prohibitive as common agri/fisheries policies and are nothing to be scared of. Nonetheless this is a matter of opinion, which is why Im struggling to understand why youre so insistent to tell me Im wrong. "
58, common agri policy and common fisheries policy is an example. 
59, im not confused about sovereignty. Youre just making an argument about it because youre assuming my initial argument was about being sovereign in the most extreme sense. I know what I meant by when I said sovereign - to clarify - is that legislative powers moved back to the UK parliament. At no point did I say this to be economic isolation. 
60," Its unnecessary to start namecalling when ive explained to you what I meant. Again, youre twisting words. I have no obligation to put things using the terms of your choosing. In fact, ive used the terms Merkel and Macron used. Whether you believe it to be loaded or not is youre own issue.

And no, Im happy with the UK in NATO. Its further EU integration Im against. "
61," Youre putting words in my mouth. I said EU army as a quick way of describing further defence integration (which i imagine will result in some joint forces in the distant future). I brought it up because Nick Clegg and some other remainers during the campaign were adamant that this would not happen... when it it really will. My argument had nothing to do with what the EU army looks like.

Again, people in this thread seem to misunderstand the fundamental difference between leave and remain. Its whether you want further integration or not. And personally I dont want further integration of defence, even if you believe it makes sense or not.

Twisting my words or putting words into my mouth means youre not addressing my point, but rather turning my point into something that it isnt and then arguing against it.

My point was never about what the EU army would look like. "
62," Its impossible to say if it would be similar to NATO or if it would be more centralised. Its still a discussion at the EU council. Merkel has expressed something more centralised than NATO which makes me uncomfortable. However, my overall point when mentioning this was not about what I would look like, but more about the fact that Nick Clegg some other remain campaigners were adamant that further defence integration would not exist when it looks like it will... "
63, just google it. this was late 2018 
64," its been widely reported that Merkel and Macron have called for it. I accept that this doesnt make it a certainty but it does make it an agenda. Personally, makes me very uncomfortable. "
65, im not arguing for economic independence as I have never seen that as a reality. Again youre making the argument about the definition of sovereignty and I told you that economic independence was not part of my argument or why I wanted to leave the EU. Youre conflating ones desire to be out of the EU with the desire to be completely economically independent. Those are two different things. 
66, I had to way it up. I was originally a remainer but after seeing how the EU operates I could not with any sincerity support it. 
67," In my post, sovereignty does not mean economic independence. You cant label your own definition of sovereignty as fact when fundamentally its legislative independence.

As for the power plants I am actually for them. I have nothing against trade arrangements and cooperation.  I am uncomfortable with some of EUs undemocratic institutions and its aim for further integration. "
68," I support Brexit and I guess its because of something weird. 
I fear tyranny and the way the EU institutions are structured allow for a less democratic and more authoritarian ways of legislating. Further integration of EU member states will, overtime, result in more and more transfer of power from National Level to EU level.

The pro-remain arguments to counter this point have been denial about further power transfer (e.g. Nick Clegg denying there will be an EU Army), however, it seems that an EU army is on the agenda and that EU bureaucrats want to speed up the transfer of powers so it becomes easier to fight growing euro-scepticism across Europe.

My vote was purely based on sovereignty over anything else. I just wish the remainers would at least respect that not everyone votes for economic reasons... "
69," you seem pretty hostile. i didnt say anything about not wanting you to reply. However, you wrongly assumed that I was demanding a reply. Whether you replied or not wasnt something I had an opinion on. "
70," no. i didnt. no-one did.
chill. theres no need for hostility. "
71, no-ones asking you to say anything. Chill. 
72, ya but the unpopular opinion does include a caveat  regarding original material so not quite off topic. 
73, Mary Queen of Scots film should be considered fiction seeing as the storyline is so far removed from reality. 
74," First of all research is not conclusive on what exactly causes homosexuality.

I need to point out that genetics arent always as simple as just inheriting what your parents are.... well it is that essentially but within the set of genes you inherit (your genotype)  theres combinations and hierarchies involved to determine what and who you are to the world (phenotype). However, you can still pass on whatever genes are in your genotype... So even if there was a gay gene, then there is a chance it would skip generations (like ginger hair).

Furthermore, being gay does not stop you from reproducing. "
75, TBH the difference between very cute and very creepy is if youre into him or not. 
76," yes, because it was hilarious how a non-EU member state hosted it this year.... "
77," Seeing one was fine. It was interesting. And seeing an unusual one can be somewhat interesting - For example someone who earns income entirely from their (re)investments or perhaps someone who lives in Middle Earth or Wakanda.

Most of us dont and seeing one personal income/expenditure Sankey is enough.

However, this has not stopped the fortnightly post of some persons income and expenditure organised in a rainbow appearing at the top of data focused subreddits (e.g. r/dataisbeautiful).

Now, dont get me wrong, do enjoy a Sankey diagram however, there are millions of more interesting topics than publishing your own personal finances. "
78, theres no difference between a northern irish teacher and a drill instructor 
79," That I have to have the same political views. For example, in the US theres this expectation that you have to support the Democrats if youre gay and that supporting Republican is some sort of heresy. "
80, yes and no. depends on the person.

82, finasteride 
83," the tory Brexit squad are scared because they will lose votes to the Brexit party and UKIP (like they did in the last european elections). Theyre not concerned about these elections somehow getting in the way of Brexit.

I dont know how remain is going to benefit from these elections. whilst the pro-Brexit parties are trying to tear each other apart youre forgetting that theres proportional representation and were (albeit by a slim majority) a pro-Leave country. If anything this means that pro-leave supporters will have more options of who to vote for without worrying about splitting the vote (unlike in FPTP).

Furthermore, euro-scepticism has been on the rise in other EU countries so I expect these elections will be very messy and in no way support pro-EU causes. "

91,  
92, this was my coming out story.... 
93," that is in most cases however, XM state that they waive the swap fee without increasing the spread or commission. "
94, Im not hating. I think shariah-compliant accounts should be open to everyone regardless of religion. 
95," its better because XMs islamic accounts literally have lower costs. Unlike other brokers, they havent re-engineered the swap fees into another form of cost. All they have done is removed swap fees while keeping spreads and commission the same.

Edit: grammar "
96," actually youve missed my point on this. Im not disputing the existence of shariah-compliant accounts. Im disputing that they should be Muslim-only accounts. What would be legal is if non-muslims were allowed to have shariah-compliant accounts. For example, islamic banks allow non-muslim clients.  "
97," Ive seen that a few brokers (e.g. XM) offer shariah-compliant accounts that are more advantageous than the standard accounts (they waive swap fees without increasing spreads or commission).  However, they require you to prove you are muslim...

I dont know about laws in other countries but XMs UK based operations are regulated by the FCA meaning that it needs to comply with the law. Most notably the Equality Act 2010 which states its illegal to discriminate against clients based on their religious beliefs.

Ive reported this to the FCA as one should be allowed to open shariah-compliant accounts regardless of religious beliefs. However, I noticed that other brokers who are under FCA regulations who also illegally discriminate based on religious beliefs.

Im curious to here if this has been an issue for anyone else or if this has been raised in the past?


Edit: please do not misinterpret what I am saying.
I am not disputing the existence of shariah-compliant accounts. I am saying that shariah-compliant accounts should be open to non-muslims. For example shariah-compliant bank accounts are open to non-muslims and legally brokers should follow. "

109, i have my food delivered so I have one less reason to go outside 
110, no. it has to actually look edible not just resemble the shape. this looks like mdf. 
111," yes you a right. i misphrased what I meant. Modern building techniques allowed for stations to be more basement-like as opposed to tunnels. 

An architect is best for figuring out what to do with all that extra space. (architects cant do much with the narrow tunnels seen in stations like oxford circus or covent garden). Thus why these stations have distinct interiors.

Its relevant because Waterloo and LBridge are the only ones in the extension that dont do this (Southwark is basement-like for the majority of the station). Perhaps theres a mixture of reasons for this?

(i know the picture is of a tunnel-like part, but the aesthetic was determined by an architect because of the extra space because of improved construction tech) "
112," a lot of them were built around the same time during the Jubilee Line extension from Westminster to Stratford.

different architect firms were selected to do each station (not just engineers) and hence why the stations have better designs and larger interiors as opposed to the tunnel-like design found in most stations (though with every new redesign these are gradually being phased out like with the current Tottenham Court Road redesign).

The extension had one lead architect (Roland Paoletti) to impose some consistency of the design thus why precast concrete and polished metal panels make up baseline aesthetic of each station. 

Precast concrete and metal was a popular choice of aesthetic during the late 90s (when the extension was done) for high-order architecture. This is why it still looks futuristic as it takes a while for the latest styles to filter down to large scale low-order commercial/residential architecture (cheap architecture). For example, full height single pane windows are still popular today (particularly in large-scale apartment developments) however, this was first done in 1929!

Stay productive and active and keep pushing forward and youll start to see yourself progress into someone more accomplished and the self-loathing will lessen. 
134," if youre a skilled trader then you can make it all again. This time take chunks of money out on occasion and save it or put it in low risk investments (like bonds). I trade myself and Ive lost it all several times but ive always had contingency cash stashed in order to live off and to restart.

Edit: You may find that in the long term that the wealth you build will be from the cash you stash away. "
135," Stop taking recreational drugs (including weed and alcohol), just stick with the drugs that are prescribed to you. Set yourself targets that arent social or recreational goals but productive ones (e.g. this can range from career advancement, getting fitter, building a shelf, or learning a language). Be sure to make sure theyre achievable and within a timescale that you can work with. And commit to them. This may come at a cost to your social life but it seems thats the problem at the moment. Changing this (whether temporary or permanent) may help.

I used to be emotionally dependent on my social life and took recreational drugs (because im more fun and popular when taking them) but overall I was sad inside. Someone gave me similar advice and although Im not as sociable or popular or outgoing anymore, Im definitely happier. Im more accomplished, im more comfortable with myself, and its made me closer to my family and people I trust. "
136," In my games ive found myself razing about 60% of cities. at the start Ill mostly keep cities but after you have around 7 cities you should only keep cities if they have amenity advantages. Keeping used to help with taking more but Ive found that the new loyalty mechanism has somewhat made it harder since the cities captured rebel while youre still trying to capture opponents cities. Razing stops this from happening and it makes keeping the odd city easier due to the reduction of opponent loyalty.

Also keeping every city will mess with amenities enough so to hinder production and potentially cause rebellion in your more established cities... "
137, you can always raze cities. 
138," its supposed to cover the joint between the wall and the floor.

140," Nah, Winston, like Rockstar, was easy to wind up.  "
141," one of the main ones is road damage, for example on the east-west streets the shadow from buildings may result in half the road getting maximum exposure and the other half getting none. This can cause road deformities. Its only when buildings are tall enough to limit overall exposure when this becomes less of a problem.

Another one is ice - the diagonal grid allows for a more even exposure to the sun which can prevent ice patches remaining the streets during the day.

south facing houses on the north side of an east-west road are unfortunately positioned. Their front rooms may get too much sun resulting in issues with glare and overheating. And the house casts a shadow on their back yard where youd ideally want a lot of sun. Buildings that are built at a diagonal orientation get a more even distribution of sunlight amongst spaces and less areas of extremes however, this can only be realistically done with a diagonal grid.

Its all about evening out exposure and reducing the areas of minimum/maximum exposure. In the north-south east west grid these are located down the lengths of streets. In a diagonal grid, these are limited to being at junctions. "
142," no. diagonal results in more even sunlight distribution.

north-south east-west, although easier to read on a map results in extreme differences in sunlight distribution which causes long-term problems.  "
143," the difference is sunlight. its more evenly distributed when grids are orientated diagonally.
when its orientated north-south east-west it results in extreme differences in sunlight distribution which can cause a multitude of complications. 

Edit: Grammar "
144, the evil one is the one who decided to do north-south east-west grids. Diagonal is better.

Edit: Furthermore, Faroe Islands should also have (Denmark) like Greenland. "
196, She's doesn't speak on behalf of London or British queens! It annoyed me that she tried to justify her crap lipsync by claiming britishness. She's not really British tbh and I hate how she hijacks the British brand when really she's just an anglophile stuck in her own idealised views.

Edit: by ""same as sugar"" i mean same calories as sugar and not that it is bagged the same as sugar.
