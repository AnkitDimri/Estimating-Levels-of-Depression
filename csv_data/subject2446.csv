0," There is a dutch junior (not old enough for the international scene yet though) who has the same kind of  toe point, it is amazing to watch! "
1, Only a doctor can tell you wether you have POTS or not 
2," The 2y/o is thriving (for now), and he isnt in the hospital "
3," Repost because I accidentally made it a live chat discussion. 

I was wondering if I could just ask my Casio fx-CG20 to calculate limits for me (so I can check my answers on a test). Is there such a possibility? "
4," Yes, you are one of the exceptions. It is unreal to expect you to do work that only trained staff can. 
However a lot of people in SNF's do not have dementia and do not need 24/7 care "
5," Do you have EDS?

I bruise very easily but I have EDS as well so it makes sense for me. I haven't heard of it as a standalone issue though "
6," Oh, i hope it doesn't bother you too much and that you can get it under control soon "
7," Yes, very happy about that indeed. I assume yours went away too? "
8," Oh okay! Yeah, I also have hEDS with a lot of dislocations in my shoulders. I slept with my arm above my head one night and woke up with a lot of pain tge next morning, which turned out to be tendinitis. There was a good explanation for me having it too. "
9," No, my infection levels in my blood (I was tested for CRP) were too low for it to be bacterial (it was 12 while bacterial is more than 100) so antibiotics wouldnt have had any effect. "
10," Yes, i loved gymnastics (hence the reddit name). I really miss it. Coaching gymnastics too, but I might be able to pick that up again sometime.

Also walking stairs without feeling my heart beat and shopping without having to recover from it "
11, Puppy tax? 
12," I was 'diagnosed' with POTS and hyperventilation at the same time. The doctors there said that that combo indicated anxiety, so I was diagnosed with anxiety as well. One visit to a psychologist later and it was very clear I did not have anxiety disorder.

Maybe try keeping a packet of info about POTS with you so first responders can know what they are talking about? "
13," EMS are simply not trained for these kinds of situations. For what they know, anxiety is closest to what you are experiencing. That does not mean you have anxiety.

Sorry you had to go through all of that. "
14," The deviation of point P is given by u=1,81 cos (24pi * t-3.25).

Algebraicly, calculate the speed of P in t=0. Give your answer in km/h and complete with one decimal point. "
15, I just tried finding it but I can't find it anymore. I guess I dreamt reading it in that case (I have a hard time telling if dreams are reality or not) 
16," Ik dacht thuisarts or rutgers, maar ik kan het niet meer vinden "
17, User flairs 
18, User flairs 
19, I had it for 3 years and while it was fun it was quite useless lol 
20," I'm also 17. Also I am Dutch so I get what you mean by hausartz, the correct english name would be GP (general practitioner), PCP (primary care physician) or family doctor. I have found GP is more an UK term while GP is american. Family doctor seems to be in both. 

It is very possible the surgery will not work, I know just hypermobility in more than one shoulder disqualified me from having that same surgery, at least according to my orthopedic doctor (I tore my capsule and damaged my nerves one after the other).

For fitness, physio is excellent. EDS joints work different than normal joints though. A regular physical therapist gave me exercises that made my dislocations worse unfortunately. You need one who can work with you.

In terms of other sports, I do swimming. I love it and (depending on the stroke) it is very light on the joints. I also have POTS though so other sports are not really possible for me.

Good luck! "
21," Please don't beat yourself up. I got hEDS from my mom, she has a much milder case than I have though. She has beaten herself up a long time. It is not necessary. Genetics is a lottery and your daughter happened to get the wrong ticket. It was 50/50 wether she would get it or not.

Now go spoil her a bit, first times are always scary. I think she will appreciate a hug from her mom. "
22," Okay, thank you for informing me. I source I thought was reputable said that it disappeared after labour. Guess my source was wrong "
23," Yes, that is what I was wondering too. I know the Dutch rules (I am dutch) "
24, My last name is multiple words (think something like van der waal). Do I just count waal (4 letters) or do I count van der waal (10 letters)? 
25," I have a little note in my phone and a bigger one with the same text in my school bag. It says (Translated to English):

**I have POTS**

In postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), heartrate and circulation are not working properly. I need a seat right away to prevent fainting. Please give me the room I need to sit or lay down if necessary. "
26," So I've had gougerot-carteaud syndrome  (also called confluent and reticulate papillomatosis) since I was 4. I'm in a huge flareup right now of it, so I went to my GP today.

He said he thought there might be a connection between hEDS and GC, which is why I am curious. Anyone on here who has both too? "
27," RICE is my go to: rest, ice, compression, elevation. If your body tolerates it, a pain killer could bring down the pain and an NSAID might help if there is any inflammation, but I can't tell if there is from your description. 

I hope it heals soon! "
28, This is something I read on the most reliable doctor site of the Netherlands (the one the GP recommends you look on to see if you should get into the office a lot). I did not know it was inaccurate. Thank you for letting me know. 
29," Kill him first, home alone style "
30," EDIT: Don't listen to this comment, I was misinformed. 

The only time a hymen can disappear is after giving birth in a natural way "
31, Can confirm was 16 until 2 weeks ago. Still feel like baby 
32, Not insane 
33," Kids are obnoxious sometimes, theyre KIDS. Any adult that doesnt get that should not get to care for kids.

Good for you for breaking the cycle "
34, Class 2 is often recommended (that's 23-32 mmHg). I don't personally use them but I know a lot of people that benefit from it greatly! 
35," Underage smoking/drinking seems to be going away. It is still there, but not to the extent my parents experienced it "
36," Yes, but the trend I have noticed is that you cannot have speed and quality at the same time. At least in my opinion, quality should be more important than quantity when it comes to homework "
37," Seriously, the ability to properly explain something/have something explained, as well as the ability to read back answers you have gotten when you want to prepare for a test, is totally gone. In my opinion, live discussion adds nothing to this sub, it just takes away its greatness "
38," Congratulations!

It is a very double feeling indeed, but now you can get the help you need hopefully. Good luck in life! "
39," Ooh, thats a good one! Thanks! "
40, Obsessing over someone 
41," I had a low grade fever for 4 weeks a while back. They said infection too, since my CRP was raised and I fainted from low HR once, but no other symptoms either.

I also had tendinitis at the same time, but nobody knows wether it was related or not. The fever just disappeared one day to the next. It was really odd "
42, hEDS has no genetic test so that is why I was wondering 
43," We are just going to start at the first term, x^(5). If we want to divide this by x+8, we want to factor out x+8 from x^5. As you can see that is not possible, so we are going to do it a bit different. We want to write it in the form of a(x+8)-b, with b=8a. Can you see why we would want that?

B in this case will be something like cx^(4), which you can then add or subtract to the next term.

Dont forget that (a+b)/c is the same as a/c + b/c

I will fully work it out for you, please send me a message if you dont get anything or if you would like the workout "
44," What type was your sister diagnosed with?

It is possible, your muscles might be tight and I am not up to date on beighton scores for the other subtypes "
45," Thank you so much!

We have decided to not let him roam around the room for a few days since a lot of jumping is involved in that.

Our vet told us to bring some of his own pellets/hay so I assume they won't let him go until he eats.

He is very picky so we haven't found any veggies he likes yet, but I think we will spoil him a little more with banana and dried coconut in the first week, he loves those "
46, Another commenter gave advice that worked so luckily i cannot lol 
47," Thank you, it worked. Helped "
48, So I have the task to remove some batteries from a portable lamp. They are stuck very tightly. How am I supposed to get them out? 
49," My mom who is also hypermobile (possibly hEDS, just no official diagnosis but it seems unlikely its not) had a super quick labor too, about 2 hours from first contraction to me being born but only 20 minutes of pushing. "
50," My rabbit does tend to imitate our cat indeed sometimes. Cat will sit in front of cage, rabbit sits the same way. Cat yawns, rabbit yawns. Cat lays down, rabbit lays down.

Its cute "
51," You can have POTS without EDS.

I do have flares that can last from a few hours to a few weeks. Even in good periods, I still have symptoms.

I cant even ride in a car normally, no rollercoasters for me. Although I couldnt ride them before getting sick either. "
52," Oh okay, i am not a native english speaker so I sometimes miss those little nuances. Thank you for clarifying.

To be totally clear from my side too (I feel like I didnt express this enough in my previous post, sorry for that), I totally agree with your perspective and I believe my dad his abuse contributed to me growing up faster, just more indirectly than in your case since the abuse was not focused to me. I was taking care of my mom on my own most days, with help from my grandparents when possible (they lived an hour away so they would only come when it was really bad). My dad just refused to do it (both taking care of my mom ans taking care of the house) and he just really resented her (and since this year me too) for being chronically ill and needing care. In his words: if you two would just be productive members of society, it would be different. You are at home anyways, why should I do anything? "
53," Yes, in my mind 'they're just a bit busy' would mean 'the restaurant just is a bit busy' since we are obviously not the only guests getting served by said waiter.

I'll try but it is hard, especially since there is no equivalent to most of your pronouns in my native language. In my native language, the translation would be 'it's just a bit busy' "
54," Can confirm, in others as well "
55," People saying their pronouns are them/they is very confusing as a non-native speaker.

Them or they implies multiple people. 'it' would be a lot better. Or do they actually think they are more than 1 person? Seems unlikely to me. "
56," For me it started when I was about 5

I was always called the mature kid. I definitely had an Ndad, but he never abused me as bad when I was young, mostly my mom. I only got abused when I wasn't dependent on him anymore (around age 11).

My mom has a handicap, and I think that made me grow up fastest. She already had it before I was born. I knew from the start that life wasn't fair.

Please don't assume that every mature kid was abused. Although it might be true for a lot, it is not for all.

Interesting observation though "
57," Yes! It was a bummer that I didnt get to the next round, I had 22 points and needed 23 so I was very, very close "
58," Okay, thanks!

Our vet told us fasting was unnecessary and that we should bring in some of his own food. So I guess we are good there.

We will ask the vet about a cone, I hadnt thought about that.

We will keep an eye on him.

Thank you for the information! "
59," Also don't forget to replenish your calcium and magnesium! Not sure if they contribute to what you are feeling now, but they are important electrolytes nonetheless that are often not in sports drinks or other solutions "
60," Try drinking more divided over the day. So instead of downing 500ml in one sitting, try 2 times 250 ml in 2 sittings 30 to 45 minutes apart "
61, Thank you! 
62," So I have a test this coming Thursday in which I will have to write an essay with a certain structure (intro, 2 arguments pro, 1 argument con plus refutation and outro).

I have practiced writing a few essays but I do not know what the theorem we have to write about will be.

What are your best tips for a kick ass essay about an unknown subject? "
63," Okay, thank you! I googled critical care and all I could find were minor programs for nurse majors

Our vet practice has a rabbit vet, a cat vet and a dog vet (with a little crossover in between if one of them is sick) so they have a lot of expertise for all animals (we have a cat too). We are lucky to have them. We will ask about the critical care! I assume we will get a lot of this info at drop-off too but I rather be overprepared than under prepared "
64," I got top 10% of my country in the math olympiad last year and 1st in my school. It felt great, especially since until 11th grade math was my worst subject. 

Only top 8% went to regionals unfortunately, and I have aged out this year. But it was a very fun thing to do! "
65," Yes, total cost = total variable cost+ total fixed cost.

The fixed cost is 40 (which is fixed so it stays the same no matter the value of q) and the variable cost is given to you. You simply add 40 to the variable cost "
66, That's stoptober for ya 
67," Thanks so much, you are always so helpful! 

They did mention pain killers were included in the price so I think we are all good there.

I am not in the US, what is critical care? "
68, Our rabbit will be neutered in 2 weeks (november 18th). Any tips on how to prepare/care for him before/after? 
69," This is not the correct way to tape, it can cut off circulation. Taping never goes all the way around "
70," I was worried about the same stuff.

When I went i realized everyone was feeling the same way. There was nothing to be afraid of, since we were all afraid of it.

Good luck "
71," Okay, thank you! I've taped my ankle before and I agree that taping should be done very carefully so I think I am going to go with a mix of tape and bandage so nothing can go wrong with it "
72, Okay thanks! 
73," Thanks! I'm thinking a combo of tape and bandage will be the way to go. Drug stores are closed, so a splint won't do unfortunately "
74, Was there a specific technique he/she used? 
75," Would making something similar with a bandage have the same effect? The drug store just closed, i didnt realize I would need something to stabilize it until very recently unfortunately "
76," We can't exactly tell you that, just know that if this is the flu or a cold, it is normal for us to react more severe. If it is a cold or a flu, the hospital can't do anything. They're virusses, not bacteria.

I would go if it lasts for more than 10 days but I tend to be on the conservative side. Some hospitals have a non-emergency line, maybe ask them when you should come in. "
77, Thanks for sharing. Made me tear up a little 
78," So yesterday I stood up from a chair and felt (and heard) a loud knack in my wrist. Just feeling my wrist/hand, it was quite clear my lunate bone subluxed. I was able to get it back in place, and most of the tingling was gone very fast.

I've been resting it since then, and it has slipped out a few times since but not as bad as the first time. Usually I would rest a few more days, but I have a test tomorrow. That means writing (on paper) for 2 hours straight. Of course the injured wrist is my right, aka my dominant wrist. I can write a little with my left, but not nearly good enough to have it be readable after 2 hours of writing. 

It is too late to ask for accomodations, so that won't help. I can't reschedule the test either sadly. 

I am really scared it will slip out again during the test, and really want to prevent that. What would be the best course of action to stabilize it while still maintaining function in my hand? "
79," Tbh if both sides are ok with it, there is no problem with an 11 yo and 15yo hanging out.

However if both sides dont enjoy it, you should not be forced to. You should not be forced to hang out with anyone, no matter their age. NTA "
80, You have snow?? He must be so happy about that! 
81," They factored out the 2 (see the denominator too, 2*9 turns into just 9) and took the negativity out of the square root (sqrt (-17)= sqrt (-1 * 17)= sqrt (-1) * sqrt (17)= i sqrt (17)) all in one step "
82," Off topic, but try putting them on over your hips to get them on easier. For off, first get your arms out so your arms are still besides your body, then take it off over your head.

Putting it on/off that way has significantly reduced pain for me "
83, Insane 
84," Knees locked back, hips tilted the wrong way. Reading the other responses this seems like the normal way to stand almost "
85," Totally agree!

I want to add one thing that helped me a lot too: keep a routine. Do the same things every day. For example, my days are always structured like get up - take meds - rest - schoolwork (swimming on wensday) - rest - lunch - rest - activity (schoolwork on wensday) - rest - dinner - rest - activity - bed. Just keeping my days roughly the same really helps my body to calm down, since I always know what I will be going at a certain time "
86, No problem! 
87," First find the derivative of the function.

When there is a maximum, the derviative equals 0. 

You also know the derivative at x=-1

Then you fill in the point

Ill work it out too, let me know when you solve it. "
88," Yeah, if you arent wrong im in big trouble too I guess. Any drink other than plain water makes me nauseous so I kind of cannot switch to other drinks lol.

They did tell me my morning urine did have to have some sort of color (very light yellow was OK) now that I think about it, but mine always does so im not worried about that.

The explanation of your doctor makes sense too though "
89, Where did you read clear urine is bad? Ive had clear urine for months now and none of my doctors seemed to be concerned about it... 
90, Thank you! 
91," Okay, will try. Thanks! "
92," Okay, thanks! We do keep trying veggies but it hasnt taken yet. We have now started hay with herbs, as our vet recommended, so he still gets all his nutrients.

Fresh fruits are not a hit either, but he only gets one piece of fruit a day at the most (usually more like 2 or 3 a week) and theyre small, not bigger than a post stamp.

He is a real chewer by the way, won't the stuffing in the animal be dangerous for him? He has several chewing toys and they all break really fast. "
93," We have been bonding (being on the floor together) since we got him in July together but while he just jumps on my lap and lets me pet him, he barely seems interested in my mom. Would bonding just the 2 of them work better? 

Unfortunately we haven't found any veggies he likes, but my mom often feeds him some other snacks he likes (dried bananas and coconut, he is a picky eater) 

He is around 5 months now and we have been planning on getting him fixed too, guess we have to speed up that process a little. "
94," Okay, we will get that done asap then "
95," Okay, thank you! We will get him fixed ASAP "
96," Okay, thanks! It's just so strange since we did all the bonding together but ever since the beginning he was drawn more to me. Sniffling my mom but jumping on my lap. We will get him fixed asap, and I'll let them bond alone from time to time too "
97, Congratulations! 
98," POTS is a syndrome in which the blood vessels of the legs do not constrict enough to counteract gravity when standing or sitting. This causes the blood to get stuck in the lower extremities, leaving less for the head and heart (and in some cases, other internal organs). All impacted organs get less oxygen, and they do not like that. This can cause all sorts of problems, which is why POTS is such a broad diagnosis.

Family can help by just being there for her. Make sure she has enough access to salt and water at all times. We have been led to believe salt is bad for us, and in general it is not the best. However for POTS patients it is key. 

Also help her find a good doctor. Not all doctors know about POTS, and some that do are still misinformed and say it is caused by anxiety/stress/depression. It is not (although it is sometimes comorbid) and treating it like a mental illness will not do this any good. It is incredibly frustrating to not be taken seriously. 

Also, SHE IS NOT TOO YOUNG TO HAVE IT! I have been told this by multiple doctors on multiple occasions. She is not too young for medications, or compression garments, or whatever. 

I would also recommend finding a physical therapist who can help her increase her exercise (cardio and leg muslces are often recommended)

Her future can look like a lot. First off, we do not know where on the spectrum your sister is. She could live a relatively normal life, she might even grow over it (doesnt happen a lot, but it does sometimes when it started during or right before puberty). On the other hand, she might also get worse and end up bed-bound. You can speculate, but you simply do not know.

They are making a lot of progress with medicine too, so maybe in the future there will be a cure. For now all they can do is attacking the symptoms. Often-used medications are beta-blockers like propanolol, vasoconstrictors like midodrine or other, non classified drugs such as mestinon or florinef. However first-line treatment is more salt, more water, more exercise and getting to know your boundaries.

Good luck to your family. "
99," Not yet, he only turned old enough very recently so we plan on doing that very soon. Could that be the problem? "
100," So this morning my mom went and fed our rabbit. I usually do this, but couldnt this morning. When she wanted to grab his bowl to put food in his bowl, he bit her. It left a little wound, no blood. My mom is now very afraid that it will happen again.

The rabbit is more drawn to me in general. He has not sat on my moms lap even once, while he uses me as his personal play castle. He growls towards my mom when she comes to talk to him, while he has never done that to me.

Could it be that the rabbit just doesnt like my mom? If so, how do we fix it? He was originally her birthday present so I feel really bad sometimes that he is almost my rabbit now, but i dont know how to change that. "
101," Also, in America she might speak English and Spanish fluent. In other countries, it's the native language and English. "
102," Damn, that almost made me cry too.

People like that only make it harder for all that really have something. I also talk openly about it but not for attention; I just want people to understand that I can't help it if I can't do something they consider normal.

I've had to give up all the fun things in life, most things that make me normal. I do not enjoy it. That does not mean I don't get to talk about it. "
103," Its 2 scrolls for me, I hope it is the same for everyone else too! "
104," NTA, that was a very age appropriate way to explain mental health "
105," No, my hands and feet always feel cold to me. Occasionaly my hands break out in sweats but theyre still cold to me. They are normal to others at that time though. "
106," That sounds amazing.

I was undiagnosed from march to june with a very debilitating disease and the thing that bothered me most in that time were people who said the passive aggressive things like oh im tired too sometimes, you are too young to be so sick, well you look fine to me. So please dont repeat those things "
107," NTA. This does not sound like a safe situation, especially when you are not 100% commited to it (which is OK) "
108," Totally agree. 

One thing strikes me as odd though. I am not from the US so I use our Halloween-like holiday (kids sing a song instead of saying trick or treat and don't dress up but they make their own lanterns) but I know all of the kids that come to our door. Is it common in the US to go trick and treating to other people than your neighbors? "
109," Oh my, that sucks! "
110," Strange, we are having no problems. We are just in expert league though "
111, I have some irritated nerves in my shoulder right now which makes the experience so much weirder too. I don't think there's a good way to describe either of the tingling to someone who hasn't experienced it 
112, A 7 year old vs 12 year old are totally different situations though 
113," Yes, it's a very strange experience. They get very cold too "
114, Math teacher. A high school and bachelor's degree away 
115," NEVER dismiss their struggles. If you are undiagnosed for a long time, people start to think you are making it up. Please don't be one of those persons. Be supportive to your friend and partner, even if their struggles seem unreal. "
116, Those cost money 
117, Congrats man! 
118," Talk to a professional. Depending on where you are that could be a school counselor, a trusted teacher or a therapist. You do not have to do this alone, people can help you!

Good luck "
119," Probably yes. They get picked up to go to the vet too, and they forgive us for that.

Seems like you totally got your bonding going great, enjoy it! "

123," 15,0 grams contains 0,357 moles

Now you need the molar mass. The molar mass is calculated by mass in grams/amount of moles. 

Then you need the molar weight of C an H, 12,01 and 1,008 respectively.

You also know the ratio between C and H, for each molecule of C there are 2 molecules of H

You bascially need to solve 12,01x+2 * 1,008x=15/0,357. Solve for x

Final answer:

!x=3, your answer is C! "
124," Lol, i was trying a comeback. I started homeschooling this school year (12th grade), it is impossible to notice I am homeschooled from 3 months of homeschooling. "
125, How can you tell I am homeschooled? 
126, Can you be more specific? Without knowing what info you have we cant answer your question 
127, Physically tired and mentally tired are not the same. Are you tired of thinking or are you tired of exercise/movement?

144," Agreed, pillows suck "
145," I am so sorry you had to go through that. Bawl all you want, you deserve it. Nobody should be treated that way.

Some doctors just have a god complex and do not want to admit they do not know something. It really sucks for the patients, who become victims of these assholes. "
146," Well the S in PCOS stands for syndrome, which implies it is different in everyone. Syndromes a set of symptoms, you do not need all symptoms to have the syndrome "
147," No it's quite the opposite of slippery luckily. There is some foam in there so a jump on there vs normal floor does give you a little more power, but by far not as much as the spring floor does "
148," Well, he isnt wrong if the change is a decrease.

Sucks that he wont cooperate though... "
149," Yes, we have both of those! The red and yellow ones are amazing! The red ones with the white sides decieve you a little, I've gotten huge carpet burns from them when falling (we have them in small as well as really large format, so the large ones were often used as landing mats for vault) "
150, We have a light blue floor with dark blue sting mats. Other mats are all either red or yellow and red. I love the yellow and red mats! 
151," He said he was suprised the patient did not faint and I got the advice to limit sitting and standing so that would not happen either a little later. This was posted after I got the letter from my doctor, but before discussing treatment options.

There was no blood taken during the test, so I am not sure what type I have. I have low BP though so i think its hypovolemic? But not entirely sure on that. I did get prescribed mestinon which I later read was is hyperadregenic POTS. "
152," I have the same thing with high-salt foods. I need 12g of salt as a minimum a day according to my doctor, and it's a struggle to get that in "
153," I always keep my knee slightly bend when walking stairs too, i have hyperextended that sucker a bit too often on the stairs.

I had no idea this was a common thing, you learn something new every day I guess "
154," As far as I know it is not normal to always walk up the stairs tiptoed, just when you are in a hurry and kind of running up the stairs (just like when you walk you use your entire foot, when you sprint you only use the ball of your foot). 

The pain when you do not walk up the stairs tiptoed (I don't know if you have that too) is not normal. 

It is such an automated thing for me to just go on my toes real quick that I don't notice. My mom told me her observations a while ago and ever since I'm like 'yes, she's right' "
155," Try factoring out 6 out of 24v-12. You can only cross out something on top and the bottom if there is a multiplication of both. I'm going to give the answer in hints, try using the least amount of hints you possibly can. 

!*try finding 6(av+b) for the top. Leave the bottom as it is.!

!6(4v-2)=24v-12!

!you can now divide both the numerator and the denominator by 6!

!((6(4v-2))/6)/(6/6)!

!(a/a)=1, a*1=a!

!(4v-2)/1!

!(a/1)=a!

!final answer: 4v-2! "
156," Do you mean (24v-12)/6, 24v-(12/6) or something else completely? "
157," Not an adult (17 years) but I often walk on my tiptoes without noticing. I just thought that was the muscle memory from gymnastics kicking in though.

Walking stairs without being on my tippy toes is almost impossible for me though, if I do that it feels like my knees can explode at any moment. Never related it to EDS "
158," They stay up until November 4th I think, we are on day 6 now! "
159," Trees and bushes make me far more, far quicker. Just those saws and axes lol "
160," Is she on medication for it?

Medication and finding my 'trigger foods' (mostly fat foods or foods with a lot of fibers) and eating smaller/more often meals has really helped me with the constant nausea.

 I was never diagnosed with gastroperesis but I did have symptoms of it, I am just kind of doctor-tired and I can manage it this way without a diagnosis too. "
161," Have you been tested for POTS? If your complaints get worse after standing or sitting up for a prolonged amount of time, it could be a real possibility

Doctors are often not able to diagnose it (my process was quite quick with 'only' 5 doctors but 21% of POTS patients sees more than 10 doctors before diagnosis)

EDIT: I specified it to POTS, but it could be another form of dysautonomia too. Not saying you have it, its just worth checking out if it isn't already "
162," Totally agreed. I also feel like people don't always understand that our worries have a reason, and that worrying isn't really in our personality. "
163," I don't think a healthy person who has never encountered sickness like this fully understands what it is. 

I think that's the reason why communities like these are so active, everyone is going through the same thing (and there are not a lot of people in real life that do). "
164," That's a very common thing for me to do, yes. I often drink more than that too (again, medical issues) "
165,  
166," Yes he will, I agree with all of that too. I just believe that medicine isnt cut and dry and that stuff happens to people. My combination of complaints is not something you encounter a lot (diseases with a rarity of 0,3%, 2%, 0,4% and an unknown percentage) and fluid retention is a real thing in what I suffer from. If you dont want to believe that, that is fine. Like I said before, fluid retention on its own wont make you obese either. If you are already overweight it might just tip you over the obese line though. 

I have no idea what venmo is and I do not need money, I just want to show you that weight gain is not always as cut and dry as you make it seem. More factors come into play. Each factor on their own might not make you obese, but if you put a lot of those factors together it can.

I guess we will just have to agree to disagree. Adios, amigo. "
167, Yet I will believe my doctor over someone on the internet 
168," As I responded to you before, I was told by my doctors that this was fluid retention, NOT gained from food. "
169," Yes, i know it is not possible through food. Since it was gone the next day, i was told by doctors it was fluid retention. "
170,  
171," I know it from my own experience. One day I was 62kg, the next day I was 67kg. Then the next I was 64kg again. It fluctuates like crazy. 

5kg of water is 5L of water, which is totally not impossible. I drink that daily, more most of the days (on doctors orders, again I am hypotensive most likely due to hypovolemia. I need that water to somewhat function). I ate normally, and food has fluids in it too

If you dont want to believe me thats OK. I just wanted to say that there might be reasons someone is struggling with weight (which I am not, 62 and 67 are both very healthy weights for my height) that are beyond what you can see. I might be an execption to the rule, but I surely am not the other one "
172," That is one way of factoring. In this problem, since the top and bottom both have -1+1 you dont need to factor that out. The first step you are doing is totally legal in the laws of math.

In this problem, you can factor out m out of m^(2)+m and m-m^(2), getting yourself m(m+1) and m(1-m) respectievely. Now you have a multiplication on top and on the bottom, giving you a legal reason to cross out m. "
173, Bad bot 
174," The correct way to show it would be to factor out m though. Your method works for now, but it might not work for future problems. Get in the habit of rewriting expressions now "
175," Yes, I do know all of this. I am just saying that fluids can get you up quite some weight. Not to obese levels, but just my fluid retention can make me up to 5kg heavier one day to the next. And I am only on a very low dose of a fluid retentioner (severe hypotension so they are trying to up my blood volume with fluid retention).

Also, the gym in my username refers to gymnastics (I still like a workout, but I am not a bodybuilder or whatever) "
176, I hope you saw my edit in time 
177," It's what I get too indeed. Good job

EDIT : I misread. mL*L amounts to mL*1000mL so it is 1000mL^(2) "
178," X*y^(-1)=x/y

(a/b)/(c/d)=(a/b)*(d/c)=(ad/bc)

Those are all the rules you need.

First take out all the powers, then make one fraction out of the numerator/denominator. Then use the second rule.

EDIT: I just worked out the problem. You will need some more rules.

1mL=10^(-3)L "
179, Congratulations! How old are you turning? 
180, Oh my yep. Guess we will see when the first competition videos/pictures start rolling around 
181," True, but that does not validate them "
182," Not true. Some medications have you hold more fluids thus gain weight.

Fat is not the only part that makes up weight "
183," It's not that I am tired of open backs, I am just tired of gyms (not one in specific) ignoring and finding loopholes in the rules USAG sets. "
184, Ugh. Id hate for them to get away with it. I dont think open lower backs should be allowed either and this one clearly has an at least somewhat open back 
185," that is not the correct derivative.


The correct derivative is !((-6)/(px^(3/2)))+1! "

192," The only stress I ever experienced was with our previous cat who got diabetes and needed insulin shots twice a day at set times, and nobody around us who was willing to do it for us. Also he got stressed from vet visits (which were frequent) which made me stressed. But he was of course an  exception, not a rule.

Even with our current cat who loves to go on walks and asks for walks is not stressful. He comes when he wants attention and won't let you come close when he doesn't. "

198," My PT knows about hEDS and has never dismissed my feelings. I'm very glad to have her.

I did get tendinitis in my shoulder about 4 weeks ago but it didn't really hurt anymore so I assumed that healed and had nothing to do with it. Maybe I was wrong though "
199, I wouldn't be surprised either (I sublux while walking or sitting regularly) but it just felt different. It is certainly a possibility though 
200," First off I am not looking for medical advice, just experiences. I have an appointment with my PT Monday so I will bring this up to her too and follow her advice. 

I heavily subluxed my shoulder this past tuesday, with heavy I mean it took some force to get it back. It didn't feel like a full dislocation though.

It felt like it was back in, so I didn't do anything about it (no RICE, which is what I usually do after a heavy sublux or a full dislocation, since it usually hurts and RICE relieves that a bit)

This evening I hugged my mom, and my shoulder made a loud clicking/popping noise. My hand feels very light and tingles a bit, my outer upper arm and shoulder are all swollen. This leads me to believe my shoulder has been out of place since Tuesday (from tuesday until the click it all felt the exact same).

The strange thing is, my mom (who is a nurse) checked my shoulder on Tuesday and it felt like it was in place. Appearantly it wasn't but it is still a strange thing. 

Has anyone else ever had this happen? "
201, It's such a double feeling for sure. Congratulations and good luck on your journey forward!

In most cases, it is true that the derivative at an extrema equals 0, right? That is how we were taught in algebra. But then we have never studied derivatives of absolute values "
210," I got tendinitis from sleeping the other night.

Sleeping might be the most dangerous activity out there for us.

Sorry you are going through all that... "
211," I have not experienced this but i have heard a lot of stories. Do not play the i looked online card. Those 3 words seem to make a doctor not take you serious immediately.

For now, just try to relax. It is all going to be fine. This is not the only doctor in the world. You just gotta find the right one. That does not mean you need to find a doctor that will give you an EDS diagnosis because you ask for it, that indicates a bad doctor to me. You have to find a doctor where you feel comfortable and who is willing to look beyond your current diagnosis and look further than the common options.

Good luck! "

!The vertex form is f(x)=n(x-h)^(2)+k with the vertex at (h,k)!

EDIT: just looked back at the picture and holy moly it seems very small. In reality it's 3 by 4.5 feet so not as small as the picture may indicate "
230," First off, set all the rules doing with this problem in a row. (step 1)

set tan(x)tan(y) in terms of cos(x)cos(y) and sin(x)sin(y). You have a fraction. Set it equal to 2 (since we know tan(x)tan(y) =2. Now cross multiply. You have an expression with cosine and sine. (step 2)

Now expand cos (x-y) using the difference formula. Again, you have an expression with cosine and sine. (step 3)

Now you can start your substitution. Use what you found with the tangens to sub into the difference formula. This gets you the vaule of sin(x)sin(y) and the value of cos(x)cos(y). (step 4a and 4b)

Finally, use the sum formula to expand cos(x+y) and substitute in the values you found in step 4a and 4b (step 5). Now you have your answer.

Here is my answer if you want to check yourself: https://imgur.com/gallery/gcbYzTA

If you have any questions, please ask. This problem was quite a puzzle "
231,  
232," Alternatively, you also know 3 points. (0,0), (30,-30) and (60,0). Now you can set up a system of equations using 3 variables by filling in the x and y values. Multiple ways, same answer "
233," You know the vertex (30, -30). The vertex form is f(x)=n(x-h)^(2)+k where (h, k) is the vertex. This means that f(x)=n(x-30)^(2)-30. Working this out (since you need standard form) gives f(x) =nx^(2)-60nx+900n-30.

Now we get to our second point (60,0) filling this in for x and y, we get 0=n* 60^(2)-60n *60+900n-30. Solving for n gives us n=1/30.

Now in our worked out vertex form, you can see there is only one term with x^(2) so for this problem we can say n=a "
234," This exercise could come straight from an economics textbook. Here are some defintions you need to know:

Total cost=fixed costs+variable costs

Marginal revenue is the derivative of the total revenue

Marginal cost is the derivative of the total cost

Break-even: total cost=total revenue

Maximum revenue: marginal revenue=0

Maximum profit: marginal revenue=marginal costs

Can you solve it now? "
235, It's the joint capsule then. Thank you for helping me figure out the correct term 
236," EDIT: i use the term capsula but I just realized that's probably not the real English name (maybe it is, English is not my native language). The capsula refers to the thing around the joint that is filled with fluid to assist in moving

So my shoulders have been subluxing as long as I can remember. It never was really a problem, until this past December. I did gymnastics at the time and right as I went into an element, my shoulder subluxed and I put weight on the subluxed joint. Result: a ruptured capsula. You don't see anything anymore except 2 small scars with fluid, presumably where the rupture was. All pain is gone, swelling is down and mobility is back. 

Ever since, my shoulders have been a lot less stable though. I never really related those 2, but after nearly fully dislocating tonight it just came to me that that was the moment my shoulders got very unstable.

I do my studying in the morning while laying down. Fatigue is lowest in the morning, brain fog is least while laying down.

As to medication, I just started mestinon and my doctor said it usually helps brain fog and fatigue so that might be something. My dose is too low to really comment on it tho. "
248," Same exact story here. Neurologist diagnosed me. Since my brain MRI was clean, no followups. I am now treated by an amazing cardiologist.

To OP, I dont think it matters as long as they are willing to treat it and know about it (or want to learn) "
249," I think there is an image missing here, what does x refer to? "
250," Sure. I will do problem number 3.

522 is what is remaining of your non-rotten, non-donated oranges. 

The first clue we have been given if we see the problem backwards is that remaining oranges minus those donated equals 522. In percentages, 100%-75%=522. This means that 522 is 25% of your oranges that were donated to charity. Your total donated to charity was 522*(100/25)=2088.

Now we know that 13% of all oranges were rotten. Those that were not rotten, account for the 2088. Applying the same logic as in our previous step, we can say that 2088 equates to 87%. We now know the total number of oranges in the beginning is 2088*(100/87)=2400

Is this clear? "
251," Solving these problems backwards is usually easiest.

For number 3. 75% of non rotten goes to charity, how many were non-rotten in total then? How many was the actual total?

For number 4. First find how much money she had for clothing and the remain, then try to find the actual total.

If you have any questions please ask "

My PT massaged it and I've been using heat on it. I can go about life again without a sling now, but it still hurts so I'm going to be reading for some suggestions too. "
256," Still, water doesn't taste bad. It tastes like nothing. If you don't like that, add some fruit, veggies or herbs to your water.

257," I am revising for an exam and I cannot wrap my head around the following problem. Also I am dutch, so I wrote it out

**For a certain buisness, the following is given:**

**Price=110**

**Total variable cost=10q**

**Total constant cost=1000**

**The capacity equals a quantity of 100. If this buisness wants maximum profit, which of the following is true?**

**A. Cost price of 10, revenue of 11.000 and profit of 10.000**

**B. Cost price of 20, revenue of 11.000 and profit of 9.000**

**C. Cost price of 20, revenue of 10.000 and profit of 10.000**

**D. Cost price of 20, revenue of 11.000 and profit of 10.000**

We were taught that for maximum profit, you should set the derivative of total cost and the derivative of total revenue as the same, but it doesn't work with this problem. "
258," POTS comes in various degrees, it is a syndrome after all. Don't dismiss your own struggles because others have it different or worse "

263," I am going to explain 8 for now, try and figure out the rest on your own first.

From the top description, you can see DG=DE and GH=EF.

Since they are similar triangles, the ratios are the same. We can now say that DE/DG=EF/GH

These values are all known. You can fill them in. (91/52)=((2x-1)/(x+3))

You can solve this with cross multiplication. 91(x+3)=52(2x-1). This means that 104x-52=91x+273. Simplifying gives 13x=325 so x=25.

304," Im on domperidone for nausea since before I had my POTS diagnosis actually. We only recently found out that might help with orthostatic intolerance (it does not help OI for me), but I will keep using that because it helps immensely with nausea as long as I watch what I eat.

This is the first medication I am getting for the POTS tho.

Was mestinon the first thing you tried? How long did it take for the side effects to go away? "
305," Oh thats a little misunderstanding. I am starting with 20 mg a day (10 in the morning, 10 in the evening) for 2 weeks, them in week 3 upping to 30mg, week 4 40mg, week 5 50 mg, week 6 60mg and if it is necessary we should continue that way. This is to minimize side effects. I have an appointment to discuss progress after week 3 though, so until that time (and I know how long it works) I will stick with 2 times a day. 

I really hope it works, but I know that if it does not that there is more for me to try. Still very nervous though! "
306," If that happens often, try placing parentheses around the part that has to be integrated. I used to do that at first too, but not anymore.

Good luck! "

322," You have a small (s), medium (m) and large (l) bottle. Try rewriting your clues with these variables.

For example, the small bottle contains 6 ounces less than the medium bottle. So s=m-6 "
323," Lets say our equation is f(x)=square root ((5x+5)/(4x+8)). 

A square root cannot be negative, so (5x+5)/(4x+8) should be greater than 0. That means that either 5x+50 and 4x+80 or 5x+50 and 4x+80 (since negatives cancel each other out). This gives x-1 and x-2 or x-1 and x-2. Since -2 is smaller than -1, your solutions are [negative infinty, -2] and [-1, infinity]

You also cannot divide by 0, so 4x+8/=0. This means that 4x/=-8 and x/=-2. You can see that -2 is still in our solution set, so we need to use different brackets to indicate that. The bracket you use when something is not in the set is , but larger (so the opening is as big as that of a regular bracket). For simplicity, I used a )

Final solution: Df=[-infinty,-2) and [-1, infinty]

Now you have a system of equations. Solve for H to get your answer

!equation 1:E=50-H. Substitute into equation 2 to get 30(50-H)+60H=1950. Working away the parentheses gives 1500-30H+60H=1950. This gives 1500+30H=1950 so 30H=450. Divide both sides by 30 to get H=15! "

To get all confusion out of the way, I will use p for your first problem instead of k. They have 2 different values, so it is easier to use 2 different variables.

First you foil

2x^(2)-5x-52=2x^(2)+8x-px-4p

Then you get all equal terms together, you simplify

Px+4p=13x+52

Factor out p

P(x+4)=13x+52

Now, factor out (x+4) out of your right side

P(x+4)=13(x+4)

Divide both sides by (x+4)

P=13 "

374," Totally true, dr. Visser as well. I knew it was normal, just not how much was normal. I did not faint, but then I got the mild version (first to 20 degrees for 10 minutes then to 70 degrees for 10 minutes) because I am only 16.

I still have the follow up appointment on phone this coming wednesday, we just recieved the letter he sent to the GP and it said this. I will ask on the phone if the reduced sitting and standing he recommended is actually necessary, my PT already advised against it.

Did he give you the advice to have short periods of standing/sitting with longer recovery periods of laying?

Also, do you speak dutch? If so, maybe we could just talk in dutch (I am fine with English too but for the medical terms dutch might be easier) "
375," I will probably start either medication or compression stockings this wensday! Because I am only 16 I do know the doctor wants to take it slow and try one thing at a time for now.

I was actually diagnosed this past june (without tilt table but still) too but my diagnosing doctor wasnt willing to treat it at all so I had to get the tilt table after all "
376," I do that sometimes too.

Literal translation (I am dutch, so the rapport was in dutch) of part of the rapport says a tilt to 20 degrees gave significant symptoms and an important decrease in cerebral bloodflow (-30%). With the tilt-through to 70 degrees symptoms increased. Since it was a relatively good day for the patient there was no syncope. Like even the doctor was suprised I did not faint.

His advice was laying down a lot with only limited time spent sitting and standing, thus I thought the numbers might be concerning high. "
377," When I was 1 year old, my cat had to get neutured so we brought him to the vet. Being the little kid that I was, I obviously had to go with my mom to the vet. I asked my mom where the cat was going. My mom had no idea how to explain to a 1 year old what neuturing is, so she told me he was going to cat school.

I proceeded to have a long conversation with my cat about how he had to be a nice cat to the teacher and the other cats. My mom heard me have this conversation.

A few months ago my other cat had to go to the vet to get an abcess removed (I am almost 17 now). I walked in, and I realized that this was the room that I once called 'cat school'. 

Cat school was the vet office. My mom confirmed that she indeed told me that cat number one went to 'school' but he went to get neutured.

Nobody ever believes I remember something from when I was a year old, even though I have a witness to back me up "
378," I wish. I am not in an English speaking country, homeschooling is illegal here. My options are to finish regular high school with accomodations or to drop out (my plan is to go to college after high school, which can be done through online schooling if I need it, so dropping out is not an option) 

My high school is super accomodating though. I have unlimited absences, emailing adresses of all teachers (and a phone number for 2 of them) and I get to spread out 12th grade over 2 years (I will take a year longer to graduate but I skipped a grade in elementary school, so it all balances out). Testing is in the morning (least brain fog) in a room where I am alone and can do what I want (sit, walk, lay down). No complaints about school at all.

Thank you for thinking with me though! Again, I wish it was a possibility but it is not. "
379," The doctor gave me the advice to lay down as much as possible, which is why I assumed my numbers might be high. There was significant blood pooling (my lower and upper legs and arms turned blue), I was just wondering if more people had numbers like I do "
380, Thank you a lot! Movie nights (or movie afternoons in our case) are a very good idea. We occasionally play board games and wii board games but after 1 game we are both very tired 
381," We just got the results back from my tilt table test. During the test, they used an echo machine to measure cerebral bloodflow. I had a reduction of 30% at a 20 degree angle and 37% at 70 degrees.

This seems like, well, a lot of reduction. Is this actually a lot of reduction or is this in line with what other POTS patients have? Is it dangerous?

I will talk to my doctor on Wednesday and ask the same questions (we just got back the letter they also sent to the GP), but I really do not want to wait so I hope yall can help me ease the mind a little "

386," My dad is the narcissistic asshole in the family who denies I am as sick as I am. It is one of the reasons my mom is divorcing him (he always was somewhat emotionally abusive, but since I got sick it took a turn for the worst).

She is such a great mom which is why I hate to see her like this, she has so much struggles on her own too. 

I do have a psychologist who says I deal with it very appropriately, my mom is going to ask for a referral to a therapist or someone else who can help her this week.

I think I am going to write her a letter telling her how amazing she is. That way every time she gets herself for it, she has something to go back to. 

Thank you for your advice, I hope you are doing somewhat OK now "
387," Amazing advice. She is a great mom indeed. 

Another commenter recommended a letter, I think that is the best course of action. That way she has something to go back to when she is feeling down. "
388," Thank you for your kind words. She is going to seek a therapist in the coming week.

My dad doesn't actually believe I am sick, plus my parents are going through a nasty divorce right now ( my dad basically refuses to speak to my mom and vice versa).

I am sorry it had so much impact on you. I never saw it in the light of 'its OK I am suffering' but you are right, that is basically what is happening. 

One other commenter suggested writing a letter, I think that is an excellent compromise between not saying anything and supporting her. "
389," Yes, I've saw a psychologist once so far (my hospital does this for all chronically sick kids as a precaution)  but she also told me I am dealing with it in a healthy manner. I do have some appointments standing but I am not sure those will still happen (I will hear at my next appointment)

We are not in an English speaking country so we need a referral to a therapist, I did convince my mom to go ask for one at our GP and she will do that this week (she is also going through divorce and was emotionally abused by my dad for years, so this is not the only reason for her to seek therapy. Just the circumstances are getting too much for her to handle) "
390," Yes, my mom is very supportive and never doubted me one minute (my dad is another story, but that is for another time). 

Most of the time my mom is happy I am here, but sometimes during a rough day it comes out that she does not want me to go through this.

I just love my mom to death and its so hard to see her struggling which in my opinion is not worth the struggle. Like you said genetics is a lottery and I got the bad ticket (probably not the worst ticket though, I have so far not inherited her MS) "
391," That might be a good idea! I am starting medication for my POTS /ME/CVS soon, so I hope I will be able to do more things then.

It's just that our good days never seem to line up (my mom has MS), so it would probably have to be in our house.

Do you have any ideas? "
392," That's an amazing idea! I think that's what I am going to do. Thanks for chiming in as a mom too, it is great to hear a different perspective. 

 She does have EDS (probably), she is at least hypermobile but by far not as bad as I have it (she has never dislocated, for example). She has other issues though (MS) "
393," Yes, she is an amazing role model! She turns that into a negative from time to time too, that I had to grow up faster because she is disabled. I absolutely don't see it that way and I was a kid for long enough. Maybe that's just part of motherhood. 

I will remind her more though! "
394," That's a great mindset! I do always make the best of it (or at least I try to) but seeing me down sometimes probably doesn't help (not that I will be less down now, I am still processing this whole being chronically ill thing).

I'm not sure activism is the right thing for my mom, but I might be able to get her into a hobby so she has some distraction "
395, Oh yeah I didn't think about that. I will be careful. Thank you 
396, Thanks for the suggestion! We are not from an English country though (my mom her English sucks) and there is no translation to our native language unfortunately 
397," Yeah, we are hoping to get a referral to a therapist for her. She is not religious so that is one thing she is not willing to do (we still respect all religions, we just don't choose to actively participate in any). I am very glad she is seeking help though. 

I think she might have been struggling with this for a while, but my parents are going through divorce too (my dad is a narcissistic asshole and he does not deal with me being sick to tell a long story in a short way), so life has been very hard on her and it just comes out now with a lot of tears and sadness and it kills me to see that. "
398, Thank you for the support. I definitely have been hugging a little (maybe a little more than a little) more since I realized she was struggling with this. 
399," Thanks for the insight! The doctor did mention measuring glucose levels, but didn't really go in depth. We are getting exact results back on Wednesday tho, so I will inform a bit more then "
400," That is what I am trying too. Genetics is just a lottery. My mom is hypermobile too but she did not know that the hypermobility was hEDS, let alone that it would be more severe than me than in he.

Genetics are just a lottery and I did not get the right ticket. I hope time can heal this wound a little "
401," There arent really any parents around here who are in the same situation. For my GP and pediatrician, I am their first hEDS (and POTS for that matter) patient ever 

I did convince her to talk to our GP when he gets back in office so I hope he can point her to some resources. Its just that waiting lists will probably be long and I hate to see her struggle with things like this... "
402," Yeah, thats true. Unfortunately there is no genetic testing for the diseases that seem to run in the family, at least not yet. 

My mother her maternal grandmother did exhibit MS and hEDS signs already according to my mom and grandmom (like being unable to feel a cup when she picked it up for the MS and being very flexible for hEDS), so it seems those 2 just run in the family (they both skipped my grandmom, and I luckily do not have MS yet to our knowledge, my last MRI was clean. But then MS usually doesn't come on until 20s/30s). "
403," Thank you, this is excellent advice.

It just hurts to see my mom beat herself up over something she cannot control "
404," Quite recent. I have had a HSD diagnosis since December, then POTS came in june and CFS/ME and hEDS instead of HSD came this past Thursday "
405," Not just in the shower lmao

True tho "
406," Basically the title. I have hEDS, POTS and ME/CVS. My mom feels so guilty that she put me on the world because I have to go through all of this. I told her that that is bullshit but she is not having it.

She has also called herself a bad mom for it (the hEDS comes from her side of the family, and she has MS so most days are a struggle for both if us).

I do not resent her at all, I just did not quite win the genetic lottery. Thats OK, it happens. I can live with this, even if going to school is nearly impossible (I am 16). I will get there some day. 

How do I convince her that she is not a bad mom and that she should feel no guilt? "

I cannot find anything on this online. Anyone else have them?

I also have ME/CFS and hEDS, if it has nothing to do with POTS, could it be either of those? "
427," Just went to a POTS specialist (I already had the POTS diagnosis, but the diagnosing doctor was unwilling to treat me). I was diagnosed with HSD before because my GP did not feel comfortable giving me a hEDS diagnosis and the geneticist said that I was not worth the time.

But now it is here. Sadly I also have ME/CFS, but I honestly do not care what label I have anymore. This is just the first step to maybe feeling a tiny bit better. That feeling is just damn great. "

My physical therapist said it was a miracle I didn't tear any muscles or dislocated my knee, and insisted that was my hypermobility (I still had severe damage to my MCL, slight damage to my ACL and a severe bone bruise, but ah well. I can walk again somewhat painfree). "
446, Agree 
447, If you are willing to do it anonymous (like without name mostly) over email then sure! 
448," Well karma whoring didn't really work out in your favor.

Made me chuckle tho. My upvote is yours now "
449," It still could be contact dermatitis, I got it from my clothing the other day. I don't think sheets could be different.

I haven't had it since that day again, even after wearing the same piece of clothing "
450, Yes i did

455, Agree 
456," The line goes through points (4,1) and (7,5)

The standard formula is N=b*g^(t)

You know 2 sets of N and t, so you can solve for B and g "

460, Can they come over to your house? Maybe organize a dinner party or movie night and invite them over? 
461," Most of my friends are online friends. I have 2 real life friends, but I only meet up with one of them. She comes to my house mostly. I sometimes also FaceTime my online/real life friends which feels nice. 

Due to having a lot of online friendships I hardly ever feel lonely. I have no idea how I would do all this without technology. "

No cure for it though, just fighting symptoms "

470, Agree 
471, So basically Netherlands and Biles lol 
472," According to a practice Cambridge test, I am in between C1 and C2 level so quite fluent. I have several internet friends that I communicate with exclusively in English.

I think my consumption is mostly English (reddit and a lot of series, although mostly with Dutch subtitles), but my output is mostly Dutch (except for writing).

It's very interesting indeed "
473," Yes, eventually we solved it. I just felt so stupid for not knowing why dividing did not work. All good now though "
474, I do swimming. I love it! 
475," Thank you!

Like I said im in 12th grade so I have seen my fair share of equations. We were just never taught that dividing by x in an inequality was an invalid action, so this problem confused me for a bit "
476," Yes, that is what we got too, thank you! "
477," Yes you can expand the terms and end up with a valid solution.

We were wondering why you could not divide by a term, but that is all clear now. Thanks! "
478," You get x-3x+2 which is real for all numbers for x. If you solve by expanding you get a real answer (x2 or x2, i forgot which one)

Well you get smaller/larger or equal than but that has no symbol on the keyboard "
479," Title says it all basically. 

So my native language is Dutch, I speak Dutch during the entire day. My thoughts are in English and so are my dreams. However I still sleeptalk in Dutch. Why all this language discrepancy? "

I wouldn't have known him otherwise "

Attention was sneezing or coughing. 

Question number was by a subtle certain movement (one for each number 0-9) like crossing your legs.

A through E were certain pen clicks.

We never got noticed.

Also I had a teacher who was blind in 1 eye so we would sit on his bad side and he couldn't see us "

487," I threw my cat out of the window.

He was fine. I was a 4 year old who thought mister cat could fly. He could not "
488," Not yet, he was probably just playing in the dirt or his litter or whatever .

Just keep it monitored, if it doesn't go away then get worried. But not yet "
489, As a kid I always did this 
490," I get x=1 and x=9 too. Notice they are both valid solutions, did you input them both at the same time? "
491, Agree

493, Well luckily now there's no risk for the kid to be vaccinated lmao 
494, Tell us more! 
495," In the eyes of the kid, she is not the asshole if her dad does not shows her that she is an asshole for bullying "
496," Have you read the entire comment?

The commenter seems to mean that in the eyes of his daughter he is the asshole, but that he actually isn't. (OC please correct me if I am wrong) "
497," I think this differs from person to person. For me, my biggest problem are my shoulders so im going to focus on that:

Dislocation is actual heavy pain, unable to move fingers at all, not easy to pop back in (requires force)

Subluxation is soreness, just a little loss of strength in the hand and with a bit of moving its back in

Everything without any pain and that goes back in with only 1 movement is normal (not EDS) "
498, You really think that is what someone who lost a loved one will think about? 
499," Resting a lot good and I started a cream with diclofenac (recommended by the pharmacy) which is helping somewhat without any side effects (although this might be specific to my situation).

Still hurts like hell, but a little less hell lol.

Thank you for your interest! "

I am not in an English speaking country so a picture of my book would be useless, which is why I put the question in the title instead of the picture "
503," Okay, thank you! "
504," No, only codeine. The cough syrup will mot work enough against the pain unfortunately. Its already better than yesterday, i think i am just going to stick to rest now.

Still thank you for your advice "
505," The pills are on prescription, but the coughing drink is without prescribtion. No idea if the coughing drink helps with the pain "

507, I was secretly hoping my unanswered question was in here lol 
508, Unfortunately I would need a prescription for that which I won't be able to get until Tuesday... 
509," He doesn't believe you can have side effects from paracetamol (which I now know is the same as what you call Tylenol). He thinks I am making my complaints about being nauseous after taking it up, and that I just shouldn't complain.

Dunno if you read the edit, but the doctor who says that is not my primary GP. My 'own' doctor is in only on Tuesdays and he is amazing (which is why I don't want to look for a new GP) . I was looking for some pain relief until I can get in on Tuesday (if still necessary) "
510," I am not US, so I looked up tylenol. It's the same things as paracetamol. So that's a no no because of the side effects I get unfortunately.

And yes, I got just naproxen. But that worked great (on the pill now so it's not needed anymore) "
511, We will get some pineapple tomorrow! Thank you for the suggestion 
512," No.

For this time, I am going to be calling the 2 slopes a and b (just so it's easier to write) 

A*b=-1

B=(-1)/a

Since A=-(1/2),we get

B=(-1)/(-(1/2))=-1*-2=2

Checking back, 2*(-(1/2)) is indeed - 1. In you calculation, you said that a number divided by itself is the number, while it is actually 1. If one of the numbers is negative, it will therefor be - 1 "
513," Thank you for the suggestion! My shoulder doesn't seem to be too swollen, but maybe that's just because I've seen it in worse shape (ruptured my capsula about 6 months ago, and it was huge) 

The naproxen I was on was for severe period pains and I don't have any left (and I would need to get them prescribed again which I doubt my doctor is willing to do. I added an edit to my original post to clear up any confusedness) "
514," He doesn't believe that reactions to the over the counter stuff can be so severe. He did prescribe the naproxen for my periods but well, those need a prescription and I won't get any because I haven't tried paracetamol yet (since I get bad side effects).

Just kind of hoped there would be some miracle, over the counter pain med out there. Guess too bad for me "
515," He doesn't believe that reactions to the over the counter stuff can be so severe. He did prescribe the naproxen for my periods but well, those need a prescription and I won't get any because I haven't tried paracetamol yet (since I get bad side effects).

Just curious, what would I need an anti-inflammatory for? I have a slightly raised CRP too, is that actually just the HSD? 

Just kind of hoped there would be some miracle, over the counter pain med out there. Guess too bad for "

517," X+2y=16 

2y=-x+16

Y=-(1/2)x+8

For perpendicular lines you get a1*a2=-1. 

A1=-(1/2)

-(1/2)*a2=-1

A2=2

There is only one answer with a slope of 2, that is the 3rd answer

I am curious how you got your answer though? "
518," I was diagnosed with both POTS and anxiety disorder by a neurologist (I have hyperventilation, which I now know can be caused by POTS or just life, working hard at it in physical therapy), my psychologist got the anxiety disorder out of my file after our first appointment.

I am glad you finalky found some clarity! "
519,  
520," Oh my, sounds like disaster "
521, How is that 104.3% even possible lmao. 
522," Okay, I am not a native English speaker and I clearly didn't get my point across, I am sorry for that.

What I am trying to say that if modern medicine has no more solutions or only has very invasively solutions, alternative medicine may as well be explored if this is not at the cost of the patient and with adequate monitoring.

There is certainly a place for alternative medicine, just not as an actual alternative.

I have a chronic illness and so does my mom (both autoimmune) and I know that alternative medicine has helped us both when regular medicine had no more solutions for us. Whether it was placebo or not, it probably was. But it helped
The patient felt better and (in my moms case) the blood values stabilized.

We did not replace modern medicine with alternatives (we would both be in a wheelchair by now if we did), but if it is in the benefit of a patient, does it really matter?

Also worth noting I am not in the US so homeopathy (and certain other alternative medicines) are free here. No waste of funds. "
523," Ok, this might be different in the US. Forgot about that.

Homeopathy is free here "
524, Just saying that homeopathy isn't all bad. I just think it has to be used in conjuction with 'modern' medicine and under good contact with an actual doctor. 
525, I guess it has the placebo effect on its side though... 
526," Have you found any outside help yet?

Yes, the baby can eat baby food but he can still get dehydrated. A 6 month old should have 200ml of milk three to four times a day, with some water on the side! "
527," I like putting on some sports in the background, I have a Playlist of games I have already seen that I like to put on while studying.

Also try changing the atmosphere. Sit in a different room or even in a completely different place, like a coffee shop or your neighbours house "
528," We unfortunately do not have a bathtub, and my hair is too long to be washed under the sink.

Great you found something that works for you though! "
529, Use ((new-old) /old) *100% to get the percentages yourself 
530," I have a fitbit inspire HR. Works great, but not if you want to look back at your day and see the spikes. It takes an average of your HR over 5 minutes in the app. When looking directly at the watch, it seems fairly accurate. "
531," Oh wow, hadn't noticed that... We didn't get to fractions until 7th grade,guess that is where my suprisedness comes from "
532," This is grade 2. There has to be another way, right? Are fractions even taught in grade 2? "
533," I dont shower unless I want to wash my hair anymore. Showering gives me extreme pain in my hands, leaving me unable to touch anything a few hours after I have showered.

I was myself. I use small towels and make some water+soap in the sink. Then I dip the small towels in the sink and wash myself really good. After I have done a body part, I use 1 bigger towel to dry off myself.

It takes way longer than showering but because it causes so much less pain, it is less exhausting to me "
534, Pregnant? 
535," Sorry to say it but you just gotta force yourself to do it.

Are there any sports you like? I often put up a replay of a game I have seen before. Seeing others do stuff makes me do stuff.

There are even some studying videos out there (like actual people filming themselves study). It creeps me out, but it might motivate you "
536, A little more info would be nice. What subject and grade? 
537," Thank you. Helped.

I do have the book but I think watching the movie first will make me understand it better. I have read a summary but I want something a little more than that "
538," Do you know the ABC-formula?

539," It actually goes in full cycles of 90 minutes, but you only arrive in deep sleep about 30 minutes after falling asleep "
540," Y=3x-4 is indeed a straight line with slope 3 and y-intercept - 4. Seems like a trick question. Is this part of a question where you have to calculate the intercepts between this line and a parabola maybe? 

A parabola is always a second degree equation. The equation you were given is of the first degree "
541," Luckily fall for me, but this is what I did in the summer:

Some foods and scents make me more nauseated than others, I stay far away from all else (and yes, that means dinner is either home made pizza, pasta or bread with meat). 

Keep up on my salt and water intake. 

Keep up on my sleep. 

I use domperidone. Doesn't take away all nausea but certainly helps to take away a large amount of it.

I also used a cool pack in my neck after eating, I would get huge sweat attacks which I started using it for but it helped with the nausea.

Laying down after eating and keeping my feet elevated while eating.

Eating 6 to 8 smaller portions instead of 3 big ones.

Theres probably more but that is all I can think of for now. "
542," I have only fainted once from tachycardia, but that was my fault (I was playing just dance before I got diagnosed).

I do however faint if an infection comes on, then I usually just faint while laying down bc my heartrate gets real slow.

Fainting does not have to come with POTS. It can, but it does not have to "
543," I have the same thing. No real story, just that an hour is the maximum I can focus for most days, and I am wiped after "
544," My physical therapist started me on resistance band exercises too, it's great!

Don't become too ambitious though, I now have an overuse injury in my big toe "
545," Woah man, how do you type a square root? "
546," I deleted Instagram and snapchat. 

How much time I spent on there. I had so much free time. Also how other teens (I was 13 at the time, 16 now) will think you are some idealist and that you just want to grow up fast. 

Then reddit came along. My spare time was gone "
547, A failed kidney transplant 
548, Agreed 
549," According to my doctor, those are actually subluxes (when they go far enough and dont pop back in theirselves). I tore my capsule because of it, but not much you can do IME.

I always carry around a sling so if the pain gets really bad I can give it some extra support "
550, Doesnt Jade on a world team mean she forfeits her individual spot? 
551, Agree 
552, No problem! Silly mistakes are often the worst to catch 
553, I got a numerator of 3th^(2)+3t^(2)h+h^(3)+4th+h^(2) which can then be rewritten as h(3th+3t^(2)+h^(2)+4t+h). Now the h can cancel out 
554," Can you use repeat numbers? If so, remember that 0.1+0.9=1, 0.2+0,8=1 etcetera "
555, Thank you! 
556," Thank you! I do indeed get very stressed from not knowing what to expect, although a lot seems to differ from doctor to doctor (for example with eating and drinking, according to someone who went to my doctor they asked to hydrate very well the day of the test). 

The center is about 1.5 hours driving so we have a hotel for afterwards, that way I can do absolutely nothing the rest of the day indeed (I have car sickness so driving takes a lot from me). "
557," Zekers, V6 wiskunde B is geen makkie helaas "
558, What sub is this from? 
559," I am dutch but my German is decent.

See if you can watch some German series with English subtitles for now. If you are a bit more familiar, start watching the news in German (no subtitles). That will get you quite some way in listening.

Apps like duolingo or babbel can help you build some vocabulary.

Maybe find a fun German blog you can read too.

Good luck! "
560, Elbows for sure 
561," Mmm OK, did not know that. When we get back in Tuesday I will ask about it. Thank you! "
562," I have not, but the first time I was ever bitten by a tick was after I fainted for the first time (and long after I got sick/got my diagnosis). Or can you get bitten without knowing it? "
563," What if you win nothing at all?

Now you walk away with less "
564," The area is the triangle+the rectangle+the semi circle. The triangle is equilateral, so all sides are the same. This means that x is also the diameter of the circle. You can now set up an equation using x and y for each of the 3 parts. Add them together and let it equal 50. Now isolate the y "
565," I have an overuse injury (in my big toe), no PT on the right leg for me today. I will go do my left leg now though! "
566," Yes, there is always someone who has it worse. I like to remind myself of that.

Thank you for sharing your experience! "
567, I sincerely hopes this works for you! Keep us updated 
568," If you feel good, then opinions from others really should not matter. If they ever say it again and you feel the need to counteract, just tell them you have fast metabolism. If not, let them live their life. You don't have to change for others, you only have to change for you "
569," If you tell him you feel healthier and fitter when you have a little higher weight, any reasonable doctor will help you. It doesn't have to be a medical thing, but a nutritionist/dietician can help you find high calorie foods that don't have a lot of sugars and fats. 

Good luck on this journey! "
570," You first simplify the expression, then you basically just fill in the number.

If you have a specific question about any of the questions, please let me know which you are struggling with. "
571," Still need help? I am not too terrible in maths, shoot me a PM. "
572, Any chance you can get into a dietician? Your doctor might be able to refer you to one who deals with these kinds of issues

580, 78 
581," Thank you! I am glad you had such a positive experience, I hope I will too "
582," Thank you! I am 16 and the specialist is 1,5 hours away so going alone is not an option at all. My initial jump was already 50bpm, curious to see what it will jump to then.

I just do badly in unknown situations, knowing what to expect really calmes my nerves "

When a line intersects 2 parallel lines, you can get z-angles (shown here). They often go hand in hand with F-angles, but those are not important in this problem.

See if you see a situation like one of those above involving the Y and the upper x "
585," AB and JK are parallel, so you can use Z-angles.

Can you try it from there? "
586," Ah okay, I thought you were talking about consistently late indeed. I hate being late too, always early myself "
587," If it is a pattern, it might be "
588, Just laying down then standing up on my own. Basically the way people self diagnose on here all the time (but mine was done in the doctors office) 
589," So I got the POTS diagnosis with a poor mans tilt table test (78 to 131). My diagnosing doctor will not treat me though, so I am going to a POTS specialist in 3 weeks and I am super nervous. I know I will get an actual tilt table test there, and I hate not knowing what to expect.

What are some must-knows about a tilt table test? "
590," How is that understandable? You agreed on a time, and one party is not honoring this agreement (even if they are just 1 minute late) "
591," There are some great apps too if you can endure screens. Otherwise online there are a lot of books to order, but grocery stores tend to carry them as well where I live "
592," Yes, I am saying that if the 82 is in the minority it could very well be a wrong reading. Try taking your pulse manually from now on (still not super accurate, but probably a bit better) "
593, Im really into word searches on the bad days at the moment 
594," How do you measure your HR now during the PMTT? A lot of home equipment is by far not as accurate as what they use. I have read some things about us adapting too (subconciously using your leg muscles to get the blood up anyways), which is something you dont have in a real tilt table test.

Good luck at the appointment! "
595, Can you teach my mom how? She is terrified of all butterflies 
596, Yay for good news! 
597," I've had fevers much higher (think 102.5) without any shivering. My normal temp is around 98 to 98.5, quite average

Edit: this fever was here about 2 weeks ago too (when I fainted we went to urgent care, it was high too but just shoved off to a cold or flu, which I didn't have), maybe that can cause shivering? "
598, I saw eythora thorsdottir and I didn't ask for a picture. It would have been so cool to have a picture with an elite gymnast 
599," Very slight one (Google says around 99.7F), not enough to cause such extreme coldness. "
600," Oh man, that sucks.

Besides my usual POTS symptoms being amplified and extreme coldness, I have no symptoms. That is what makes this all so unusual "
601," The foods that causes discomfort differs from person to person.

Personally, I avoid processed sugar in general but some processed sugars are fine. I cannot eat certain veggies but I can eat others.

Just try some things and you will get there. Some people cut out gluten, others cut out carbs, others don't cut out anything. "
602," I already am on the pill because of bad periods, but even then it can take me 2 or 3 days to recover.

The pill is amazing though, I now only have to get my period 3 times a year "
603," Which, when solved for, is the same as x+x+1+x+2. Original commenter skipped a step "
604," Lets say you can get 1000 coins as base price.

The event adds 100%, you now recieve (1000*2=)2000 coins.

The booster adds 50%, you now recieve (2000+0,5*1000=) 2500 coins.

So that is a boost of 150% "
605," First off, the densities in your table are calculated in g cm^-3 so we will first transfer your units. 

The volume was 0,31L = 310 cm^(3). 

The mass is 6,46 kg-5,625kg=0,835kg= 835 g

Density is calculated as mass/volume, which is 835g/310 cm^(3) which is approximately 2,694 g/cm^(3)

Now find what element corresponds to that density value "
606," A^(b/c) = croot(a^b ) 

In 2^(1/12) , a=2,b=1 and c=12

So 2^(1/12) =12root(2)

Sorry if 12root is not the right expression, basically take the cube root but replace the 3 with a 12 (or any other value of C you get in another problem) "
607," My PCP does not have the means to do a culture unfortunately, if it ever comes back we will ask for a referral to the hospital and all that. For now, tomorrow it is just getting infection levels checked. Thank you for the suggestion though! Sorry to hear you had a rough go with it. I have never had an UTI before "
608, Who is cutting onions here? 
609, Thank you for your answer! 
610," As far as I know (as my PCP told me. I was not diagnosed at that time, I just had low blood pressure) salt raises blood pressure. If your blood pressure is normal, extra salt can get you high blood pressure which can in turn be bad for your heart. Eating extra salt is OK as long as your blood pressure is normal.

I do not know how salt and POTS relate, just salt and blood pressure "
611," I could try there but I had already gone to the bathroom an hour before so I had nothing to give. The doctor then told me they prefer first pee of the day so I am just going with what he said. All was tested for this day anyways though, giving it now or tomorrow morning wont give me the results faster "
612," Yes, but it needed to be morning urine so we will turn it in tomorrow morning with results following tomorrow afternoon. I just want my research done in advance so I can bring up any concerns with the doctor at that time "
613, Saw this just too late for current derby but we would love to have you! I will PM you the info 
614," I stay put, save fuel and check in every few hours to see if the building where I stopped at has a request for me "
615," Putting the units next to your numbers can help significantly 

What you calculated now is in grams per mole. How do you go from g/mol to either g or mole? "
616," Sketch out the problem.

Solve with a substitution of the inequality sign by an equal sign.

Read the answer from your graph: f(x)  g(x) asks for the values of x where the graph of f is above the graph of g "
617, Yes indeed. Works amazing

620," Ah, my previous bun always wanted to play with my cat. Cat would run away, bun right behind him. Bun was bigger than cat at that time.

Now cat is bigger than our new bun, and he thinks bun is some kind of pray unfortunately "
621," I am mostly over it, I made some great friends when I got into high school and nobody from my elementary school went to the same high school as me. Gave me a great fresh start.

Obviously if you want to talk, I am here for you too! "
622," I am in Europe, in 12th grade. I got beaten daily in elementary school, as well as bullied in other ways.

It happens here too "
623," 4ln(2)-(1/4)ln(2)

If you just substitute ln(2)=u for now, it will become an easier problem

4u-1/4u=15/4u

So you can simplify your slope to (15/4)ln(2) "
624," It does not just show carbs, also salts, vitamins, fats and a few more I think "
625," According to the person who sold and mounted my new seat, it wasn't one you could take off easily as it was. It probably took them 10 minutes with tools. Like wtf? "
626," My bike did not get stolen, just the seat. Not all thieves go for the entire bike "
627," I am so glad you are so supportive. 

The one person that does not get it is my dad. He thinks I am making it worse than it is, that it is all in my head and that my pshycholist can fix it (I am seeing a psychologist to learn how to deal with it). 

The rest of my family is very supportive though, at least those that know. The ones that don't would probably suggest yoga (that is what they did with my mom, who has MS). 

That being said, I have stabilized quite a lot since started exercising. I only go swimming once a week, but for me it is the difference between not attending school at all to attending 2 or 3 classes per week (still modified sitting arrangements etc, but I am there at least) 

I also lost 30 pounds because of POTS. Now that I am on domperidone I can eat more, but I have to eat all day just to keep the weight on. Like my physical therapist said it, you are constantly running a marathon with your heart fluctuating so much. I am still in the healthy weight though luckily (5'8 and 130 pounds) "
628," I have HSD but yes, entirely possible.

My left shoulder was always most stable. Then I dislocated it fully. Now it is least stable.

Also had a bone bruise with some stretched/partially torn ligaments in my knee and that still hurts from time to time and can now hyper extend far further than it ever could (does not dislocate though). "
629," I don't use any meds yet, but my mom who has MS does so this is her system. 

She has a pill organizer. Every day has a seperate little box, and each box has 4 compartments. She uses them morning, noon, dinner, night since that are the 4 moments she takes her pills. Then the little day boxes stack up so you only have 1 little box out each day. 

She refills her boxes on either Sunday evening or Monday morning (depending on how she feels). Occasionally my dad and/or I do it for her. 

I think she got hers through the pharmacy, might be worth inquiring about. Otherwise maybe Amazon or something similar. A pill organizer and a set time to fill them might help you though! "
630," Okay, helped.

Was just a bit confused bc the app said 'write and eat', but those are not the same for me "
631," First you need to calculate how many boots were sold. (5/24)*360=75

That means that 360-75=285=sneakers+slippers

14/19 of those 285 were sneakers, that means the remaining 5/19 were slippers.

(5/19)*285=75. 75 pairs of slippers were sold. "
632," I have the fitbit inspire HR. On screen, it does a really good job tracking my HR. In the app however, it averages out a 5 minute period so I rarely can look back and see how my HR was doing that day.

Still really like it though.

I have heard good things about the polar a370, appearantly it has a function that will give an alarm as soon as your HR gets above a certain treshold. Never tried it myself though "
633," If you have specific questions, try r/HomeworkHelp "
634," Body weight exercises are great for doing at home.

Examples: jumping jacks, push ups, sit ups, tuck ups, squats. There are quite some 7 minute workout apps out there that contain exercises like these and that will set up a plan for you. Maybe look into one of those? A bunch of them are free, too "
635, No problem. Keep working hard! 
636," https://imgur.com/gallery/Gk8k5Rn

It sounds like you have the right idea in mind. Just keep practicing! "
637," Why do you think adding that 0 is incorrect? I will work it out for you, be right back. "
638," If you realize that 13627:180000 is the same as 1,3627:18, it will be a lot easier to solve with long division. I can work it out for you if you find that easy, but try it yourself first! "
639, Sigfigs is my new favorite word. Thank you 
640," Fun story: my mom is super pro vaccine for me, but I had to convince her to vaccinate our new rabbit. Just glad I got through to her! "

644," How little you sleep

How little you study 

They both tend to be over exaggerated too "
645, Do you have a photo of your work? I will too. The answer should be 130 months 
646," Nope.

Edit: remember n=n/1 and a/b=c/d gives ad=bc "
647," Seems like you all got it under control then!

Maybe track a day or 2 of what you eat in a calorie counting app. Most of them also show nutrients (I belive my fitness pal does) "
648," Let her attempt it and I can check/explain those she does not get.

Productive struggle can be good.

For now, just remind her of place values "
649," A is right.

Can you show your work for B? I got a different answer "
650," I have a hole in my eardrum after a surgery when I was small never healed properly. It is a rare complication. It might be EDS (I have HSD, but same thing) related, it does not have to be.

Might be worth going to an ENT about it though "
651," I am, what is she struggling with? "
652," Also try going back to your original comment and editing it there. I appreciate the point you just gave me, but the person who actually gave you the advice that you needed deserves a point too "
653," Yes, that sounds much better! Just make sure you also have variation in what veggies you eat. Maybe have some snack veggies or fruits (some fruits contain more sugar than others) in between meals. This helps keep your blood sugar steady and therefore you have less appetite for unhealthy snacks. 

The only thing I see missing is fish. It is not necessary, but fish is a good addition for healthy fats (I think 2 times per week is recommended? Might differ from country to country too). Gives you a little variation. Could eat it for lunch or dinner. 

Also maybe some different nuts than peanuts? Again, variation is key for both nutrition and for actually enjoying what you eat (which is obviously very important) 

From your original post I thought you had nuts and only green veggies 3 meals a day, with some meat or an egg a few times a week. That, of course, would not have been healthy. "
654," For 1, fill in t=0

Edit: 1 is incorrect if that was not clear yet

For 2,say P(t) =1000

Did that answer the question? "
655, The word helpful does not give any points. Try the word helped instead! 
656," Better, but still maybe not the healtiest. If you can, consult with a nutritionist (which is not the same as a dietician) to make sure you will not make yourself unhealthy while trying to become healthier "
657," Oh okay, that makes more sense indeed. I assumed you meant paying part of rent or groceries "
658," Only thing is without pictures (which you should NOT post, to be clear. Do NOT post pictures of those kind of things on the internet. Better not send them to your friends either, but that is another topic for another time) we cannot be 100% sure. 

As long as it is not bothering you though, all is good regardless of what some internet strangers say. You know your body best "
659," Oh okay. All good then. Be prepared to gain some weight when putting sugar back in though, that is completely normal "
660," Do you have a doctor you can talk to about this stuff?

What you descibe sounds normal to me but if you worry, going to the doctor for a piece of mind is OK. Maybe mention it at your next check up if you cannot make an appointment yourself (and dont want your mom coming with you) "
661," If you like your body and then go back to your old eating habits, the weight will come right back on (if not faster than before). One piece of cake now will not do it, but a temporary diet absolutely will "
662," Only eating greens and nuts is NOT a real diet. You need variation, otherwise you could very easily get malnutrition "
663," Heck, OP is 17. He should NOT be obligated to pay household bills "
664," 2a-6b can factor out 2, making it 2(a-3b). Therefor (2a-6b)^2 =(2(a-3b))^2

After that (a*b)^2 =a^2 *b^2

Did that answer your question? "
665, I have always wanted to go to a casino on my 18th bday 
666, First thing I think of is spin it into someone dreaming. Dreaming has the most absurd things happening. 
667," Pilates/yoga do have non bendy poses too.

Recumbent biking or a hometrainer will get the heartrate up but maybe that are options.

Do you have a physical therapist? They can also help you with these kind of things, and you can probably get it covered by insurance (depending on what you have) "
668," Yes, it is such a double feeling. I was very happy that I figured out what was wrong with me, but at the same time I was sad because it also meant the chances of me getting completely better are very, very small "
669, Good luck to you too! 
670," It is not bullying unless both parties agree it is bullying, and they both dislike it.

At least I think so. European here too. Just spent too much time on reddit "
672, Shemar Moore? He plays Derek Morgan. 
673," I am in 12th grade, I got sick midway through 11th grade.

Today was actually my first day (well I went one 45 minute period, but you gotta start somewhere) back to school since last March (when I got sick). The plan is to go 1 period on Thursday and 2 periods on Tuesday. 

Now that I have the equivalent of a 504 plan, going to school is a lot easier. I am allowed to eat and drink during class, have my feet up on another chair, I have a place where I can lay down if all goes really wrong (and I am allowed to go there without asking the teacher) and my teachers know the situation and they are aware in how to handle. I am also exempt from PE. 

I am also splitting 12th grade. It will take me a year longer to graduate, but only having half the coursework is really good for me (especially since I am diagnosed but untreated, although that will hopefully change in October).

It is very frustrating for sure and I did lose aquintances over it (those people you sit next to in class but never meet up with), I totally get it.

Do you have any accommodations in place already? If not, look into it. They are required to accommodate you. "
674," My doctors think I am too young for compression stockings so I cannot get them prescribed unfortunately. Hoping another doctor might, but I do not see him until october "
675," Not just insulin, but most medications that are granted a monopoly (usually those for more rare diseases where only one party is needed to produce it thus gets the monopoly) "
676," Which ones are giving you trouble? Can you show your work?

Remember (a*b)/c= a*(b/c) , that should get you quite far. "
677," Otherwise said, A*B=0 means A=0 or B=0 "
678, I tried some of the generic ones but they hurt a lot on my legs and did not seem to help my symptoms unfortunately 
679," How? I do often have 10 ready but with my fishing book mostly complete, diamond income is rare...hoping that the valley daily quests will change that "
680," Best in my opinion is every time someone cries out of fear, and I swear I am not a psychopath "
681, It is raining cats and dogs 
682," Okay I get your point, I was just disagreeing that common sense is all that common (it is not) "
683," While I do agree with that, it is also extremely frustrating to do all 9 (most do 10) tasks at 320 and still not get top 3 just because you are not willing to use diamonds. We are not lazy by any kind, just not willing to spend real life money. For us, this levels the playing field a bit "
684, Any animal related sub 
685," I use one of them that you have to stop taking for a week, I only HAVE to stop taking it every few months (when I get spot bleeding or cramping).

I now only have my period 2 or 3 times per year.

Also, when you do get your 'period' it is a lot less heavy. There was no egg (TSH gets inhibited through the substances in the pill, thus no egg ever gets ready to come out), just uterus buildup.

But yes, obviously discuss with a doctor (for me, my PCP prescribed them, I have never seen a gynaecologist before). This all differs from person to person "
686, They will be anyway though? We are a 320 only hood regardless of how many 320 tasks spawn. Our standard does not get lower because of the tasks we are being given 
687," This is not as much common sense as you would think, it is illegal here and they give out multiple tickets a day for using the phone on a bike "
688," You fill in the x-values into the formula.

F(x) =3x-1 means f(z)=3z-1. You substitute that what is in parentheses into the x-value. 

If you want to evaluate x=3, f(3)=3*3-1. 

For x=-2, f(-2)=3*-2-1=-7 "
689, Why too many though? I would rather have a lot than not enough 
690," Why would it be? Racing was the love of his life. If his family (who most likely organized the funeral) felt this was what he wanted, they have every right to do as they see fit. "

695," NAH. In my opinion, your mom is in the wrong. She is however not an asshole for believing in a religion. Close minded is the best word I can think of too, but not an asshole "
696," Thank you! Our vet does not have that option unfortunately, so we will just keep monitoring it. If it gets worse or it starts to bother him, vet time it is.

We just feel bad for that little one, only 15 weeks old and 2 times to the vet already "
697," You need to use the distance formula. 

d(A,B) = sqare root ((Xb-Xa) ^2 + (Yb-Ya) ^2))

You know d(A,B), Xa, Xb and Ya. You should be able to calculate Yb. "
698, He has a strong dislike for movement

705," Nope, only one cat in this house! "
706," NTA

My grandfather almost died in a hospital (twice), seeing him on a breathing tube was really hard for me. However when my mom, dad or grandmother were in the hospital after all that happened (all 3 at different times, for unrelated issues), they nver forced me to go. Like it should be.

Your situation sounds even tougher, and you are not the adult in this situation. That said, maybe it is good to talk about this with another adult. Maybe a teacher at school that you trust, or your grandmother?

Good luck in all there is to come "
707," Oh we played that, he did not leave me much of a choice.

Happy cake day btw "
708," Ha, told him this and got some bland looks.

You have a point "
709, Touche 
710," Our Ramses has a whole bold spot underneath his chin (basically on his breast). We have not found the missing fur. He is too much of a diva to let us take a picture. Is that moulting?

 We had a rabbit before but he never had moulting this severe. He also made nests out of his fur (even though he was male), so he is not any comparison material in this case. 

But really, should we be worried? Or is this normal? "
711," Not true at all.

I am dutch and proposed this to my mom and grandma. They told me to not be so absurd.

Not wanting to celebrate tho "
712," That's not awkward, that's just life "
713," My little one (well, he was a fat, 16 year old Norwegian forest cat so not so little) past away from diabetes 2 years ago after a battle for over 3 years. It is a sucky disease for sure... "
714,  
715," I saw a program on TLC about a boy who did not feel pain, he bit off his own tongue and burnt himself more times than they could count. Terrifying indeed "
716," After our old cat died, our young cat was mourning, looking for his step brother. We now have some supplements, and it has helped him so much to calm down, really something to ask your vet about. Also a small routine (like feeding at the same time every day) can help a lot.

Sorry you are going through that "
717, TIL the thumb only has 2 pads. Thank you for this discovery 
718," Is bagging items for you like, a real thing? I always thought that was just in the movies.

TIL I guess.

Also just in my European opinion, NAH but really, you cannot bag your groceries yourself? "
719," Native Dutch and frisian, with fluent English.

It really depends on what I am doing. For example when thinking about school, I think in Dutch. For basically all other thoughts in life, either fully English or mostly English with some dutch or frisian words mixed in "
720, That is what I am wondering too. The lawyer you might want to choose also depends on the crime you might or might not have committed. I would want a different lawyer for murder vs. sexual harassment on the workfloor (as an example) 
721, But that gives headaches. Almost as bad as comic sans 
722, And germans. I have some german friends and we talk german/frisian to each other. And part of my family was not frisian by nature but they picked it up very quickly 
723," I am diagnoses HSD, but hEDS is something that is suspected (just nobody who can diagnose it, so I have the HSD diagnosis).

I am 16. It does not bother me too much, but my skin is very fragile so wound healing takes ages. Also, my shoulders sublux and from time to time fully dislocate. Also, I did not know that was not normal until I was 15 "
724, What other way would there be? 
725," You can also use the doubling formula: sin(2A)=2 * sin(A) * cos (A)

So sin(2x)=sin(x)

Sin (A)= sin (B) gives A=B+2k pi or A= pi-B+2k pi

2x=x+ 2k pi or 2x=pi-x+2k pi

X=2k pi or 3x= pi+2k pi

X=2k pi or x=pi/3 + 2/3 k pi

Depending on the interval you can now calculate the solutions by filling in k=1,2,3 etc "
726," As a frisian, it really is not that hard. It is kind of dutch but also kind of German, which a lot of dutch people are somewhat proficient in "
727," For A, you can set up a system of equations using point (15,250) and the points given at t=5,10,20,25,30. 

For B, you will now pick 2 lines and determine the dy/dx (also known as the slope). Once you have 2 dy/dx values, take the average of them.

For C, sketch the graph and draw a tangent line in t=15. Determine the dy/dx.

Does that make it clear? "
728," Yeah, quite sure we have that one indeed (well, minus the purple bits in between the teeth). Thank you for doing the research though! "
729," We have invested in a lint roller and a good brush (looks like the one you linked) for our cat, I think using the same one would be all good. Not US, so I cannot try that specific one but the one we have looks totally alike "
730," Thank you for that thread too! We have completely narrowed it down to the hairs he shed (she is not formally diagnosed but I am formally diagnosed with a severe allergy for Guinea pig hair so it would not be out of the realm of possibilities, she just does not feel like going to the doctor for something so mild). "
731," He is outdoors in the summer and indoor in the winter (a bit controversial, I know. If we see Ramses does not tolerate going out next summer indoor he will come inside full time. My mom is slightly allergic though, so it is not what we prefer.)

This cage is mostly meant for outside. Inside we can barricade the doors etc so he cannot escape and he can just roam the living room (as long as we keep cat out); outside we have had to take out some parts of the fence because our cat cannot jump over the fence anymore (getting old, so he will just fall off sometimes). Our previous rabbit just roamed through the backyard too (because the fence was intact at the time), so this is all a bit new to us. 

We have hard (60 by 60 cm, so large) tiles in the backyard, we also have a cover (forgot the English name but it is fully bunny proof) in the bottom of the current cage. This outside part is also meant as a way for his nails to get smaller in a fairly natural way (as suggested by the vet)

Thank you for the link! "
732, Agreed. It's quite damn great 
733, Happy cake day! 
734," So we have a Netherland dwarf. He is now totally used to his cage and loves walking his leash. Because he loves the outsides so much, we want to make a buildout of his cage, [something like this](https://imgur.com/gallery/NnKHdAe). That way he can run around even more than he already does (he loves running around then chilling on your lap afterwards)!

We currently have [this cage](https://imgur.com/gallery/XBfcf8n) and we would like to build it to connect to the bottom door so he can come out easily.

We also have a cat so something that would be covered on top would be preferred (cat seems scared of the rabbit for now, but you never know what fear does). Also it would be best if it would be removable so we can easily get him out of his cage if he needs to come out. All tips would be appreciated though!

Anyone who has ever made such a project? Any dos/ donts? "
735," The area under the graph gives us (m/s) *s=m, so that gives us distance. With a negative velocity, it will travel backwards (you will get a negative area) so for f you will use normal values. In g, the negative state does not matter, so you will add all absolute values together.

Try dividing the graph into triangles and rectangles, that way you can find the area.

Does that makes it clear? "
736," It is gonna be OK, this is not as hard as it looks (I promise) "
737, That seems like no fun either! 
738," Me and my mom both cannot walk for long, but short distances are fine for both of us. We are a strange couple "
739, Thank you for your answer! 
740, I am 16 
741," My blood pressure in the office was 120/90 which is SUPER high for me (90/50 is my usual)

My temperature was slightly raised, so it might be me getting the cold or the flu. But that is just speculation at this point.

We did order a blood pressure meter for if and when it happens again "
742, Swimming for me. Might be great to cool you down too (although coming out of the water might give you a blow) 
743," I am back now, they said it is just fainting like regular people do. The effects are just more amplified in me apparently.

We were told to come back if my feelings persisted or if it ever happened again, particularly because I do not have my POTS fully under control "
744," Back home now. Doctor there suspected a regular faint, we had to come back if me feeling crap persisted or if it happened ever again "
745," Have you ever fainted from being bradycardic?

This is the first time (as far as my knowledge goes) that I have been bradycardic, so it is all just scary and unsure "
746," Ha, totally! Bonus points  if either of those are followed by 'everyone is tired/is nauseated/has a headache/whatever from time to time' "
747," Yeah, I am 16 and I would be rich if I was given a dime everytime I heard something like 'you look fine, you are too young to be sick anyways' "
748," Thanks! I am quite sure I fainted, it was definitely not falling asleep and I was definitely out for a few seconds.

Internet again said that bradycardia could be a POTS thing, so I figured I would ask on here.

Seems like the ER is the way to go then. Thank you for your advice "
749," So my resting HR has been high all day (around 80 when it usually is 60 to 65).

Right after dinner (well I had 1 sandwich, but still) I went to lay down. I got very bad palpitations. My fitbit said my HR was 49 (and my own pulse taking was not that far off, about 2 beats every 3 seconds). Shortly after, I fainted while laying down. It was only for a few seconds luckily.

This is the first time I have fainted from a low HR (I fainted once before while playing just dance before I was diagnosed). The internet says to go to the ER after fainting when you had palpitations before fainting or fainted while laying down (amongst others), but I do not want to waste their time. I am pretty sure they would not know what POTS is, and I am unsure if this is POTS either.

I am just lost and so unsure what to do. I am 16, my parents told me we could go to the ER if I felt that was the right thing but I just have no idea if it is the right thing at the moment "
750," My mom has MS and I have a form of dysautonomia (POTS). The looks we get are crazy indeed.

Adding on to this, not all people in wheelchairs are mentally disabled. I got sick after my mom and even as a 8 or 9 year old, people asked me everything. Things like what would your mom like to drink, would your mom prefer xyz. Now they often do not know who to ask. But just recognizing that person in a wheelchair is indeed a person is something that we will remember a place by "
751," He probably was not taught that yet (we were taught how to do it with limits first too), so I assumed it was the limit notation for the derivative that is giving him trouble "
752," I worked one out, let me know if that makes it any clearer

https://imgur.com/gallery/qu7c7iY "
753," He does not walk in a harness (he has severe anxiety for certain things, harnesses is one of his fears. We tried and it just did not work). We are lucky enough to live in a nearly car free street (plus everyone only drives 15 km per hour, and there is rarely a car around because of limited parking) so he just walks right by the foot and listens when we (my mom or me, he does not listen to my dad) tell him to stay (for dogs or birds or other cats) "
754," Well, does not have to be an excuse...

Source: my cat loves to go on a walk "
755," No problem! If you need help with anything else, please just ask! "
756," Totally true. I wish I kept it longer (I especially loved the parts about the culture and mythology), but I was failing it so I had to drop it. "
757," Lets say total is T, bike is B, running is R and walking is W

T=B+R+W

If we now subtract R and W from both sides, we get

T-R-W=B+R-R+W-W which becomes B=T-R-W

Question answered? "

761," Since you watched breaking bad, maybe something about crystal meth? "
762," Unsure what you are doing.

A derivative is the change on a small part of the graph, often called delta x and given by h. 

If you need limit notation, use the limit as h approaches 0 of (f(x+h) - f(x)) / h

For x, that would be (limit as h approaches 0) ((x+h) - x) /h

That would be 0

There is a way without the limit, but you will encounter that one soon enough. 

Can you figure out the rest from there? "
763," You have 3 points that you know. (2,8) (4,0) (0,12)

You can now make a system of equations using those 3 points (simply filling in the known x and y values into the standard formula). This should give you one of your three variables (a, b and c)

Can you figure it out from there? "
764," Total= walking+ running+ bicycle. How do you isolate bicycle from that?

For question 2, 2(total)=2(walking+ running+bicycle). Here you want to end up with a running+walking= something

Can you get it from there? "
765," I have that too. I assumed it was insufficient blood flow, not sure though "
766," I was 2nd alternate for state championships (gymnastics) a few years ago. 2nd alternates rarely get in, so last trained my routines 5 or 6 weeks before states. I got a call 10pm the evening before states saying I was in. I ended up last and forgot 2 out of 4 routines.

Since then, there is a rule that all alternates have to know they are competing by the monday before states to allow for sufficient preparation time. "
767," Thank you for the reply! The ones we found are indeed made for soccer playes, but they provide the 28 to 32 mmHg I keep reading about so it seemed like a good choice "
768," Thank you! Funnily my future cardiologist (and POTS specialist) is also in his late 50s, but he does prescribe compression stockings etc.

Most doctors here are around that age though, no avoiding them (and they have been really good to me in the past) "
769, I forgot the wall existed 
770," Okay, thank you for your insight!

Both my pediatrican and PCP are in their 60s, so it might very well be a generation gap. I am basically willing to try anything to feel better.

I will measure again in the morning but I guess small it will be then

EDIT: i did have a hard time finding information, mostly because all english suggestions are not available here and all dutch information is moreso geared towards prescribed, custom made compression stockings (which is not an option for now) "
771," Back strokes are my favorite for when my shoulders hurt. Just like the breaststroke but on the back without the arms.

I rarely do breast crawl, butterfly or back crawl anymore, just breast strokes and back strokes "
772," When I was 4, I once told my parents a man was dancing funny. When I described him, my parents realized it was a deceased uncle (that I had never known) of my dad I was seeing. No way I could have seen a picture either "
773," My PT recommended swimming, works great for building up strength too "
774," Support stockings are useful to a lot of people (I have not tried it, since my GP and pediatrician both think they are only for old people...SMH) "
775," My cat LOVES belly rubs. If he exposes belly and I do not rub, loud noises will make sure that my attention is on his beautiful belly "

For me it is mostly the headaches that significantly decreased "
778, Thanks 
779," Yep. 2nd biggest in our equivalent of a state.

The surrounding villages (what you would probably include in the suburbs) have a lot too.

I am dutch, so yeah. Small country, small cities "
780, True. Certainly food for thought 
781," I am not sore at all, if my PT had not told me I was tight I never would have known. Otherwise I would totally agree with you.

I go because I chronically hyperventilate (presumably because of POTS), not for my hypermobility or tight muscles, just to be clear. "
782, I wish I could just switch off my disability. However one bad night and I am bebound for the following 3 days basically. 
783, We haven't found a way to contact them unfortunately 
784, Thanks for your contribution 
785, Certainly something to think about. Thank you for your opinion 
786," My physical therapist told me that my neck muscles are abnormally tight. She said for some people it is normal.

My previous physical therapist tried relaxing my neck muscles and for a while after, my shoulders were super unstable. Was this a coincidence or are my neck muscles assisting my shoulder muscles in keeping everything in place? "
787, Thank you for your judgement 
788," That is a good idea, we just have no idea how to get into contact with this organization (nothing on the website or letter) "
789," I want my community to have events, just not at 8pm at night. We have gladly participated in decorating for things like soccer tournaments, we host multiple neighbourhood barbecues a year. My parents decided on this neighbourhood for multiple reasons, and the sense of community in the street was one of them.

This is not for the community though. This event is open to everyone (my city has 50k inhabitants, but this is open to people from other towns and cities too). I do not feel it is my responsibility to decorate for people that I feel no connection to (because I have never met most of them) "
790, A knife 
791," Thanks for confirming, that's what I thought! "
792, Thanks 
793, Thank you for the advice 
794," Quite great, but that is where the problem lies. Most of my neighbours are in their 70s, so we do not want to ask them (because they will probably say yes but over ask themselves in the process, which has happened before) "
795, What have you tried so far? 
796, Just entered my final year of high school 
797," There is no contact info on the letter so I doubt they will want to know, but we might go ask for help with getting the car parked somewhere "
798, Thanks. We hope so too 
799, Thank you for your judgement 
800," Good one, we will try that! "
801, Thank you. Exactly my thought 
802, Thank you for your judgement 
803," We would totally allow them to decorate if they asked.

Problem with the car is that everywhere around us it will cost us money to park the car (we have an exemption to park in front of our house, but that one holds no value outside of our street). Otherwise we would do that of course "
804, We would allow that for sure. We just do not want to do it ourselves 
805," Thank you for your answer! To be honest there will probably be a lot of drunk people regardless and google tells us it wont start until 8pm (but we still do not know what time they will be here, although with 3000 people participating it wont be a quick in, quick out) "
806, Thank you for your answer! 
807," I know nothing about your specific condition, just in general.

As far as I know, an ECG will be clear in POTS patients. Remember POTS is not a heart condition, it is neurological (although since the results of this neurological syndrome lie in blood vessels cariologists can be of a lot of help).

Edit: those 2 things that are incompetent are both valves in the heart between the upper and lower chambers (if you hadnt used google already to figure that out) "
808," It might look that way, but it is not. 

Lets take equation (a+b)(c+d)

FOIL would give us ac+ad+bc+bd

Factorization would give us a(c+d)+b(c+d), which also leads to ac+ad+bc+bd

Facorization might not be easiest now, but once you get to equations in the form of (q+r+s)(f+g+h), foiling is no longer possible. Just be aware the option exists "
809," (X+3)^2 is the same as (x+3)*(x+3), not the same as x+3*x*3.

For (x+3)*(x+3), you can use foil (first, outer, inner, last) or you can use factorization (x*(x+3)+3*(x+3))

Does that answer your question? "
810," The correct term would be to multiply both sides by -1, but yes you can drop the negative signs at both sides "
811," 3x-2x=-2, not positive 2

You are right for the first part. However with the variable, you forget to treat it like a normal number. Let me work out the last part. 

2x=3x-2

2x-3x=3x-3x-2

-x=-2

X=2 "
812," The rules say you should always give your answer as x= or y= (or whatever other variable), not -x=. Your answer does not have to be positive though, as long as your x is.

6-4=3x-2x gives 2=x

2x-3x=4-6 gives -x=-2 gives x=2.

Now lets take a new equation, 3(2x+2)=5x+4

So 6x+6=5x+4 gives 6x-5x=4-6 gives x=-2. This is a correct sum, yet your answer is negative. Your x however is positive (since it says x= and not -x=)

It does not matter what sides you do what or what you subtract or add. It just depends on your personal preference "
813," Honestly it doesn't matter on which side it is, but usually the x-terms are on the left side.

6-4= 3x-2x is the same as 3x-2x=6-4.

Same if you would switch how you do it.

2x-3x=4-6 is the same as 3x-2x=6-4 (as in, it will give you the same result). If you multiply both sides of the first equation by - 1, you get your answer.

You can play with numbers, as long as you make the same operation of both sides of the equal sign "

817," I am going into 12th grade and got sick midway through 11th. I am not US, and repeating a grade is not uncommon here. I needed to do all tests last year well to not repeat.

I made summaries (or got some of the internet, or did practice exams) when I was not brainfogged. Then I recorded me speaking the summary (or practice exercise). Then once brain fog set in, I would just listen to the summary. Sure it might not have been most effective, but it sure did help.

For recalling, that was a bit harder. Mostly doing the tests in the mornings (when I had the least amount of brain fog) in a private room with the lights off, unlimited water during the test and feet elevated. I don't know what the options for you are.

Good luck, never stop chasing your dreams! "
818, I always assumed I was mishearing them and they actually said I've seen. Guess I was wrong 
819, Dont. Might save your life someday 
820," For B, you can also add the 2/3 hour and 2/5 hour you found earlier instead of using minutes and converting back to kmph. Depending on your strenghts, that might be quicker and easier (you should understand both ways to do it though!) "
821, Same with airplanes. Similar experience 
822," Yep, shorts and a sleeveless top for me "
823, What monitor do you use? 
824," So I am from the northern part of the Netherlands. Frisian is a language we speak over here. I was raised primarily dutch, but I do know frisian. In this one instance, I thought this frisian word was Dutch and it ended up with a laugh.

So me and 2 of my exclusively Dutch friends were at an amusement park (in the town where my friends lived) a few summers ago. There were a lot of stinging bugs around. A stinging bug is called a 'neefje' in frisian. A 'neefje' is a nephew in Dutch. 

So one of those little bastards stung me. I told my friends a 'neefje' stung me and they started laughing. I had no idea why, in my head I had said a very normal sentence.

Yeah, 'neefje' doesn't seem to be the Dutch word for a stinging bug. In fact, there is no word for a stinging bug in Dutch (aside from the literal translation of stinging bug)

My friends still use the word from time to time, guess frisian is quite an handy language! "
825," Yeah, quite sure it had a stinger. There are a lot in this room and DEET ain't helping that much. 

 It's a kind I seem to be allergic to too (very huge, very hard, egg like stings that make the skin burst open and will be swollen for a week or 2. I have been meaning to go to a doctor with it, but I haven't gotten to that yet), so I was kind of freaking out. Still alive without any shortness of breath though, so all good already.

Thanks for the reassurance "
826," Oof, thanks "
827," All your y-intercepts are right

For the first one, your solutions are right but you wrote it down wrong. However you factored out 2x. That will make your 18 become a 9 (18/2=9). On a test, a simple mistake like that makes you lose points, be aware.

Edit: you are also missing x=0 as a solution in this first one.

The second one is completely correct.

For the third one, I will work it out. Just click one first and use it as a hint though.

!x^3 -3x^2 +2x=0!

!x(x^2 -3x+2x)=0!

!x=0 or x^2 -3x+2x=0!

!x=0 or (x-1)(x-2)=0! "
828," If you feel like you cannot trust them anymore, cut for sure. Your kid is there for many hours per week, and that will only increase as time goes on.

I do not know what she missed out on, but scheduling is bad in general, across all gyms. As long as your daughter is safe and mostly happy, I would stay put for now. The big gyms might be more succesful, but it sounds like this gym feels like a family. That is a hard thing to find in a big gym.

Good luck to you and your daughter! "
829,  
830," I feel like normal tired is the feeling of not being able to open your eyes, while the fatigued sick part comes in when my body and mind are tired instead of just my muscles. Fatigue feels deeper, so to say "
831," I have very frequent subluxating shoulders too. I wear a sling with me at all times. When the pain gets bad or it is really unstable, I put it on. I have it set in such a height that when my shoulder relaxes, it is still high thus can't slip out (my shoulder subluxes straight down basically. Might not work if you sublux another way).

After a full dislocation, a sling 24/7 for 7 days works to keep it stable for a bit.

Edit: not to discourage you, but I did physical therapy (not sure if it is the same as physiotherapy) after my first full luxation last year, and it made my shoulder super unstable. According to my physical therapist, that is normal in some cases. My exercises did not strengthen my muscles (they were already strong), they just worn them out "
832," Oh, my PCP has no POTS knowledge. I am his first patient who is diagnosed with it. I will bring it up with my pots dr in october for sure. "
833, Thank you for answering. Guess my PCP will be of no use then 
834," Not sure about elite, but we always recommended the girls do not wear underwear at all. At age 6, usually nobody does, at age 12 or so half of them do wear and half do not. I expect elite gymnasts either wear high cut, skin colored briefs or none at all "
835," I will definitely bring it up next time I get there. Until then, at least I know it is nothing serious. Thank you for your advice "
836," I have been lowering on carbs, but I strongly dislike veggies so it has not been going great. I do not believe it is totally carbs. For example, I do not get this when eating pizza, but I do get it after pasta.

I do eat dinner in 2 servings, so I will eat half my dinner at 5pm and half at 7pm, this has worked for the nausea but not the sweating.

I am on domperidone for nausea, and dumping syndrome sounds a lot like what that is supposed to do, could that be the cause? "

We will keep trying, thank you for being so helpful! Our current rabbit is so different than our old rabbit, it is like reinventing the wheel from time to time "
865," Abhasra picks up 40 in 12 hours, that means she picks up 40/12 per hour. Natalie pickus up 40 in 9 hours, that means she picks up 40/9 per hour. They need to pick up 40. Combining that into an equation gives us

!(40/12)*x+(40/9)*x=40!

!(10/3)*x+ (40/9)*x=40!

!30x+40x=360!

!70x=360!

!X=360/70 = 36/7!

!That comes down to approximately 5,14, which is 5 hours and 8 minutes! "
866," He eats a lot of hay! Our vet did tell us indeed that we had to watch his poop, as soon as he got softer poop we needed to limit pellets.

To be honest I do not think he eats much more than what you suggested, although I never really measured it. I usually give a little less than half a handfull in the mornings and just enough to keep it at that level at night.

I will start the simple veggies though! Are there places where you can buy these (other than the supermarket)? We do not eat most of us ourselves so it would be a waste to throw out the excess after the rabbit eats from it "
867," Ok, will try. Thanks! "
868," Wow, thank you for all the resources! We got him when he was 11.5 weeks and started introducing veggies short after, but like I said it has not caught onto him yet. Our previous rabbit ate veggies like crazy so we have no idea what we are doing wrong in that he will not eat them.

Our vet recommended unlimited pellets until they are 3 months though, any idea why that would be? He is a color dwarf (also called Netherland dwarf rabbit) and he was 850 grams at our checkup this friday (poor thing caught an eye infection, we are treating it now) "
869," So our rabbit (14 weeks of age) does not eat veggies. We have tried carrots (also the top part), cucumber and paprika. Dislikes all of it.

He does like dried banana and coconut, but those contain a lot of sugar (and potassium for the banana) so we do not want to give that more than twice a week.

He eats hay and feed (those brown little sticks), but internet recommends 100g of veggies a day.

What are some other veggies we can try and is it bad if he does not get his veggies? "
870, Newspaper delivery and baby/petsitting are common jobs for 13 year olds around here

872," I do not notice I am hyperventilating, so I do not think it is air hunger. It just happens. Officially it is chronic hyperventilation. It is mostly me breathing very deep, quick and high.

I do not hyperventilate just upright, also laying down. I get less symptomatic when I control my breathing laying down vs sitting up. Laying down, I can keep it under control for 4 minutes or so before losing feeling in my legs, sitting up it is after about 2 minutes.

Guess a sleep study is the way to go then "

875," When I was in 6th grade, we went to cut down small trees with saws. We were supposed to do it in couples. However my couple decided they would rather work alone than work with me, so I was stuck without gloves. All went well, until I went to hang up the saw (something we were supposed to do without gloves) and I cut my hand.

I then got yelled on for getting hurt because I should have been wearing gloves (although we only got 1 pair per partner and my partner took them, and they had no more. When I did nothing, I got yelled at too)

Since then, I have refused to cut down any trees ever "
876," See if you can move part of your work from evenings to mornings. For the 10 page packet, do 5 pages at night and 5 in the morning.

I am not in college but my high school sounds pretty damn similar, and that is a huge help to me.

Also working while eating lunch or dinner from time to time is not a bad idea. "
877," Not sure it would be a rash thing. It seems like you have thought it through. Life is too short to do things that make you unhappy.

879," Just trying to teach you something, it is called substitution in English "
880," First off, this is all from my own experience.

I know this is not what you want to hear, but time is all that helps. 

I grew up with a chronically ill parent (my mom has MS). It took me until age 9 or 10 to accept that I was not going to be the one who could cure MS, that I could not help my mom. Once I realized that, I cried for days straight. I still worry about her and I do have a different relationship to my mom than I see other kids have relationships with their mothers (I am usually her primary caregiver and I worry about her a lot). I am fine with that, my mom feels like she ruined my childhood (not true obviously)

But they are gonna be OK. For them, being ill all your life is just not something they can grasp yet. It will get better. 

I would encourage you to let them in on the process. Let them go to doctors appointments with you (once they are old enough). When they are a bit older, encourage them to find other kids with moms who have POTS. Encourage them to find information on your own, and make it clear that you are always there for them to talk about it. I know my school always had us do presentations, and my presentation about MS made everything just so much clearer. "
881," I use a combipill. I did have some side effects the first 2 months or so, but my periods were so much worse. When I did have my period, I would use naproxen. Got side effects from that too but again, far less worse than my period. 

Naproxen is not a miracle drug though, I went from laying curled up in a ball to laying straight. Still could not get out of bed. But it is worth a shot. "
882, I always wake up early. Yeah I might go to sleep at 8pm but 5am to 7am are mine 
883, Amazing to hear! 
884," Normal, however for me it happens about once a week (as opposed to the general once every few months). As long as there is no loss of vision and only minimal pain at the moment it bursts, it is benign (according to my doctor) "

Although there seems to be this general statement that teenagers dislike math (and school in general). I just really find math a beatiful thing "
904," I have and she has talked to him previously. It just does not seem to stick. 

Weirdly enough he takes about every symptom (tachycardia, nausea, headaches etc) serious, just not the brain fog part. I still think that is because he has never experienced such a thing. "
905," Combinatronics are not something I have encountered (I have taken the algebra/calculus/trigenometry math class), but a quick google search seems interesting. I love calculus and algebra. The imaginary part, that what we cannot encounter in the world yet still exists, that is what interests me. Things like infinity or imaginary numbers "
906," I am 16, my next appointment is in october, but it is with a new doctor. 

I do not like taking my dad to doctors appointments however. He is a typical helicopter parent and last time I took him (last year, so I was 15), I did not actually talk until the doctor told him to shut up. I like doing my own story, I think it helps the doctor understand it and it helps with him trying to see my level, so they do not talk to me like I am a child (i have quite a lot of medical knowledge).

Maybe it is best to take him sometime, but that will take a bit unfortunately. I could ask my mom but I do not want to cause a fight between them "
907," Physics is not my thing for the practical side, but I adore the math that it involves. i love math in general "
908," Almost true. Cos (45 degr) = sin (45 degr) is a common one, but not the only one "
909," Great!

Edit; dont forget to change the flair to answered "
910," Okay, lets go back to that first equation I gave you earlier

Sin(a)= cos((pi/2)-a)

Now lets take our previous knowledge about complimentary angles

A+b=pi/2 means that a=(pi/2)-b

Lets substitute it all into the question

So for sin (a)= cos (b) that means 

cos ((pi/2)-(pi/2)-b) =cos (b)

Cos (-b)= cos (b)

We know cos (-a)= cos (a), so then cos (b) must equal cos (b)

Making it true.

Is that clearer? "
911," A and B are complementary, so a+b=pi/2 (assuming we are doing radials)

Can you work it out from there? "
912," Sin(a)= cos((pi/2)-a)

So for sin (a) to equal cos (a), cos ((pi/2)-a) should equal cos (a). This leads to (pi/2)-a=a+2kpi or (pi/2)-a=2pi-a +2kpi. That second one has the -a=-a cancel out, so we are going forward with the first one.

(Pi/2)-a=a +2kpi

(Pi/2)-2kpi=2a

A=((pi/2)-2kpi)/2

Work that out and you get your solution "
913," Netherlands, small city with not too many tourists though. Cannot speak for the situation in Amsterdam, as I have never been there before (aside from Schiphol) "
914," I hope so too! At 16 and looking relatively healthy (super pale but that is it) it is very hard. I have not had much to fight with doctors (except for medication, and they will not budge), but the fighting with school is harder (although from other stories I still feel lucky). 

The doctor I am seeing in october has published about POTS and is not scared to prescibe medication (as far as I have heard), so just dragging along until it is that time. First real tilt table test too probably (was diagnosed with a poor mans tilt table test), so quite nervous but also quite exciting "
915," Thanks! I do have a diagnosis now and I will probably start medication in october (my current doctors do not want to prescibe me medications because those are for old people, I call bullshit).

I guess I was seeing ghosts then, thank you for your information

Edit: I did mostly ask because at the time they seemed like nothing, but looking back I want to know if I could have known sooner. Guess I could not "
916," Most places, you can ask for free tap water. It is not on the menu but if you ask, most places do not care (at least all the ones I have been to) "
917, Thank you for your answer 
918," So the last few days have been hot, and my brain fog is really severe. I can hear people talk, and I just cannot process what they say. I cannot think straight.

My dad thinks I am making it all up. He says I do not want to hear them and that I am doing this because I am lazy. I am not, I really hate being this dependant on others.

I know he thinks this way because he does not understand. What is a situation that is similar that healthy people understand? How do you explain brain fog? "
919, So you could have undiagnosed POTS without symptoms? 
920, I do not really feel like I needed a diagnosis back then (if I had it) because it did not bother me in day to day life. However now it does. My doctor told me it is too late for me to grow out of it unfortunately 
921," Handstand forward roll is a relatively easy B skill and can easily be connected to a cartwheel, handstand or walkover "
922, Thank you for your advice! 
923," I will for sure tell my physical therapist on Monday in our appointment. My doctor knows nothing about HSD, he leaves most of that to my physical therapist. If she thinks a scan or whatever is necessary she will tell me and my doctor for sure.

 If it was something worrysome I would have need to gone to the ER since our doctor is not open right now, but it seems like it could wait until Monday then "
924," It should give you those to cut them down yourself.

Best bet is to contact support "
925," Going against the stream, NAH

It might not have been the most tactful thing to say, but you were not an asshole for saying it. The kid is 16, he should be able to at least keep his emotions in check until he is home. Man up in public is not a strange thing. Not for boys, not for girls. This will not be the last time he loses, it is better to learn to deal with it now than later (example: when you maybe do not get the job. Better to keep a strong face and break down at home).

Again, I am not against crying. Crying in public however is not something I would ever accept if I had kids (and they were at an age where they would understand), and that is something I was raised with as well (yes, as a female) "
926," That seems great!

I have lost a lot of weight since developing POTS a few months back, so I do not think weight caused it. Also I have had it my entire life "
927," How many are significant? How much numbers give information?

For example, 0,0032 has 2 significant numbers, because 3,2*10^-3 is the exact same.

However in 1000 years there are 4 significant numbers. You could think that 1000 equals 1*10^3, but that does not give the same amount of information. 1*10^3 could equal 1003 of rounded that way. By leaving out the zeroes you leave out information about the accuracy "
928," I also like it because it is easy to understand, no matter the amount of knowledge of physics/ biology "
929," Thanks!

Edit: forgot helped "
930, No. They should not have employees. Lots of buisnesses do fine as a one mens buisness 
931, So a zebra can refer to anyone with a rare illness (not just EDS)? 
932," Simply said, the body is allergic to gravity. Blood goes down and the reflexes to get it back up do not work. If blood is in the legs, it is not in the hart and brain. Heart and brain panic because no blood equals no oxygen and that causes all sorts of problems "
933," I dunno, that was the reason given by school. Makes no sense to me either, but they will not budge "
934," I am not US. Our school has prohibited watches for all testing (not just standardized), because they are afraid of smart watches (according to them) "
935, Too bad watches are often not allowed either. Just kind of hope for the examinator to put a clock on a screen in front of the room or you can hope there is a clock in the classroom 
936, Meal switches are very easy to incorporate. Basically you take 1 unhealthy thing (like cookies) and swap it for something healthier (like mini tomatoes). You only swap 1 product at a time. This makes it easier to keep going 
937," I remembered reading somewhere that most forms of EDS were not recessive traits, which makes skipping generations a little less likely. Thank you for sharing your knowledge on medication though! "
938," I always secure it out to the side with a bandaid. Indeed hurts like hell, but it is the best I can manage. Since I cut them out every 3 or 4 days the bleeding has significantly decreased though "
939, That is the point. It is a mutation. I wanted to show an example where a gene mutation (in novo) was 'common' 
940, Thank you for your explanation! 
941," Oh, that must suck. I hope the surgery worked! "
942, It is huge though! 
943," Thanks for the tip, unfortunately they are not willing to do that on a minor (I am 16) "
944," Very true. However anatomy in ancient humans is barely comparable to us, so it would be a hard comparison. For example, our length has increased a lot recently because the back has straightened out.

I do think that in the early days there was more of a 'suck it up' culture; I do not think that people who had it back in the days would complain about it. Of course pain remedy was basically nonexistent either. It would not suprise me if early EDS sufferers would be the biggest alcoholics of all.

Of course that is all pure speculation "
945, Would you mind telling your 'care routine'? How often and how do you cut them? 
946," Me neither, grade 11 biology is the furthest my formal education goes. 

Of course chances are small but mutations still happen. Maybe the more rare types do have 1 ancestor, but for hEDS and the other common types yes, you can be the first in your family to get the mutation.

Things like downs syndrome work the same way. It can be heridatory, but it does not have to be. It could very well be just a 'mistake' in the DNA of a person "
947," Take it a step back. There is no rush. Your coach probably told you that too. You need to feel ready before you are. Otherwise maybe ask for a double spot? Can you do it standing? Back limber? Whatever you do, please discuss with your coach. A bad habit sneaks in in no time but is very hard to get out of your system "
948," Do you have a coach?

Teaching yourself a back handspring is a really bad idea "
949," Eastpack has many different types of shoulder bands, even if it does not seem like it. Just something to be wary of.

Same thing with the thing on top. Some are plastic, some are just fabric. "
950," A mutation can happen more than once. It is very well possible that at one point in time, it existed and later in history it did not. If a mutation could only form once, all EDS sufferers should be related (of course possible, but very unlikely) "
951," I hope this is not seen as medical advice. It is honestly just life advice, but people in r/advice probably do not have problems with this (maybe you all do not either, but asking never hurt anyone).

Also, HSD/ hEDS here. 

Are grown in toenails a part of all of this? I have had this problem since I was a baby. It just seems like my nails cannot grow long, just wide. 2 or 3 days after cutting my nails they are growing in again. By cutting them then I can kind of keep it under control, but not always (if they grow faster than usual)

Once they are fully grown in and I cut them out (like my PCP told me to do. If I do not do it, the pain is absolutely terrible) my nail will probably either partially fall off (staying attatched to the other grown in side. Just the top cm or 2 fall off) or it will rupture to the side, which makes the entire nail unstable too. Usually happens on my big toe, but sometimes the smaller ones as well.

I tried everything. Letting them grow, cutting daily, cutting round, cutting square, cutting very short, keeping quite a bit of white visible, cutting with a nailcutter, a nail scissor, a normal scissor and it just keeps on happening. I do not know how to fix this anymore "
952," I honestly do not know if EDS even existed then. It is a gene mutation, that could have happened at any point in time. They probably did not survive, I do not see how hunting or hard labour etc would be possible. If they survived, they probably did not have kids. A mutation like that would not have existed long in primal society IMO "
953," I have the opposite, i have not had any feelings of hunger since getting sick (around march). I once forgot to eat for 2 days straight, I now use alarms that remind me to eat.

Always hungry seems like no fun either though... "
954," Which one do you currently have?

My eastpack killed my back until I put the shoulder straps a little looser, making the bag lower on my back. Also always wearing it on both shoulders (unless there was a (sub) luxation, then I only wear it on my good shoulder) "
955," That does sound amazing, however Apple is just not my thing. I like me some android "
956, Must be US-based 
957, You have the same standard for every school in the entire country. That is a pretty big plus IMO. It is just one huge stamdarized test (which for elementary school the US seems to have no problems with) 
958," Good for you for trying to get independent!

My dad is one of those typical helicopter parents, luckily my mom can keep him in check most of the time. I have had the S7 mini (I think, might have been S6 mini) before my current phone and I had no problems other than the battery that died on me after about 2.5 years. No camera issues though. 

I honestly didn't know nokia had smartphones! I will look into those "
959, They have not decided yet as far as I know. That's why a new Chinese phone just feel like unnecessary risk to me 
960," Okay, thank you for your answer! "
961," Only half a lie though. If you don't have anything to hide, you have nothing to fear from a police search "
962, This made me laugh. Kids can be the greatest ever 
963, The weather 
964," We (Netherlands) have a leaving exam too, but there are 2 chances to re sit if you are sick during the first one. Those 2 moments are standardized throughout the country though. Sitting them right after surgery is just...wow "
965," I don't really mind the more expensive thing to be honest (I have about 900 euros saved up, but the less it costs the better of course). I don't want a huawei again (or any Chinese brand for that matter) because of the threats google has made concerning espionage. I really like Android so a phone without android is a no no for me. Also big screens are not for me. Thank you for all the info though! 

What problems did you encounter, if I may ask? "
966, Thanks! 
967, Thanks! With the recent huawei vs Google espionage debate I am not willing to go for a Chinese brand again. I don't want a phone that cannot run android 
968," That's great! As my PCP explained it (in kid terms, I am 16 but they often act like we are small kids still, it's Ok) that our body uses so much energy because the heartrate is so high, that anything extra is too much for all systems to handle so they start to 'crash'. When a normal body has to twice as hard, ours have to work maybe 6 or 8 times as hard just to keep everything going. 

Makes sense to me now, but I would never have thought of that on my own. "
969," I am due for my meningococcal vaccine soon, but I (together with my PCP and parents) decided to hold off, at least until I can see a POTS specialist. Luckily herd immunity exists for until then. Hope you feel better soon! "
970," 30*= 16 * 7 + 0.5 * a * (7^2 )

Not sure it is easier, but 18/20 seems right. You decide what you find easier "
972," My PCP told me they always want to hear more than less. Some things will be dismissed as normal, but a tiny detail that might seem like nothing to you can be huge to them. Please tell them "
973," 25k-11k=14k. You pay 8% for everything between 11k and 25k

Edit: for what you have left, you just take the rate for that what is left. In your case, 12% on 21.something K

Edit 2: see it like tea. Your annual salary is in the teapot. Your first cup has a rate of 0% and a volume of 11k. Once that one is full, you move to the next cup, which has an 8% rate and a volume of (25k minus 11k) 14k. My teacher explained it like that to me and it was so clear. I hope it helps you "
974," Yes! Water does not retain without electrolytes, and electrolytes will not be retained if you do not drink water with them. Its all a balancing game! "
975," I was diagnosed with a poor man TTT (lay 10 minutes, stand 10 minutes). If you can diagnose that way everything is good. However some patients already have coping mechanisms, like standing with tightening leg muscles (or so I have been told)

My doctor was like that as well. Physical therapy should fix it, according to them. They got very angry and dismissive as soon as we asked at other treatment, like eating more salt and drinking more water. They would only prescribe anti depressants because obviously I have anxiety as well (/s). My PCP has told me he does not believe that at all, and neither do I.

Good luck in your appointment in a few months! "
976," There are therapists that specialize in the connection between mind and body. I am going to see one soon. Maybe you can find something similar?

Make sure it is not a normal specialist though, they will probably say your POTS Is in your head, while it is not. This is a physical condition. However being chronically ill and having to deal with not being able to trust your body, there are therapists who specialize in that "
977," I got (0,015 ; 0,06 ; 1), although I did not use the method your teacher wanted you to use (I was never taught that, just substitution and reduction, which is what I used to get this result) "
978," I was responding to u/LordJiraiya. He said his gf doesn't need to worry about the bc pill anymore. Not responding to OP, just to OC "
979," You cannot possibly forget to take an IUD, while you can forget your pill "
980," Equal to the y-value. I made it equal to the y-vaule (1) first, then moved it to the left side of the =-sign to keep some overview.

You use the standard formula and you fill in the values you know "
981," It is solvable. I made a little mistake in my first explanation, (-4)^2 is of course 16 and not -16. Does it work then? "
982," I feel like you are overthinking this.

Lets take the first point, (-4,1). The formula was y= ax^2 + bx +c. The x-value is -4, the y-value is 1. Filling this in gives

1=a*(-4)^2 +b*-4 +c

1= -16a-4b+c

-16a-4b+c-1=0

A,b and c are your 3 variables "
983, I often get confused with how the L looks for some reason 
984," I sleep 8pm to 5:30am quite standard, but the more frequent I wake up during the night the worse I feel. Sleeping through the night is my nemesis "
985, Smart one! I find the L trick quite confusing too 
986," Reading direction is a good one!

I mainly need it for physics (righthand rules), economics (shifting of lines) and biology (location of organs), but other subjects sometimes ask for it too "
987," I have no other signs of dyslexia(no trouble reading at all, I was always a few grade levels above my own. Even now I am very good at efficiently and precisely reading), so that's not really any reason to get tested. It often happens with people who do not have one clear dominant hand and I have never had problems with it before, just my finals will be a bitch if I cannot figure it out in a minute or so

Happy cake day! "
988, Thanks! 
989," Well yes, but those are all recent and have a clear cause. Left and right is something I have been struggling with since kindergarten (where we were supposed to learn it but I never really did) "
990," I get it with bandaids. Havent had tape, but i assume the same adhesives are used in both "
991," I have a hole in my eardrum that probably got there because it never healed after getting tubes (HSD here). About 20dB loss in that ear. About 10dB in the other ear, no idea why that "
992," If A doubles and B stays constant, C doubles. You can try it with some numbers if you are unsure, just never write those on a test.

Example

C1= 5/10 =0,5

C2= 10/10=1

1/0,5=2, so C has doubled "
993, How do you do those hiding things? 
994," Chest pain is a lack of oxygen to the heart. In POTS, the heart (and brain) does not get enough blood in a standing position, which can cause palpitations and chest pain "
995," Broth works well for extra salt. I take about 1 cup every 2 days because it makes me very full and it contains very little calories (I need the calories, I have already lost over 10kg while sick, even though my previous weight was totally healthy) "
996, It is still worth getting it diagnosed! 
997," As a fellow invisible illness sufferer, damn what a b****. Invisible illnesses really suck "
998," I have a hole in my eardrum too, but since it is only a small hole the doctors are not willing to do anything about it (despite pain and hearing loss). Hope you can figure it out "
999," It can? My parents always encouraged it. Ah well, I now play snake on my graphic calculator. I upgraded.

I am still just quiet and respectful towards the teacher. I respond when they ask a question and all that "
1000," I always ask my dad. He is the most inflexible person I know. My mom is also hypermobile (no diagnosis) and she has MS, so asking her is not really an option (since I still do not know). If my dad does not have it, it is safe to assume it is not normal "
1001," Damn, I never get those kinds of people. I skipped a grade in elementary school and was still bored of my mind. My parents specifically told school they did not want an IQ test done, because they felt like a label would do no good.

However I not once thought about acting out. I just kind of read all day "
1002," Sure, I will Pm my email adress to you "
1003," Oh, that sucks. Glad to hear I am not crazy for my pronounciation though! "
1004, Creative doctors right there!

1008," You cannot say for sure that the top angle is 45 degrees. You could if this was a square, but we do not know if this is a square or a rectangle "
1009, I cannot access the link 
1010," Yeah, thats the benefit I have in not being in an english-speaking country. Pots is not a word here. I can totally see that scenario play out though "
1011, Good one too. Great to hear I am not totally insane for pronouncing it like that 
1012," Yeah, best thing I could come up with. At least you got what I meant.

You pronounce it like that too? "
1013, Thank you for your answer! 
1014, Thank you for your answer. I found the P O T S very weirdly sounding too. Guess I am sticking to pots (and pans) 
1015," For the fitbit, that is just in the app right? On screen is your actual heartrate? Otherwise I am in trouble...the screen shows over 130 easily when standing "
1016," I went to my PCP. He referred me. Referral was denied, so he diagnosed me with on the hypermobility spectrum (bascially the same as hEDS but without the need of a specialist, as he explained it to me) right then and there. A PCP is exactly trained for these kind of things. Explain why you think you have it, then hear him/her out. "
1017," Good one! I have a similar tag on my bag, it gives me a little piece of mind "
1018," Oh okay. My english is not the best, and it did mention something about higher rates of depression. Not that the entire study is about that, but part of it was.

There are multiple studies out there that show depression amongst chronically ill patients is higher, related to lower quality of life. I think because POTS is such a massive disease with such a wide variety in severness, it is safe to say POTS patients (at least some) can fall under those studies as well.

One of the more recent ones for chronic ill and depression: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768533/ "
1019," Mmm, havent passed out before. The doctors who diagnosed me cannot and will not treat me so I am at a standstill. A name on my symptoms does help to get accomodations at school for sure! "

1021," I have not done the real tilt table yet, but was diagnosed with a poor mams tilt table test. They were not even looking for POTS, the doctors just happened to have an american intern who knew about it.

Getting a real tilt table test to find out how severe it actually is soon though. With the poor mans, i had an increase of 51BPM "
1022," No, not common here. In fact I have never gone to the doctor with the flu. Usual rule of thumb is after a week or as soon as you cannot trust youself anymore for adults. A bit shorter for kids. IV treatment here also means getting admitted to the hospital, so it is fairly uncommon "
1023," I read it a while ago, I will see if I can find it "
1024, Netherlands! 
1025," It is quite amazing! No double testing, no explaining diseases (most doctors will read your file before the appointment, and I also have a rare skin disease completely seperate from POTS), no forgetting allergies. I cannot imagine going without it "
1026," Ah, more difference in culture. No way you would get fluids for something like a stomach flu, unless you are almost dying.

It is very easy because most doctors read your file beforehand. No explaining conditions, no double testing (all test results are in there too), no forgetting allergies. It is all available right there on their computer "
1027," I totally get it. Maybe it is that here every person has a file shared between all doctors that have seen and will see you. If you say you have an illness, a doctor can easily look in your file. I assume that is not the case in the US? "
1028," Ah, someone else who can never weave the word helped into a sentence "
1029," I do notice that trend on here. Luckily in real life, not so much.

I kind of have a double feeling about it. On the one side, more awareness could be a good thing. However if it goes as far as celiac has, that is not a good thing at all.

I personally had not heard of POTS before getting diagnosed. Guess I am on exactly the other extreme end "
1030," POTS in itself does not impact it. However if you faint when you should not, that is obviously not a good idea. Comorbid conditions could impact it. Also, depression (and therefor suicide) is higher in POTS patients than in our healthy counterparts. "
1031, Can you cook or bake? 
1032," I have usually consumed a liter of water or so before breakfast, i also keep breakfast small and simple (1 cracker and a glass of milk or something similar) "
1033," I forgot socks, helped! "
1034," Thanks, helped. I have everything you mentioned, guess i am good to go! "
1035," I used standard everything. I am very sensitive to different textures though, so maybe it is just me "
1036," Thanks, helped. Mostly rain but we have a cottage right next to the center of the vacation park, so not much time spend outside. "
1037," I tried both. 

Ice cream on pancake was quite great actually but the hot and cold combo made me feel like I was commiting a crime.

Peanut butter jelly sandwich was just no combination. The different structures almost made my mouth explode, and not in a good way "
1038," Ice cream on pancakes.

And in my european mind, peanut butter jelly sandwiches seem like a huge crime (but all americans on here will downvote me for sure) "
1039," Happy birthday, enjoy the day with your family! "

1042," My personal belief is that you should see a doctor when you get a new symptom. I get however why you want to try it this way. Just gently reminding you we are no experts, nor do we pretend to be.

My gramdmother does get the sleepy head thing as an aura before a migraine, maybe that is it? Does it get better when she lays down?

Please see a physical therapist about movement. Cardio and strenght are very important but it does not sound safe to exercise without direct supervision (especially the fainting worries me, in combination with EDS that could lead to some nasty injuries) "
1043," My favorite TV show without a doubt is Dexter. Greys anatomy and black mirror complete my top 3.

For movies, I keep coming back to the divergent series. I really liked the great gatsby too, and a christmas carol makes that top 3 complete. "
1044," I want to hear about a small thing that made you happy today!


For me it happened this morning in an animal store. There was this girl of about 3 years old. She was there with her dad, and she looked a bit bored while playing with some tractor toys that the store had out. I was standing in the lane right next to the play table, minding my own buisness. This little girl gives me a tap on my back and tells me she just got new shoes. They had lights in it. I loved seeing her be so enthousiastic about it! I think she told me about them for 5 minutes. Afterwards the dad apologized, but I told him that was not necessary. I just really enjoyed this conversation with this small, enthousiastic girl. "
1045," First off: I am not an native English speaker.

Next year I have to read 4 books for english. I thought I was smart to start over summer, but I have no idea what to read! Last year I read macbeth and a christmas carol. I enjoyed both of those, but especially macbeth was quite hard to read.

Our school does not have mandatory books, just a mandatory writers list : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1agDSuqTUKrAV7dsWF8N_XjCPJW7VbuDf . At least 3 out of my 4 books have to be of writers on that list.

I like crime and sensation books (think CSI, james bond etc.). Any good book recommendations? No required length but as short as possible is my own preference since I use audiobooks (and they tend to be very lengthy anyways).

Edit: forgot to add the books are not allowed to be in a series (so no harry potter or game of thrones etc.) "
1046,  
1047,  
1048," First time posting here! This happened over 20 years ago. I am only 16, I totally got this story from my parents.

We had a lot of snails in our garden at the time. They were eating at our plants and my parents looked online at what to do. One thing they found was to put beer in the backyard, so they did. They were very desperate to get the snails out.

Anyway they kept this up for 2 or 3 days until our cat Famke (fun substory: Famke means girl in my language. The cat was a male, my parents didn't know at the time they named her) comes in. He is meauwing, he is falling over, he is throwing up, he is just clearly not well. 

My parents panicked. They almost went to the vet. Before going, my mom was going to get their outside pillows cleaned up, it was supposed to rain later that day and they had no idea how long they would be gone. While she did that, she happened to look over to one of the cups of beer. It was not very full anymore. So she looked at the next cup. Half empty too. All cups were only half full. My mom connected a sick cat and a lot of missing beer and she told my dad. 

They called the vet. My parents asked if cats could get drunk. Doctor said he really did not know but if they thought he was drunk, to monitor and if it got worse to call again. In one or two weeks the cat was back to normal. My parents obviously cleaned out the beer very very fast.

And the cat? He lived happily ever after. He died when I was about 6 months old. It was a tough guy. "
