0," I try to avoid being in a situation where I need an uber, but sometimes its inevitable. I leave the driver a 20 when they drop me off, which is usually around the same as the fare. Its not a perfect solution since its still supporting the company, but I cant think of what else to do. "
1, why? 
2," Its different depending on where youre from, but Im Australian and I just had to tell my GP that I thought I had ADHD and why, she then gave me a referral to a psychiatrist, and he asked me what I had been doing to deal with my symptoms and basically decided that I had already been doing everything that he would get a patient to try before going on meds, so he gave me a script for 30mg of vyvanse that same day. "
3," as a lesbian whos type seems to be straight girls, i share your pain "
4, what? veggie sushi is the best! 
5, Take a shot every time I say Wella lol sorry 
6," I was planning to bleach my hair with Wella blondor powder mixed with Wella colour charm 20 volume developer, and then tone it with the same developer and Wella T35 colour charm toner, but I just realised that I only have enough developer to tone. I dont want to pay another $9 for shipping to order some more, and I cant find anywhere that stocks Wella developer in store near me, but since its just for bleach, does the brand really matter? "
7, I know lol 
8," sorry for stalking your post history, but i too have an Erectile Dysfunction, and if youre parents know, it is a very valid reason not to donate blood. "
9," Even if its rarely, you still do them! Which means you already know how, so it shouldnt be too hard to do it more often :) "
10," I know... Its just hes not the greatest with emotional support type stuff, and I find it *so* hard to be vulnerable and open up, so I feel like me crying is just a recipe for a really uncomfortable time for everyone. Whereas if I could just keep it in, and have control over what Im saying, then we might actually be able to have a productive conversation about what I should be doing "
11," youre totally right lmao I completely forgot that fiction is a thing. The notes are just for papers and journals, but now that you mention it Ive also recently figured out how to get my brain to take in novels too; I just download the audiobook and go for a really fucking long nature walk. It has to be in the bush because otherwise ill get distracted and do something else, but trails are uneventful enough to keep me focused on the book, yet engaging enough to fend off intrusive thoughts "
12," I *have* to take notes when I read, its literally the only way I can retain information. I think its partly because its lets me outsource my memory, but also because it forces me to focus on the text, and since Im already doing 2 things at once, my mind doesnt have as much room to wander. "
13, [glebe!](http://www.sapphobooks.com.au) 
14," Thats actually basically the half of year 10 english syllabus now, and I dont think thered be any value in extending it any further because you can only get so much from that exercise, the answers always going to be some sort of rendition of different sources have different biases. Analysing something as abstract as poetry gives students room to be creative and personal with their interpretations, and allows teachers to explore a much larger range of ideas and concepts.

EDIT: I do agree that the way english is taught at the moment is not the best for students, but I think the solution is in giving students more freedom and independence in what and how they study (the extension 1 and 2 courses would be a great framework) and actually communicating *why* studying english is important, because its super understandable why so many people have the same opinion as you, and coming into class with that mindset really hinders what youre going to be capable of "
15," You analyse poetry to develop skills in critical thinking and analysis. The medium itself may be pretty useless in day-to-day life, but thats not the point. 

Its like how math is to develop your ability to problem solve. Memorising the cosine rule doesnt actually matter, but understanding when and how to apply it trains your brain to operate in a way which allows you to excel in so many aspects of academic and personal life "
16," Yeah, I get that its supposed to show that some students have the ability to synthesise any given analysis on the spot, but in making it so specific, the kids without those skills can hardly even attempt the question. And those kids without the skills arent even necessarily bad at english, they just take a different approach. If it were the case that good english students could bullshit an analysis on the spot, extension 2 wouldnt be a year long major work. "
17," Yeah sorry, youre right and it was really distasteful of NESA especially considering the author didnt know her work was going to be included. I hadnt actually had a real look at the question itself and my opinion was just based on the reactions Id seen from people at the time, who seemed to be more concerned with the fact they had to analyse a vague text, and that it was written by an aboriginal woman (from the sexist/racist attacks on twitter/hsc discussion groups) "
18," I used to be a cashier before I had an ED and whenever I saw thin people buy heaps of junk
food Id just assume it was for a girls night type thing or a post-breakup one off binge "
19," Shit sorry I totally misread the exam question when I googled it, I 100% agree with you. Fuck though I hope theyve changed their approach with the new syllabus, based on the module statements though I wouldnt be surprised if it went either way. "
20," the entire point of the unit is understanding that texts can have different meanings depending on how theyre read. The thing about discovery was just an example of *one* possible reading, and if you have textual evidence, its just as valid as the the sexual assault interpretation "
21, because it allows them to distinguish whos at the top end of the cohort 
22," then you should lift with your legs, not your back "
23," Because as a huge dude, theres no danger in women seeing you as an object "
24," thanks for the recommendations, ill check them out :) "
25,"  ""let it all out - the more you hold in, the more alone you'll feel - if you talk to me I can help you carry the pain/hurt/burden.""

my dad always says a problem shared is a problem halved "
26, last time I had surgery I just filed my nails down so much that there was nothing left to pick with lol 
27,"  Brand social accounts posting memes really annoys me for some reason. Cant quite put my finger on why.

[sarah z](https://youtu.be/Z6bLq4466LM) and [hbomberguy](https://youtu.be/06yy88tLWlg) have great videos about brands on social media "
28," Sorry I should have specified, shell be able to return to work after talking time off to care for her baby, but in her previous position she would have been paid. I didnt really think of that as counting as maternity leave since casual employees (at least in my experience) can usually take large periods of time off pretty easily. "
29, Its absolutely disgusting 
30, This is in Australia 
31," I have never has a BMI above 19 or below 17, and I have lots of stretch marks. Dont pretend you have any clue what youre talking about. "
32," A typical student doesnt need those extra things to function to their full potential, but you do. Not having the allowance means you have to work harder to achieve the same results, and thats not fair. The goal of disability provisions is to minimise inequities, and since youre facing an inequity, youre using the services as intended and absolutely not taking advantage of them at all. "
33," 100% yes to the last part! Ive never really been shy or introverted but Ive always found small talk and talking to people outside of my age group sort of difficult, but now I work at a laser tag place and my job is basically just to explain the different types of games to everyone, and its ridiculously boosted my confidence and conversational abilities. I probably wont be working there for much longer (Im moving out for university in a year or two) and I hadnt even thought of volunteering as a replacement until your comment, but its a great idea! thank you! "
34, ...You're walking in the woods. There's no one around and your phone is dead 
35,  
36," Just reading what you said just snapped me back into a normalish headspace ahaha thank you. Here I was expecting my TDEE to drop to like 600, a number pulled completely out of my ass

In the complete absence of thyroid hormone, basal metabolic rate or resting energy expenditure could be re- duced by 30% or more [source](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/13102818.2005.10817207) 

Its only one source, so Ill look into it more later but according to this, in the absolute *worst* case scenario, my BMR would be 950-1050, and I do 2 hours of cardio a day so my TDEE would still be like ~1400, which is just about what I eat at the moment. Fuck thats a relief lol "
37, Did your TDEE change at any point? Some of these replies are really freaking me out ahahah 
38," Its so they can use this case as proof that cops are always punished accordingly, its so they can ignore hundreds of cases where cops walk away from murder without even a slap on the wrist "
39," I definitely wasnt planning on taking vyvanse on the same day, the reason Im curious though is because I didnt take it before the MDMA either, so I think my neurochemistry has changed since I started meds. And If thats the case Im trying to figure out if that means I cant have a pure experience of anything, if that makes sense? 

I definitely agree with you on the pharmaceutical industry, and I would love to live in a world without the corruption and malpractice that support it, but that world wouldnt be have a structure that requires me to need the medication to function within it in the first place lol (sorry if that is incoherent, Im trying to watch tv and type at the same time lol) 
I definitely recommend reading [this](http://www.abct.org/docs/PastIssue/38n7.pdf) edition of the Behavior Therapist if you havent already, it really opened my eyes to how fucked everything is. "
40," Cheers dude! The stuff about receptors vs actually serotonin makes sense, if I had actually fully read any of the papers I was looking into for this I probably would have realised that before now, but thats ADHD for ya lol "
41," idk why exactly to look out for and its not like im ever going to do caps again since its not worth if lol, but Ive never had a comedown, or any issues with depression, and Ive never taken both in the same day \_()_/ "
42, innuendo studios also has a really great [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJA_jUddXvY7v0VkYRbANnTnzkA_HMFtQ)  ok how right-wingers think 
43," I always get sus when a girl suddenly starts posting a lot of photos of her body, especially in poses that make you look skinnier but not hotter (if that makes sense?) "
44," yeah its wack, no one was sus about my weight until I hit 18.4 and then suddenly everyone was like  "
45," cardio suppresses my appetite like fucking crazy, it doesnt make any sense but Im not complaining lol "
46," I feel like sexual orientation might be a relevant question to ask, I know Id have *very* different answers to the contraceptive questions if I were interested in cis men

edit: also with the pregnancy questions, I feel like they would be very difficult to answer if you physically could not get pregnant... "
47," You might already know but incase you dont, reddit has a save feature (it looks like a bookmark next to the title) that lets you put all the things you want to go back to in one place "
48, cheers! 
49," Im trying to figure out how I feel about authoritarianism, any reading recs? "
50, theres no option to say you dont have a preference towards their age 
51, weight is meaningless if you dont know the persons height 
52," dude, if youre gonna make a shitty joke at least get it right 

theres no such thing as Asperger Spectrum Disorders, aspergers used to be a DSM diagnosis separate from autism, but they were recently combined under *autism spectrum disorder* "
53," I mean theres pansexual, but I feel like a pansexual person would know that bi is most likely close enough for the purposes of the survey "
54," lmao I forgot what this survey was about, and going from thinking about how much I love my mum to being asked about flicking the bean was an experience "
55, cheers! 
56, theres no option for 17 year olds 
57," I have absolutely no insecurities about ageing, Ive always been keen to get greys and leathery skin since theyre traits of the women I admire most, so Ive made a deliberate choice to stay the fuck out of SCA. I know being exposed to a youth-centric (idk what the right term is) standard of beauty would influence my perception of myself and others in a way I would rather just avoid, so Im avoiding it. "
58," it probably will; youve gone extra hard at the gym (water retention) and your eating habbits changed a little (water retention and food weight). But it is not at all reflective of any actual fat gain. I know its so much easier said than done, but please know that the number is bullshit and that maybe you should try and take a break from weigh ins for a little while. Idk all your stats but I would be incredibly surprised if youre not at a sizeable deficit this week, physics means you have to have lost weight, the scale will just make you feel like shit "
59," 1555 isnt over eating, its likely that its below your TDEE, which would be under eating

and in the case that its above or equal to your TDEE, chances are youve been eating much less for an extended period of time, which means that your body still has to recover. One day of eating at maintenance isnt going to cancel out any of the damage done from weeks of restriction

to feel a little better, try getting some electrolytes in you,
basically youre just looking for sodium (salty foods), potassium (fruits), calcium (dairy), magnesium (green veggies, nuts), and phosphorus (white meat, nuts, dairy) "
60, thanks! looks like they only ship to the US though :/ I probably should have mentioned that Im in Australia ahahah 
61, are those socialist tendencies incompatible with marxism? or is it more of like a yes we agree with this general idea but where gonna take it in this direction because thats whats more relevant now sorta thing 
62," sorry if this is a dumb question but Im very sleepy and also not very well-read 

are socialist and marxist (without any prefixes) interchangeable? and if so, wouldnt that also make communist another synonym because socialism is just a step to communism? "
63," That makes it worse imo, either have it set in a universe without systematic racism, or have it set in the real world. Just featuring it as a one off interaction is like saying its not a big deal. "
64," I also agree with the male default thing but Im also a woman and I use man guy dude girl as gender neutral terms, but I can see how that translates really poorly online lol "
65," that is very relatable, sleep good my guy "
66, (thats what internalised homophobia is) 
67, tiktok 
68," Im a lesbian \_()_/

edit: to solve the mystery, Im 53 and I just ask friendly looking Huge Dudes if I can go on their shoulders so I can actually see the stage lol, Im 95lbs so I dont even think half of them notice Im there "
69," yeah Ive just kinda given up

fr though why doesnt that character show up? "
70, what the fuck is wrong with you? 
71, Ive never had a boyfriend and Ive gotten on someones shoulders at every concert/festival Ive ever been to \_()_/ 
72," Sorry I really hope this doesnt come across as creepy but I honestly cant get over how beautiful you are. Your skin, lips, eyes, freckles, like holy shit Ive tried to just scroll past this posts like 3 times now but I cant ahahah

But back to what youre actually here for, hourglass makes *amazing* eyebrow pencils, theyre pricy (50AUD) but Ive tried literally every major pencil money can buy and theyre the only ones I cant break, they also have wayyy more product than similarly sized pencils so it costs less in the long term "
73, CHRIS FLEMING! 
74," Just to add, this information's from the '[Issues](https://berniesanders.com/issues/)'  tab on Bernies' website :) "
75," of course you tell me this *after* I printed and hand wrote my forms ahahaha

definitely saving that for next time "
76," Unfortunately it looks like I wont be able to vote in anything smaller than the federal election, but Ill probably be living in NC in a couple years time so Ill be sure to vote then! :) "
77," Thanks! By the sounds of it, I can register to vote in the general election with the FVAP form, but I cant vote in the primary election. "
78," Ok so I filled out [this form](https://www.fvap.gov/uploads/FVAP/Forms/fpca.pdf) from the FVAP website, and printed out a second one for my mum who wasnt planning on voting because she couldnt be bothered with the hassle

thats +2 for Bernie! "
79," I turn 18 on the 5th of June 2020 and Im trying to register to vote. Im a US citizen, but Ive lived in Australia all my life. The last address my parents held is in North Carolina, and according to [FVAP](https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter/reside) Im eligible to vote absentee, but on [the NCSBE site](https://www.ncsbe.gov/Voters/Registering-to-Vote) it says that you must live in the county of registration and have resided there for at least 30 days prior to the election. I assumed that was just talking about state elections, but [Rock The Vote](https://www.rockthevote.org) has the same information.

So my questions are 
1. Am I eligible to vote?
2. Where can I find the correct forms to fill out?

[EDIT](https://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/d8uoj8/registering_to_vote_as_a_us_citizen_who_has_never/f1cv17d/?utm_source=share utm_medium=ios_app utm_name=iossmf) "

81," you could always apply as a mature aged student when youre 21, you dont need an atar for that

I also feel like TAFE/trades experience could get you into an engineering program earlier if you looked into it "

83," Its never took off where I live so I cant confirm anything, but Ive heard that bumble is more of a WLW app "
84, megan from but im a cheerleader! I found a way to combine my love for tacky costumes (cheerleader) with being gay and good movies 
85, and [heres](https://imgur.com/a/N3FxTkw) what she looks like post-photoshop lol 
86," Oh I totally get what you mean, Ive been filling mine in for years and I still feel so daunted when I have to do someone elses ahaha

Its not so much about creating an ideal shape, but rather enhancing what you already have, as thats what will usually work best with your face.

I use a pencil with a chisel tip and use the flat end to sort of underline my brows, this lets me extend them at the front to bring the start above my tear ducts. It also gives me a defined point to make a tail with at the back. Then I go along that line with little flicks following the direction on my natural hair. Its a little tricky to get the hang of at first ahaha the only tip I really have is to use a light hand "
87," The colour actually matches your complexion and hair beautifully! They would look even better though if you used an eyebrow pencil to define the shape a little more, it would make them look more natural and I think it would contrast really nicely with your soft features "
88, When I worked at a greengrocers my favourite customers were the ones who would either pack their own bags or give very clear and polite instructions on how they wanted theirs packed. People have *very* different expectations and its just nice to have some direction 
89, 99% of the time Im super bubbly and friendly to strangers but sometimes I just get in a mood where I cant be bothered with smiling so Ill pretend to be on my phone when I walk past groups of people \_()_/ 
90," honestly it could be lol

if shes clearly got the girls out and proud (like wearing a very glittery bra and nothing else, say at a music festival) and you said it without any flirty undertones (like with a tone where giving her a high-five wouldnt feel out of place) then it could definitely be appropriate "
91," A good rule of thumb is to only compliment people on something they have control over, otherwise it can come off as awkward and objectifying

Your new hair colour looks great! or I love your outfit! makes them feel good about a choice they made, and they can talk about where they got their inspiration from or something along those lines if they want to keep talking

Your eyes are so beautiful or Youre so pretty they didnt chose their genetics, and theres really nowhere for the conversation to go from there. "
92," Compliments are only weird when they dont give the conversation anywhere to go, and if the persons been told what youre sating a million times before. If youre a guy however (who isnt a supermodel) chances are you dont receive many compliments at all, so if its a passing comment and youre able to direct the conversation in a way where its not awkward, its not weird "
93," I agree, but I feel like generally these sorts of social rules are about interacting with strangers/people youre not very close too, so making the distinction isnt really necessary since youd hope you would be at a point where you can discern the boundaries with someone youre more intimate with "
94, foundation looks super weird on me too! I just wear tinted moisturiser under my cheeks and on my chin to even out the redness 
95, black people can be girls too? 
96," Thats a great idea, cheers dude why didnt I think of that ahaha "
97," I agree, but I also have absolutely no idea how those sorts of movements are are organised "
98," At the very least, by the time the next election rolls around more of the public will be aware of the facts, and more the younger generation will be able to vote. Politicians will realise their positions are reliant on support from these people and will be forced to reform their platforms to cater to them. Mass protests allow people to realise that theyre not alone in being scared about the future, and theyll be more likely to join forces again in labour strikes that can have a more quantifiable impact. They also remind people of the importance of being politically literate, and give platforms to politicians that are invested in meaningful change. Gathering so many likeminded people gives smaller activist groups access to potential members who would have otherwise never heard of their movement. 

Direct action absolutely has its place, but it will only weaken our cause if it is not backed and organised by groups created out of peaceful, appealing movements like these. "
99, the international climate strike 
100," Even if he *did* just show up for the time off, being surrounded by so many passionate individuals would have been an incredibly valuable educational experience for him. He would be listening to speeches on climate change and given resources that could help him actually develop that interest you say you wish he had. 

If he wants to wag school, hes going to wag school. He may as well spend that time developing the values and skills that could make him one of the passionate kids who will one day run this country. "
101, Wollongong climate strike! 
102," this information is from international averages and are in USD, but the trends are still relevant. [source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2019/05/29/renewable-energy-costs-tumble/amp/) 

Hydroelectric power costs $0.05/kWh. Onshore wind, solar photovoltaic, biomass, and geothermal energy cost below $0.10/kWh. However in areas with suitable natural resources (like Australia) onshore wind costs can drop to $0.03-0.04/kWh. Last year alone, the global weighted-average cost of renewable electricity dropped by 14%. Prices for fossil fuels on the other hand, range from $0.05/kWh to $0.15+/kWh, and are only going to rise over time as we deplete out natural resources.

Our dependence on fossil fuels will hurt the Australian economy in the long term. Prices will continue to [rise](https://www.abc.net.au/article/9985300), and this will undeniably hurt low income Australians the most. This can literally be reversed in making the switch to renewables, Australia has the perfect ecosystem to support these systems, implementing them would not only result in lower energy prices, but also in a massive increase in jobs. As technology continues to develop, renewable energy would prove itself as a massively profitable international export, further supporting the economy "
103,  
104, They do teach about climate change in school. Its in the year 9 science curriculum... 
105," How are they with other mental health problems? Would you be able to convince them to let you see a psychologist for something more acceptable like general stress management for school, and then actually just talk to them about your ED

Also, if you live outside of the US, look into your countries mental health services. In australia you get 10 psychologist appointments every year if you have a referral from your GP, its not much but its better than nothing "
106, models have the lankiest limbs 
107, Im a lesbian but this post made me homophobic. 
108," bullying is a really broad term. In my experience at least, its often within friend groups rather than a popular kids pick on the loner situation in movies and stuff, so if youre not in that group, youre not going to notice anything wrong "
109," I set mine as being on my dominant hand but wear it on my non-dominant, not sure how well it works but it definitely clocks less steps "
110," I can see how it could be hurtful to a straight guy, but to say its equally as problematic as it would be with the sexualities reversed is just wrong.

Homophobia is dangerous because of the power imbalance between straight and gay people. Not because its rude. Straight men are not a marginalised group. Talking shit about them does not create attitudes that result in the further subjugation of their group. "
111, Im a lesbian in a friend group of straight/bi guys and our group chat is called women fan club lol 
112," No, when people make the criticism in my previous comment, its aimed at the culture that prioritises his voice over the others in the first place, not the man himself "
113, can you give me an example of this actually happening? 
114, You're a paraplegic who rules over a post apocalyptic wasteland in a monster truck-eske wheelchair? 
115," The other guy deleted his comment while I was typing and I spent way too long trying to articulate my thoughts that Im putting it here lol

While there may be POC and LGBT characters, very few stories focus on the unique experiences people from those backgrounds have. Having a cast that look diverse is important, but it's the bare minimum in representation. Marginalized people experience the world differently from those in the majority, and these perspectives should be represented just as much as any other.  
  
No ones asking for a disabled Tony Hawk game, theyre asking for a Oksana Masters game.  
  
And for what its worth, the *vast* majority all media that does explore these perspective, does so in an incredibly formulaic, cliche, arguably stereotypical way that is clearly designed to appeal to audiences from outside of those communities. "
116," This isnt what mansplaining is, but I think its what theyre referring to;

He's just repeating the exact same ideas non-cishet white guys have been saying this whole time, but hes getting the credit for it because hes a cishet white guy. "
117," The first time I saw lesbians in a movie I bawled my eyes out lol 

It makes me mad knowing that if I had grown up seeing WLW relationships in media, I wouldn't have wasted so much time being confused about my sexuality. "
118," Oh man, you're missing out! He's one of the fab five from the Queer Eye remake :) "
119," Yep, they shame the kids for striking too. The only time they ever seem to give a shit about education is when they can use it as an excuse to silence people "
120," You cant make cigarettes illegal because too many people would resort to crime in order to support their addiction. All measures put in place in the past 40 years have been to prevent people from starting to smoke. E-cigarettes open up nicotine to a new market, so banning them is congruent with the goals of current anti-smoking measures.

EDIT: rip can someone explain why they disagree with me instead of just downvoting? "
121, I was talking more about homophobia 
122," normally when people talk about religious people cherry picking, its about them finding excuses to persecute minorities.

how is that just as bad as being an asshole to individual christians? "
123," just fyi incase you care; transgender is also a noun, transgender*ed* is grammatically a little wack and also seen as somewhat insensitive by some trans people since its traditionally been used with negative connotations "
124, my dads 50 and feels accomplished if he manages to make it to 9:30 lol he wakes up at like 5 though 
125," a lot of people identify as non-binary but are only out to close friends who understand gender from their perspective, theres also no way to tell if someones nom-binary just from looking at them, so your perception of the amount of enbys out there isnt going to be very accurate "
126," and I would also be totally cool with someone downloading my car because all they did was make a copy, *I still get to keep my car* "
127, Internalised misogyny is still misogyny 
128," thats how little they care, they never even bothered to learn her gender "
129," lmao I was actually trying the video so I could link it, but all that came up were complications rip "
130, I appreciate your sacrifice 
131, we just need to find one more and weve got a gang 
132," I remember when I crossed my legs a little too hard for the first time lmao

like, wow, didnt know it did that "
133, ok i hope this doesnt sound creepy but i saw ur recent post on edanon and it was # relatablecontent then i saw that were the same stats and age so i was like omg is this me? and stalked ur post history a little and *we have the same fucking birthday* and this is wack 
134, fuck dude even just people at the beach lmao 
135," it might not be food weight, but its literally physically impossible for it to be fat weight.

there as so many factors that contribute to the scale going up its not even funny. especially since you ate differently than you normally would last week, your bodys just adjusting. you might have wooshed after the increase in calories, and now youre just fluctuating upwards because of sodium, carbs, bowel movements, exercise, hormones, water, whatever "
136, follow up question then; how do i give myself  chronic tonsillitis? 
137," someone already comment this but like, I can not stress this enough; please be there for your sister "
138," Oh! You do? Thank heavens! Now that I know Im fuckable to you, I can finally drop this *silly* habit of mine! What on earth was I thinking? Going around with a mental illness like that when theres plenty of wonderful men like you out there to determine my worth  "
139," I have the narrowest hips on the face of the earth, but I still get a thigh gap at a relatively high weight !full gap at bmi 18.6, small gap until 19.8ish!  (compared to what Ive heard other girls talk about !like sub bmi 17!)

I guess my body just doesnt feel like storing much fat there, which is fucking rude because Id rather have thicc thighs than a muffin top and double chin, but thats what I get when I go over !bmi 19! \_()_/ "
140, thats probably because youre not a lesbian lol 
141, yes! but mainly because my right side is my good side so I need to sit in the drivers seat lol 
142, (reddit goofed and posted twice btw) 
143," Idk, I get what you mean but its pretty easy to bring that sort of thing up in a not-creepy way. Especially if they didnt meet through a dating app

Hey Im really excited for dinner tonight! Just first thought, I know a few of my friends check in with their friends when theyre on dates, do you want my number plate or something? "
144," MOC are such a minority in my area, theyre probably at a similar risk of harassment. I always just assume they feel the same way I do when I see them walking alone at night, and I never feel the unsafe or like I need to cross the street.

I also have a few non-white guy friends, and they all have changed their behaviour in some sort of way to distance themselves from stereotypes, Ive done the same thing as a lesbian. Its sad, but it means theyre more likely to be aware of how their actions look to someone else (ie; speeding up if theyre walking behind me), which also makes the situation less uncomfortable than if it were a white dude

EDIT: sorry for going of on a tangent lol, I dont want to sound like Im invalidating your experiences, people are fucking racist and MOC are undoubtedly vilified, Im wouldnt be at all surprised to see that women feel more unsafe around MOC than white men. "
145," in australia, the restrictions for people who have lived in the UK only apply if it was over 6 months and between 1980 and 1996 "
146," and like, its not even a little bit clever? the only level it makes sense on is that noodles are in some Asian food, like thats all you could think of? "
147," but heres the thing

Im a fucking pussy, thatll hurt my lil nostrils "
148, my dad said this to me when I came out lol 
149, thanks for the tips :) its not my first rodeo I just am stuck in my capsule ways ahaha 
150," Im 53 and 103lbs, a couple months ago I took 400mg with a 200mg redose. I didnt have a come down (I never have) and I didnt have any noticeable health issues, but my roll was just super speedy and there was basically none of the fun lovey-doveyness that I love about MDMA. I should have taken less for no other reason than it would have been more fun "
151," see this is why the peer review process is so important

i think ill just stick to eating them "
152," wait i think youve just given me an idea:

wrap the crystals in listerine breath strips, that way itll they dissolve better than TP *and* you get minty fresh breath "
153," I saw that your from the gong in another one of your posts, Billabong and Surf Dive n Ski in town both sell hydroflasks now :) "
154," I dmed every single 18/19 year old white girl I had a mutual friend with on instagram asking if I could buy an old license of theirs (here you get a new one at 16, 17, and 18) and it worked pretty well "
155," yeah, you got some silverware, but really are you eating though? are you eating though?


u got me donald, i am not eating "
156," boosting, its where you shoplift popular products (usually electronics, cosmetics, or designer fashion) and sell them at a 30%-60% discount online "
157," My friend has a 12 year and an 8 year gap with her siblings, and Im honestly so jealous of the relationship she has with they. Its such a good support network, theyre old enough to call you out on dumb shit, and young enough for you to actually listen to them. "
158," I get how this would be great for most kids, but as someone with ADHD all I can think of is how much of a nightmare that sort of approach to learning would have been for me in primary school lol "
159," My math teacher makes juniors (years 7-10) stay back for half of lunch (so for 20 minutes) to write lines if theyre being shitty, its usually for disrupting others, skipping class, or not handing in assignments (they get about 8 per year)

PE teachers will also make you do it if you forget your uniform, but other that thats it. "
160," I know my mums apple ID info, so if I log into find my iphone, I can see exactly where she is. Its great but Im always terrified Ill accidentally hit the alarm button one day lol "
161, r/eyehurtingflags FIFY 
162," that leaves out trans women tho,

how about, ATTTF attracted to those tiddies, fam "
163," Im a lesbian and Im the only girl in my friend group, there *are* a lot of shitty men out there, but the good ones are amazing, and I can honestly say they are all beautiful in their own way despite not being conventionally attractive. 

Also, and this may be the gay coming in here, all of my female friends boyfriends are *gross as hell* and they all think theyre stunning. so if instagram model sophie can think this rat from flushed away lookin ass dude is hot, someone will find you hot. "
164, tfw u forget that lesbians 
165," gynophile sounds like a word for people attracted to gynaecologists, since the prefix gyno isnt really used anywhere else lol

I *love* the world sapphic, but thats just for women who are attracted to women, men not included

the hunt continues "
166," Oh yeah its definitely a thing, its called heteronormativity. Im a lesbian and whenever I talk about partners Ive been with people assume I misspoke/made a typo when I use female pronouns, or just get confused lol "
167," tbf I cant guess mens weight, youre all just so... dense

my best friend is my exact same height (54) and looks about as thin as I am (Im 47kg), but hes 15kg heavier? wack "
168," itd be a lot easier if everyone else could come to that conclusion too, im either a 4 or 9 depending on who you ask

so like maybe i dont have body dysmorphia and my face really is constantly changing "
169," wait, you can stop having body dysmorphia? please share ur secrets im fucking dying here "
170," I get what youre saying, but it they be better than yeeting in the meantime before youre ready to develop better coping mechanisms? "
171, I actually did it last year! It probably helps that I go to a selective school in a very left wing area (like half my teachers are marxists) but for the most part the units on political issues Ive done since year 7 havent been too bad 
172," Im full sending this to my old english teacher, his year 10s should probably be up to frontline by now "
173, That was a fun unit lol 
174," total daily energy expenditure, basically how many calories (energy) you expend (burn) in a day.

so this number includes your BMR (base metabolic rate), which is how many calories you burn just by being alive (like if you were in a coma) along with all the extra calories you burn from not being in a coma, so exercise but also just general movement/functioning 

Say your BMR is 1300, that means that no matter how little you move in a day, you will burn that many calories. Your TDEE will include an additional 50-80% depending on how active you are, putting your TDEE somewhere between 1560-1959

To find their TDEE, a lot of people will calculate it as if they were sedentary (so BMR + 50%), and then manually add on calories burned through exercise. 

TDEE/BMR are just guidelines though, its really hard to get actuate numbers for these things through averages and online calculators as there are a *lot* of factors at play that just cant be adequately accounted for "
175," so it was developed in 2013 by mathematicians (not doctors) to replace the current scale, which supposedly gives short people a lower score and tall people too high a score. 

current formula: BMI = weight(kg)/height(m)^2

new formula: BMI = 1.3*weight(kg)/height(m)^2.5 

however *no* professionals use the new scale in assessing patients body composition, so I choose to ignore it, but Im sure if I were taller Id have a different opinion ahaha "
176," just a heads up though to anyone reding this, especially short people, the site shows your bmi *and* your new bmi (which is not recognised by the vast majority of clinicians) which i could see as being super triggering to people who get really caught up in numbers, and theres no way to turn it off "
177," I hope this isnt considered a tip because knowing the calorie math stops me from extreme restricting and comforts me after a binge:

theres 7700 calories is a kilo of fat, but in order to gain that (real, not food/water) weight you have to eat that *on top of* your TDEE (usually 1500-2000) so say you have a 3000 calorie binge, and your TDEE is 1700, only 1300 of those calories counts, and youd gain 1300/7700 = 0.16 kilos (160 grams) 

so if youre trying to figure long itd take you to lose a kilo eating x amount of calories per day, you need to figure out how much your burning per day

if youre TDEE is 1700, and you eat 1200, that puts you at -500 calories per day, 7700/500 = 15.4, so itd take you ~16 days to lose a kilo of actual fat. If you want to lose more than a kilo, just times 7700 by how many you want to lose.

You could also do this is lbs (3500 calories per lb) but the math gets weird with the imperial system and the lb/oz conversion isnt as clean as kg/g. Also, I like working in kilos better because with lbs, small changes are super noticeable "
178, justcico.com (made by a proed user!) is also really useful 
179, me too! ganggang 
180," my feminist stance on the issue is that it just shouldnt be a big deal, I like the look and feel of shaved armpits both on myself and others much more than hairy ones, but I just cant be fucked to shave sometimes and no one should expect me to be shaving in the first place. Its like getting annoyed at people for not having abs, like sure its attractive, and indicates that you take pride in your appearance, and having a strong core is practical, but it doesnt mean you should expect people to have a toned stomach, or be disgusted by those who dont. "
181," thats so strange, my schools on a ~200x200m block in the middle of town and theres 5 ~40x15m blocks scattered around the campus, you have to walk about 50m outdoors to get from  class to class. Theres wide open gates on each side of the school, and up until about 10 years ago there just straight up wasnt any fences, people would cut through the school to walk to work faster "
182," I think they fill the same purpose as the iPod touch did from like 2009-2013, theyre for kids that are too young for an actual phone, but old enough to know what the internet is. If youre not around 9-13 year olds itd seem like no one was using them. "
183," I do that too! lol Ill literally yeet my phone across the room after I send a risky text

and seriously thank you for the advice, Im going to message him now and go to bed before I have time to change my mind ahahah "
184," Thanks for replying :)

I think a big part of it is that I dont want to be like your friend, I talk about myself a lot in normal conversations but its normally just because I remembered a funny story or Im being self-deprecating. So I dont want to come off as self centred, and I think if I just vent at my friends Itll feel like Im using them. So like the logical solution would be to get them to open up to me first, but I dont like asking other people about themselves, because I feel like if they wanted to tell me something, they would have already, and by asking Im overstepping/being annoying. I know thats not the case though now and I should just ask them, but I dont know how to start those conversations "
185," The number of strip searches have increased 20-fold in NSW, Australia over the past 12 years. From 277 times in 2006, to 5483 in 2018. 

Nothing is found 65% of the time, and of that, only 20% of cases ever result in criminal charges.   
Further, of the 91% of searches are conducted to find prohibited drugs, only 30% have resulted in charges.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders account for 10% of recorded strip searches, despite only making up 3.3% of the population.

[Another source](https://www.news.com.au/national/nsw-act/news/nsw-police-officers-are-increasingly-conducting-unlawful-strip-searches-experts-find/news-story/2ef73aff0a1f6d01f4aa7a7b1bb07b6e) 

Facebook page [Sniff Off](https://www.facebook.com/sniffoff/) documents hundreds of strip search operations across the state, many of which are during peak commuter hours at Sydney train stations.

These searches are also illegal. NSW law only allows for strip searches to be conducted  ""in serious and urgent circumstances that make it necessary"".  82% of all charges laid are for possession of a prohibited drug not indented for supply. Carrying drugs for ones own personal use is neither serious nor urgent.

186,  
187," dude, shes 16 "
188," I feel like Ross is too warm and friendly, and Paul gives of Craig vibes and Craig is probably more of a pushover office drone type "
189," I got my drugs tested at a music festival earlier this year and me and my friend who I always feel fat next to went in together and had a chat with the doctor there, at one point he was like you two cant be more that 45 kilos a piece, definitely dont take more than 100mg (i took 600mg lmao) and like sure hes a dude and super old and pretty overweight (meaning probably not the best weight estimator, nothing against fat old dudes, yall do you) but HE THOUGHT WE WERE THE SAME SIZE and HE THOUGHT I WAS MY GW and also HE SAID MY CAPS WERE REALLY GOOD honestly hes my favourite person on this earth, I love him

that probably wasnt coherent I am very tired but that is my contribution to this post, thank you and good night. "
190, David? Steven? Daren? 
191," he specialises in ADHD, ADS, and tourettes, (I have ADHD) and Im like 99% certain he has absolutely no clue about eating disorders, or fuck even just teenage girls

I weighed in last month after a fucking monstrous feed and when he looked at the scale and saw it was up 4kg from last time (100% water+food weight, the day before I hit a LW by 0.1g lmao) and he was visibly shook and started talking about the implications of being on the upper end of BMI scale (keep in mind this weight put me at like 20) and binge eating, and like, what? who says that? *that is now how you handle this situation dude*

I didnt care but all I could think about was what if I werent me? From the posts here I know for a fact that that would have *fucked up* a lot of people with eating disorders, and Im just lucky that mine manifests the way it does. 

If I did need treatment for my ED, I could probably figure out a way to see a psychologist without letting my current doctors know that Im seeing them about ED stuff, its just frustrating that I have to go through the back door you know? Im actually trying to see one now anyway since Ive realised that psychiatry is basically pseudoscience and the only thing its good for its drugs, but idk how long Ill have to wait since theres hardly any that 1. know what ADHD is (?) and 2. know its not just a disorder for shitty 7 year old boys. "
192," Im on meds that suppress appetite as a side effect, and since going on them I dropped a fuck load of weight, and my psychiatrist and GP are suspicious that I might have an eating disorder. Youd think that in identifying that a patient is at a high risk of developing a serious mental illness, that you would refer them to see a specialist to work through any potential issues before they arise, but fuckin NOPE all I get is a warning that if I drop below *x* weight, Im off my meds. Thats it. No help. Just an ultimatum. Im too afraid to ask for a referral myself, because I feel like theyll take me off my meds. The likelihood of me deciding to recover has absolutely fucking plummeted now that it comes with going off my meds. Its fucking ridiculous, I *know* I could work through this shit with an actual professional, but I have to choose between treating one mental illness or the other. This literally means I wont get help until Im *fucking dying* and I know I cant be the only one in this situation. The entire system is backwards.

*EDIT*: wow that got unrelated fast, sorry for the rant ahahaha "
193," yes! like, i get it if the patients literally going to die if they dont gain weight in a couple weeks, but thats a very small minority of people suffering with eating disorders, and the main reason people get *that* sick is because they werent treated meaningfully when theyre symptoms stated. You dont just wake up one morning with a BMI of 15 "
194," if you want to learn more, you should definitely check out [this](https://youtu.be/c2PAajlHbnU) video "
195," more like gayDHD 

heyooooo "
196," dude... are we the same person? I thought I was the only lesbian with vaginismus and no period, weve gotta find one more and start a gang "
197," I always mix vodka with diet soda (orange soda is the best, it masks it so well) and if someone asks I say that its because the fake sugar flavour overpowers the alcohol, and that the fake sugar tricks your stomach into digesting it faster

its all bullshit, but people accept that you could believe that

vodka is 72cals per standard drink, and according to my spreadsheet (god im so fucking lame) is also the cheapest per standard drink "
198," oh yeah I totally get not wanting to be super open on social media, but like, you can be private without building a narrative around your ~recovery journey~

and like adhd mood, ive written like 5 paragraphs responding to you and deleted them bc theyve got absolutely nothing to do with anything you said, i love it when my meds kick in lmao "
199," I totally agree, and thats why I added the part about them claiming its based on societal standards, maybe its just me but all the posts I see are about how they wanted to have the ideal body or look like someone else. My ED started because of my ADHD, and I feel like half the people on this sub alone developed theirs from other metal illnesses or trauma, and the for the other half who have theirs out of body image issues, its much more nuanced and complex than simply wanting to look better, but these posts dont go into that, they talk about the media and diet culture and leave it at that. "
200," Recovery posts on instagram that are just before and after shots of the posters body piss me off.

Youd think that in overcoming their eating disorder -so well in fact that they feel they need to use it to inspire others- that they would have learned that their worth is not determined by the extent to which they conform to conventional standards of beauty. That their worth can not be determined by the shape of their body. But youd be wrong.

So, to the girls on my feed;

If you really want to help others like you say you so desperately do, dont talk about how you got to the before photo by running *exactly this far* and eating *exactly this much* or how you got to the more socially acceptable, gymshark sponsorship worth body by just *intuitive eating* and only *lifting*. Talk about how your ed slowly isolated you from all the people and things you loved. Talk about how hard it was to finally reach out and get help. Talk about how now youre learning to view yourself as more than just a body. Talk about how you love making others laugh, you love learning, you love meeting new people, you love just existing in nature and being aware of the world around you, whatever the fuck it is- and talk about how because of your ED, which as you say yourself, started because you cared so fucking much about how you looked, you spent *years* you could have been doing what you love, thinking about numbers, and making your mum cry.

You wont though. You dont want to. You just want to talk about how great you look now, and *exactly how thin* you were before. "
201, should be yourself* in the title rip 
202," like???? i do???? that is a photo of me??? from 20 seconds ago???? my face has not changed????? thats not how faces work???? 

but apparently i cant get that through to my brain "
203," Ive got moles all over my stomach and I really love them, but at my last skin check my dermatologist said that theyll probably start to raise into bumps soon, because thats just what they do I guess, and it really bums me out that theyre changing :( "
204," A study conducted at Harvard Medical School, in 2007, found that girls with ADHD were almost four times more likely to have an eating disorder than those without ADHD. Another empirical study found that 11 percent of women with ADHD, compared to 1 percent of women without, reported a history of bulimia nervosa. [link](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-linked-to-eating-disorders/) 

i also found it weirdly interesting/comforting to search eating disorder on the adhd subreddit, theres a lot of us over there "
205, I like it \\_()_/ 
206," fuck you, I got mine "
207," that makes a lot of sense, i think stuff like that just works for me because i have an *insanely* active inner voice and telling it to shut up and fuck off is the only way i can it shut down, like in proving it wrong about the instant obesity thing, ive proven that i cant trust it "
208," if you can, you have hypothyroidism, and you need to go to the hospital.

youd also have a plethora of other symptoms, so its unlikely. 

youre almost definitely just holding onto water/food weight. it can take weeks to woosh. it happens if youve had a lot of sodium, not drunk enough water, not eaten enough fibre, if youve started working out more, or stopped working out as much, or changed your workouts, if its near or during your period, and a million other reasons im not even going to pretend to understand

its hard but try to stay away from the scale for a little while, its an incredibly unreliable way to track body composition "
209," this might not be a good idea, but if this happened to me, I would try to get myself into the best headspace possible, put on an item of clothing that is tight/not stretchy, take it off, make myself eat a small portion of the fear food, and then put the item of clothing back on. Just to prove to myself that the dream isnt possible. The laws of physics are in control, not my intrusive thoughts. "
210, I started vyvanse in march. I went from 53kg to 47 in 6 weeks and managed to maintain it. Its insane lmao 
211," yeah theres a girl at my highschool thats been tumblr bonespo skinny since I met her (year 7, were in year 11 now) and were not *that* close but she doesnt show any signs whatsoever of having an eating disorder "
212," if natural means unintentionally, people on ADHD meds who dont abuse them to lose weight (cant relate lmao) would be naturally skinny, and theres enough people on them that I think its a worthwhile mention, but the crossover between EDs and ADHD is actually insane so maybe not

theres also heaps of super thin teenage/20-something guys who claim its natural and they want to gain weight, but idk how true that is for many of them. I have a lot of friends that fit this description and almost all of them are super fat-phobic, idk if its a coping mechanism, or just internalised standards, but its a weird correlation "
213," these are the criteria I evaluated myself against when I was coming to terms with my disordered eating

1. is my relationship with food normal? like would a typical healthy person find them odd

2. will my body be harmed if my eating habits dont change?

3. even if I dont feel like it does right now, does my relationship with food have the potential to effect aspects of my life outside of eating (like determining my self worth, and making me isolate myself from people, interests, and activities) "
214," yesterday i was absolutely fucked, like i couldnt stop shaking, my heart beat was 180 sitting down, my face was sweaty, and i straight up couldnt have a coherent conversation

i went home from school early and had 2 bananas, 125g of blueberries, 2 mandarins, 14 almonds, and a cup of black tea with milk sugar, and idk what did what but i felt human after that, and it was ~400 calories "
215," check the labels, diet sport drinks usually only have one of the 4+ electrolytes full calorie drinks have, so its really not giving you any benefits. check to see if your local chemist has any electrolyte products, theyll be more likely to be low in sugar and high in what you actually need "
216," I hope this doesnt sound creepy lol but i kinda stalked your profile and we have a super similar face shape. If youre self conscious about your forehead, you should try bangs, like its actually insane how much more balanced they make my face look. "
217," Im thinking like buccal fat removal or kybella, but from what Ive seen they dont really do much "
218, https://imgur.com/a/Hc0WDuz 
219," It sounds like youre uncomfortable with your eating behaviours and that you dont feel like youre fully in control of them. Thats not healthy or normal, so youre eating is disordered.

I personally believe that *specific* eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia, orthorexia, and EDNOS are purely medical tools to describe how someones disordered eating is manifesting at one point in time, and so theyre not useful or relevant outside of a clinical context, as disordered eating behaviours and attitudes are dynamic and highly individual.


All that matters is that youre struggling and you deserve and need support. "
220," oooo wheres you get the dress from? Im an au4 (side note: its a us00) and i swear no stores stock it, and if they do, its just a vanity sized 6 or an 8 (looking at you supr) "
221," Ive bounced between !18-18.5! for about 6 months now and havent had any issues so far, but I was coming from !20.4-20.8! so it wasnt a *huge* change for my body

and Im also on stimulant medication so like, if I did have issues with fatigue, I wouldnt know 

and Im also not a doctor, my GP and my psychiatrist have both said that under no circumstances should I go below !18.9! or theyll take me off my meds, but they havent really explained why "
222," ahhh wait fuck dude I just read your full post, EDs arent something you want, theyre not a healthy coping mechanism, any of the positives people get from them can either be gotten at a much lower price elsewhere, or arent worth the pain. "
223," not self discipline, but just self assuredness. If I dont want to do something Im not going to do it, but Im not not going to do something because I dont think I can


i dont think that sentence was coherent lol but hopefully you get the idea "
224," if this is a legit question, most phones have accessibility features like VoiceOver for blind/vision impaired people, that describe everything on your screen, it also has more advanced dictation features for typing "
225," both of the casual jobs ive had in australia have had paid breaks, my old one was 15 minutes after 5 hours, and now i get 20 minutes after 5 hours

229, I know right! My life goal is to be even half as prepared as my nana lol I have no idea what sort of mary poppins sorcery is going on in her handbag 
230," I got gifted hot hands at work too! I work at a laser tag place where Ill be in charge of kids birthday parties, a couple weeks ago I introduced myself to a kids grandmother and when I shook her hand she audibly gasped and got some hot hands out of her purse and put them in the pocket of my jacket. She also cut my coworkers and I a slice of the cake she made. Im very jealous of her grandkids ahahaha "
231, and ABBA means youre gonna have one hell of a boggie 
232," Just for the winners though, not the finalists, otherwise the most popular kids from the largest school would get in just on sheer numbers "
233," absolutely, if youre really worried you can just add 10% since in my experience, thats the absolutely (rare) maximum amount foods will be over weight, but I wouldnt be too concerned "
234,  
235," Youre not being unfair at all, it would feel really invalidating and lonely to deal with that response all the time

I dont know your history, like what hes tried to do in the past, but I can see wheres he might be coming from. He probably just seriously doesnt know what to say, especially since its *really* easy to say the wrong thing when it comes to EDs. If I were you Id tell him how you feel, and then give him specific things he can do next time, like just give you a hug, or make you a cup of tea. He probably just needs some direction. "
236, ha. 
237," If you dont mind me asking, what university was that at? Thats absolutely disgusting. "
238," Do you know who [Kali Uchis](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bn7WBQhB2AF/?igshid=rbniyxi1p163) is? She is definitely one of Maddys style icons, especially with her prom dress and the two piece at the carnival. Shes also on the middle to higher end of the BMI range, and shes just as (if not more so, because shes the OG lol) sexy, powerful, and captivating as Maddy. I saw her live at the start of this year and it probably saved me from falling too deep into my ED. This is definitely way to long of a response to your lighthearted comment lol but hey maybe this is useful, also Kali has amazing music anyway so if not anything else this is a rec for her lol "
239," Ok so I sent it and said 

Im not using this as an excuse. I just want you to understand that Im not doing this on purpose, and I have actually been trying really hard to get better at remembering things. I know that it must be frustrating for you and I know that Im painful. But I need you to understand that I am not malicious or lazy. It feels like you and dad both think I am and that really hurts. I have been trying really hard and Im sorry for being rude, but Im just constantly frustrated. 

Reading it back now, its not the best, but whatever I can talk about it with her later. 

I know Ive said this a lot but seriously, thank you for understanding, and for the resources, and for just being here right now. I really appreciate it.

The way you explain emotions really makes sense to me, and understanding and controlling them is a lot less frustrating when I think about it like that. "
240, Omg I love Euphoria! I was seriously triggered by how thin Jules is lmao 
241," Ive never had a fibre one bar, but Im guessing its at least a little similar to bread, consistency wise? like spongy?

because if it is, I know that breads weight changes heaps depending on humidity and altitude and stuff like that, so the weight on the package is probably the most reliable number you have

fr go weight a slice of bread right now, its wack "
242," it doesnt sound crazy at all! Ill definitely check those resources out, thank you for the recommendations :) Ive always thought the idea of lucid dreaming was really cool, but I had no idea it could be used for purposes greater than omg im flying, thats dope ahaha "
243," My mum just came into my room a sat down on my bed to show me some meme or something (which is frustrating because I feel like shes just pretending nothing happend and invalidating my feelings, but I know she means well, shes just trying to cheer me up) and the conversation moved back into what we were fighting about and then she said that if I really felt bad about losing things I would have dealt with them, **which I have**, and I just absolutely lost my shit, Ive never been that angry before in my life. I just told her to get out and I just dont know how I feel. I should feel bad for not being able to control my emotions. I should feel bad for speaking to my mum like that. But I dont. And that makes me feel... uncomfortable

I cant decide if sending this message is a good idea or not:

I *really* dont want her to think Im using my ADHD as an excuse, but I also really dont want her to think Im intentionally not doing things.

Im sorry for emotionally vomiting all over you, please dont feel like you have to answer this, but thank you for just reading it "
244," Thank you so much, youre really kind and your words mean a lot to me. 

Ive always been pretty close off towards mindfulness stuff since my high school really pushes it, but hearing what youve done to make it work for you (rather than just following a blanket program for 800 teenagers lol) would be really interesting and helpful :) and Im actually in Australia myself so were on the same timezone! "
245, I just realised that the fact that whenever I get super angry or sad I think damn I really just wanna fuckin throw up right now (not in a getting rid of calories way) is probably definitely an insight into something lmao but I do not have the energy to deal with it 
246," like for real though its insane 

I went to america for 3 weeks, and the entire trip was a non-stop culinary experience (read: binge) with absolutely no exercise or purging. I mentally prepared myself to have gained at least 4kg, but I got on the scale (after a full day on eating and fully dressed mind you) and was only 2kg heavier than when I left

I seriously believe that all those TDEE calculators massively underestimate how many calories an average teenage girl burns, because theres *no way* mines the 1500 I estimated, it just looked that way when I was weighing myself religiously because of fluctuations "
247," it sucks right now but its worth it

if it makes you feel any better, every time i weighed myself in recovery (it was very short lived lmao but the point still stands) I was shocked by how little I had gained, when you take out the variables that impact day to day fluctuations, gaining real weight actually takes a pretty long time. Im sure you dont weigh nearly as much as you feel like you do "
248," people will only know what they are if theyre already suspicious, and educated about EDs, so that basically leaves only other people with EDs and doctors

if anyone asks you can just say you get really dry hands, or that youve started boxing classes

but also, apparently sunscreen is really good at healing them, so you could try that? sorry that youre in this situation, i hope youre able to figure something out  "
249," I know it hard, but not weighing yourself, and being kinder to your recovering body is worth it. Its easy to change your mind on the spot at the doctors and decide to look, so what I always do is chug heaps of water, put on heavy clothes, and get out of the house before I can have any other thoughts. That way the number is unreliable if you do decide to look. "
250, anarchism is leftist tho... 
251, i have dyslexia now 
252, and AFAB means assigned female at birth 
253," I swear like half the kids at my school are on it at any given time, everyone has super clear skin and super chapped lips "
254," when its bad, its *really* bad, but when its good, its just kinda shitty

like, it makes your skin really dry so you get super dehydrated easily and have to use a fuckload of moisturiser and lipbalm, you also cant get waxed or your skin will fall off "
255, Shortbread is a disgrace to cookies. 
256," oh absolutely, Im honestly really surprised that its prescribed so often, and also that it is literally 2019 and we dont have a reliable treatment for something as (seemingly, idk Im not a dermatologist) simplistic as pimples lmao "
257," shit dude thats actually really interesting. Ive never heard that criticism of her before, but now that I think back on her videos I can see what you mean. I probably have some ideas about trans people that are based off of her alone, and I should start listening to more trans perspectives. "
258," sure, but if your the person getting shot at, are you really going to trust them to unload the gun? "
259," guys who lie about putting it on, and guys who poke holes in them "
260," its also either have good skin or have a child

the two main medical options to treat acne for women are birth control and acutance. birth control is, well, birth control, and acutance will fuck up your baby so bad it would be inhumane to let it develop "
261," ahaha nah, thanks for the information but I was more just trying to make a comparison "
262," like, the tieing of them lol "
263," it depends, some come off like shirts/sports bras, some have a clip at the back like a regular bra, and some have both for some stupid reason

and yeah a little, but idk how ties work so it goes both ways ahahah "
264," this post isnt shitting on people who dont drink or party, its shitting on people who think theyre superior to other people because they dont drink or party "
265," I go to a selective high school, and like half the people here are like this

save me "
266," its given as the lowest you should go if youre trying to lose weight as a short, sedentary, adult woman

the rationale is that you dont have enough room to eat enough food to meet your nutritional needs with any less than 1200, without medical supervision "
267, yep! ive got like 3 of those lol 
268," you sound like youd like the content on r/breadtube 

Contrapoints makes really high quality youtubevideos that go super into social issues, she would be a great introduction into the leftist perspective. Philosophy tube also has similar content.

If you like more comedy/pop culture oriented stuff, HBomberguy, Jack Saint, and Big Joel are also great "
269," [this is one ](https://images.app.goo.gl/GppmAJp6JoiAUqUS8) its on the line between bra and top, and people wear them as either. Its usually bra shaped but super pretty and without underwire or hard cups. "
270," it seems like with every generation, women are losing their fucks earlier and earlier

Im 17 and almost out of all of mine, its fantastic "
271," 400-600 would mean having a TDEE from 2000-3000, its more likely that people reading this have a TDEE from 1500-2500, so 300-500 calories is probably more accurate "
272," can yall please just convert to the metric system already, this hurt to read "
273," https://www.ikea.com/ms/en_US/IKEA_Food/IKEA_Nutrition_Spreadsheet_January_2018_consumer.pdf

i havent read this yet so idk if it has the salmon, but this is from jan 2018 in the US, ill look for something more recent "
274, iLL bRiNg ThE cORsEtS 
275,"  implying liberals are radical left

lmao what "
276," sure, but I doubt the 16 year old with 215 followers dancing in her basement is that committed "
277," [friendship ended with instagram girls. now tiktok girls is my best friend ](https://www.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpics.me.me%2Fthumb_friendship-ended-with-modasir-alman-is-best-friend-three-years-35901420.png imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fme.me%2Ft%2Ffriendship-ended-with tbnid=lzesCsERp4hcpM vet=1 docid=njxKHsZM1ZPG_M w=200 h=152 hl=en-au source=sh%2Fx%2Fim) 

you cant facetune videos, the future is now old man "
278," I used to when my ED was really bad, but now I just add 15 cals to everything "
279," I legitimately have no idea what my body looks like, but its never really bothered me, Ive never really hated my body, just how I feel in it. Being *x*kg and starving is nicer than being *x*-5kg and full. If it were just my body, I wouldnt have an eating disorder. My perception of my face is entirely dependent on how much Im eating, and its a really fucking big deal. "
280," I always just say I have disordered eating, and if my doctor decides to put a label on it at different stages thats up to her and just her business. For me at least. I dont really see the value getting caught up in the diagnostic criteria of each specific disorder, especially with the dynamic nature of my own (which sounds similar to yours, almost like, scarily ahaha we have the exact same stats and history minus me being a year older).

But it sounds those labels are important to you though, and Im not trying to invalidate that at all. Disorders, especially those developed in formative years, are naturally going to a part of peoples identity, and if finding the right terms makes it easier for you, you do you, but I just thought Id offer an second perspective :) "
281," i cook full meals just to make evidence that i ate lol

i just chuck it in a container and give it to people at school "
282, I hit 53 at 12 and just stopped forever lol 
283, im pretty sure i dont actually have a hole 
284, this is super late but I always thought vyvanse was just for binge eating disorder but my doctor told me the other day that its also used to stop binge/restrict cycles and that kinda blew my mind ahaha 
285, Yeah I drink 4L a day now and Im still dehydrated sometimes lol 
286, like going over one of those rainbow speed boosts in mario kart 
287, pads/liners are also great for dealing with fresh nipple piercings! 
288," god Im so jealous 

#vaginismusganggang "
289, and the other one is close enough to the bi flag! 
290, all of my barbies were lesbians lol 
291," Or stricter driving laws. Over here, if you are caught so much as touching your phone outside of a cradle while the car is on, even if stopped, you lose 3 to 5 demerit points and a $250 - $577 fine (170 - 391USD), depending on the state. And in NSW theyre rolling out cameras that can detect if people are in their phones. While Ive only been driving for a couple months (Im 17) I live in a pretty metro area, and I have never seen a person use their phone while the car is moving (some use it in traffic or at lights though) so it must be working at least a little bit

Also, with drink driving, in NSW if youre caught with a BAC over 0.05, you now lose your license on the spot "
292," Im Australian but I was visiting family in the states last month and I still can not get over how fucking insane the drivers there are. I saw a man scrolling on his phone *while merging onto the freeway* and when I pointed it out to my friend who was driving, he didnt even react! it was normal! what the fuck! and then later my cousin was giving us a tour of DC in his car, and he spent half the time sending emails! when I told him to stop typing or pull over he looked at me like I was a fucking narc or something. "
293, only if bojack gets his shit genuinely sorted first 
294," but like, safe drugs

if anything bad happened to her id cry "
295, because i am gay and i am starved for characters to live vicariously through? 
296, blatant homophobia smh 
297," oh it definitely is, but thats kinda the point

no one would expect you to cover russell signs with a bandage, theyd assume it was from an injury, so you wont have to worry about people being suspicious 

it super extra, but if youre really stressed about people finding out, it would work "
298," honestly, if you genuinely are eating that little and not losing weight at all, you should see a doctor, thats not normal "
299," aye! i gained 4.4 in one week 

ganggang "
300," no one will notice, but i would be anxious too. could you bandage your whole hand up and just tell people you dropped something on it if they ask? "
301," theres definitely more cis lesbians than there are trans characters, but to say *theres a lot* of them is just incorrect, lesbian representation is really lacking "
302, oh my god yes I was so fucking jealous of Andy the whole time WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DONT WANT TO KEEP LIVING A GLAMOURS LIFE WITH THIS BEAUTIFUL TERRIFYING WOMAN 
303," sorry to keep replying but one thing that got me to get my sleep schedule on track was having to wake up early for work, getting a jobs probably a but drastic but if you start making plans with her early in the morning (going out for breakfast, or for a walk or bike ride together, or maybe the gym) shell learn pretty quickly that staying up that late just isnt sustainable "
304," Im 17 but when I was 12ish I would sometimes sneak my ipod at night, then one day my parents noticed and started taking it away at 9pm, from then I was even more determined to get it back and I would sneak it on nights I normally wouldnt have, just to spite them. It was super petty but thats how 12 year olds are. I wish parents had instead tried to cooperate with me to find some sort of middle ground, their trust in me would have boosted my confidence, and my sleep schedule would be much healthier. Maybe suggest that she can stay up half an hour later given that her phones in your room all night, and then if she keeps that up for a week or so (a week is a long time for a 12 year old) then maybe she can be trusted to keep it in the lounge room without you having to guard it. "
305, i love that omg im stealing 
306," i think its just less of an juggernaut now, before it was like A Whole Thing and now its just kinda... there? "
307," I had no idea there was an australian pride week, when is it? I might see if I can organise something similar for my school next year, its a really sweet idea "
308, it came with the 2 vinyl! 
309, my lord and saviour 
310," since its behind a mirrored sliding door I figured itd be a little excessive to have another one in here, so instead I get to admire mac demarco while I grab my products lol

i wear everything just about every day except for the eye shadows and lipsticks 

clockwise from bottom left:

box from inspired tribe

- mini bronzer

- concealer

- mini eyeshadow pallet (need to donate though)

- 3 liquid shimmer shadows

copper/glass display cube thing from target

- inside, behind the box lid, is deodorant and makeup remover, and an empty candle full of hair ties and bobby pins

- toner

- hair texture spray

- 2 perfumes

- mini dry shampoo

mirrored display tray from inspired tribe

- hair brush

- stick highlighter

- mini stick blush 

tealight candle holder from tree of life

- eyebrow pencil

empty candle from tree of life

empty candle from cotton on

- 3 mini liquid lipsticks (mistakes were made, Ineed to get rid of 2 of them lol theyre basically identical)

- full size liquid lipstick

and its all on top of a tapestry that ***wont stay up on my frickin wall UGH*** "
311, chicken stock? 
312,"  Gotta tease the pigtails

why has this never occurred to me before oh my god that makes so much sence "
313," you dont need to look at the rain to enjoy it. the sound along with the darker lighting outside is probably adding some really cool ambiance, helping make whatever shes saying even more dramatic and engaging for her friend "
314, [wow i cant believe that Aneka faked her death and became a breadtuber](https://imgur.com/a/mTKr9Ga) 
315," I used to have persistent hormonal acne on my chin, but thankfully now I only break out once or twice a year. Annoyingly though, theres still redness/spots left over from old pimples. Its not that bad and its easy to cover up, but it seems like it could be something that is easily fixed, I just dont know where to start.

The photos above were taken on a good day btw, about half the time its a fair bit more red.

**My current routine (normal-dry skin, 17F):**

AM:

**Grown Alchemist** *Hydra Repair Day Cream*

PM:

**Mario Badescu** *Seaweed Cleansing Soap*

**Grown Alchemist** *Hydra Repair Day Cream*

I used to use **The Ordinary** *Glycolic Acid 7% Toning Solution*, which evened out my skintone on the rest of my face, but it was too harsh and didnt do much for my chin so Ive stopped "
316," is this intended to be international? because I know my answers would be very different if I were from the US, but there doesn't seem to be any option to account for that "
317," not sure what you're trying to find out here, but I would think the decision to wear a helmet would come more from your socialization rather than biology, so I don't really see why you'd ask for biological sex when gender would most likely be more relevant "
318," there should probably be a midground between ""once a month"" and ""I've never played mobile games""

about once or twice a year I'll get into some sort of puzzle game for a couple days, and there's not really an option to say that "
319," I'm an ""Australian participant aged 18-29 years"" however when I answered as not religious, female, and homosexual and the survey ended. You should probably repost this with the correct demographics... "
320," I think a 3 day voting window would work better, with one of the days being a federal holiday, since some people will still be working/unavailable on that one day

or even just making it easier/clearer to submit an absentee ballot "
321," Only the ones youre close to, at my school some year 11/12 classes have like 3-10 people in them and those students usually end up keeping in touch with their teachers after graduation "
322," My friend group of 17/18 year olds plays board games at pre drinks before going out, and legit half the time well end up ditching the club/party just to keep playing "
323," idk, whenever I have good eyebrow/skin days Im almost kind of disappointed because it means I cant really unwind and do my ~routine~ "
324," Oh yeah its definitely much more drastic, but Im just saying I can understand how Jules could feel like she had to make the report "
325," I actually started to fucking tear up when he was going off at her, it was just too real. Ive never explicitly been monologued at like that by a dude before, but it was like he was saying everything Ive ever thought about myself as a result of the ways guys have treated me, and it was intense. "
326," As someone whos been in the exact same situation (blackmailed into not reporting a crime with the threat that I would be charged for CP because of nudes I sent at 15), I can tell you thank it is not at all unbelievable that Jules would go as far as shes gone to stay out of Nates way.

Teenage brains already are pretty terrible at seeing situations clearly, especially when you pile on the immense fear of being shamed and outed. Her reactions are realistic. "
327," to me at least, what pyjamas refers to depends on the context

Im going to buy some new pyjamas means explicitly clothing designed to be worn as sleepwear

whereas Im going to change into my pyjamas means anything that person wears to bed "
328, transgender isnt a gender identity... 
329, 40% 
330, FULLY 
331, I get soccer fuckboys and mac demarco-lites 
332," hey youre doing better than me lol

I only brush mine in the morning "
333, oh thats just your spidey senses 
334," Yes! Ive never had regular front cramps, its always in my lower back, like right over my sacrum

It makes period shits *extra* painful :D "
335, is there a difference between cervical mucus and discharge? 
336," the ones that wrap around to the front tho are **much less** satisfying to pull out

ouch "
337, its *super* american but the chapotraphouse podcast is really informative/entertaining once you get a hang of what it is exactly theyre talking about 
338," I can definitely see why it turns a lot of women off, but Im actually kinda into the fake moans lol "
339," Theres this guy from my high school who would go to house parties, discreetly take a shit under a rug, and then leave immediately. He made it like 5 parties before anyone caught him. Hes my hero "
340, yeah Im a D and my boobs are less than a handful (and my hands are pretty small) 
341, She makes really high quality political videos on youtube. If you have 20ish minutes I highly recommend you check her channel out 
342," I get the I could turn you straight bit often. The vast majority of the time its just a light hearted joke sort of comment and not an actual offer. So as long as that was the tone and she could read it, Im sure her reaction was at your lack of creativity rather than out of offence "
343, You dont look like a lesbian! 
344," Im the opposite! Im a lesbian but since Im single it doesnt come up much, and just about every other day Ill be talking to people Im out to and theyll start asking about guys and stuff and I just have to stare at them for a second before theyre all like oh shit I forgot "
345," Oh yeah definitely (and thanks for the recommendation ;)) but you have to go out of your way to find it.

The vast majority of lesbian porn is created by straight men for straight men with straight women performers. "
346, Sure but do you think that its made with that demographic in mind? A lot of lesbians watch lesbian porn but the majority of it clearly caters to straight men 
347," oh yeah nah dont get my wrong im glad you pointed it out, just a little defensive ahahah "
348," Private hospitals in Australia dont have an emergency department, and in a public ER, he would only have to wait if it was assessed that he was less in need of care than everyone else in the queue, and even then it wouldnt be 5 hours "
349, Honestly its worth a shot 
350," I can assure you, for me, it is absolutely needed "
351," No, anything under 104.7 is iffy "
352," oh fuck off, Im 4.7lbs underweight. Saying that thats healthy is just straight up incorrect. "
353," ahahah thanks but to defend my greasy hair for what its worth, all these pics were taken while Im on holidays, and the friend Im staying with does not own shampoo or conditioner 

i am truely struggling here lmao "
354, hey girl heyyyy ;) 
355," Everyone reacts to drugs differently, your experience is totally valid, but it does not reflect mine "
356, thanks for the tips! Ill try it out :) 
357," if you are actually seriously worried, I have to maintain my weight (or gain) with weekly weigh ins, and see a physiatrist every three months to stay on my ADHD meds

As someone about to sit their HSC, and then start uni, being medicated is more important to me than losing weight lol so staying healthyish is in my best interest "
358," People seem to think Im either 22 or 14, no in between lol "
359, I am aware lol 
360," wow, thank you!

Im pretty gay but hes always been on the very short list of guys I would turn for ahaha "
361," Thanks :) but you might want to check out the side bar, the rating systems a bit more spread out here than what people normally use "
362," Thanks! and yeah, but I like being small \\_()_/ "
363," Thanks :) but with the eyebrows, its the shape thats intense and thats 100% natural, the fake part is the colour, so without it they look much worse ahaha

Im sure if I got them threaded or waxed theyd look better but Im way too chicken for that ahaha and I kinda like the intensity anyway \\_()_/ "
364," look I get what youre trying to do here, but at least make your insults relevant to me ahaha

Im an easy target bud theres a lot you could go off here if you were even a little bit creative "
365, lmao what my eyebrows are fantastic 
366, also Im pushing my shoulder forwards in the middle photo ahaha I swear Im not a linebacker 
367," Thanks :) 

Yeah I definitely think I need to do something with my hair, Im super bored with it but Im totally lost as to what to do. I had a fringe for a bit and it looked great when it did what I wanted it to, but that was rare ahahaha now Im trying to grow it out into a [Cher Horowitz](https://images.app.goo.gl/tYhNAxPMDxCChSnY8) sort of thing but who knows how long thatll take lol "
368," thanks! I already wear a little bit of mascara and sometimes Ill put bronzer as eyeshadow, but Ive never done anything more since my lids are [weird](https://imgur.com/a/CxM7XEx) and hands are super shaky ahaha but it should be fun to practice, I love the look of eye makeup "
369, any tips on how to become eye catching? or is it like a you either have it or you dont thing lol 
370," Im Australian and in primary school we sang the national anthem before every major assembly, so about 6 times a year (awards, concerts, elections, ect) and in high school we also sing it first thing every monday morning, but thats after a welcome to country, and no one actually sings it "
371," I was diagnosed about 5 months ago and Ive been taking vyvanse (30mg for the first month, then 50mg since, but Ill probably go up to 70mg soon) and its been amazing. I havent tried anything else so I cant really compare it, but from what Ive read its great for most people "
372, A definition that makes sense to me is that sex is when consenting people are trying to get eachother off 
373," I think its because its more taboo to talk about vaginas than penises, so there isnt really an established standard

EDIT: also because having a good vagina (short pubes, small labia) doesnt impact PIV sex nearly as much as having a good penis (long, girthy) "
374, when you take vyvanse + have a sunburn 
375," thats the weird thing though, ive never had normal bulimia, Ive never been able to make myself throw up the traditional way ahahaha Ive seen specialists about it and everyones pretty lost but since its not doing me any damage and its painless its not really been a big deal

but still, thank you so much for your kind words  I seriously hope everything works out for you "
376," oh I have a fucked digestive system and i unintentionally regurgitate everything i eat, so it just kinda, comes back up and so its super easy to aim rip "
377," dude like a purging rn and theres a 4 finger gap* between the rim and the water


*goals lmao "
378," i get you, at home i throw up into water bottles and pour it into the toilet later but thats just because im lazy and disgusting "
379, refreshing! 
380," I have a big ass bruise on my hip from a 14 hour flight, like it looks like a walked into a table 

god im thicc "
381, i have a legit actual bruise on my hip from a 12 hour flight 
382," lmao same, its like the main reason I can't understand people who feel uncomfortable with they/them singular pronouns, ive used them to describe every single crush ive ever had in my entire life "
383, my parents did a similar thing and theyre still together 30 years later 
384, if youre not underweight it can only be diagnosed as atypical anorexia nervosa 
385," Im the same too

Im a lesbian, and one of the loudest, most opinionated people youll meet. I dont give a second thought to yelling at racists or transphobes, but as soon as someone says something homophobic I shut up. I just physically bring myself to say anything. I think its because *Im* in danger now. The same thing happens to a lesser extent with misogynists, I think its less intense though because while women are oppressed, there are much more of us around that other minority groups. "
386, I dont think ive ever typed a single sentence on my phone without making a mistake. In typing that sentence alone I make 6. I have shitty hands lol. 
387," idk about that, margret thatcher definitely could "
388, my mum does too she just doesnt know it lol 
389," I see a physiatrist for non-ed reasons and when I started vyvanse they weighed me because one of the side effects is weight loss. So since theyre concerned with your weight, Id assume theyd weigh you too "
390, wait whats the deal with chomsky? 
391, ahaha all good I get how that could be confusing 
392, ? no? Im a girl 
393," Youre younger than my little brother and also im gay (what I was saying is more what ive heard from my friends lol) so I cant say I find you attractive ahaha but nah youre a cutie

Dont really see the drug dealer thing you were talking about though, you just look like a normal kid to me

I can totally see you growing into your looks, not to say you look bad now, youre just super young. 

Its hard and cliche but try not to get caught up about this stuff too much, just be kind to yourself

sidenote though, youve got great skin now but if you start too get acne, get on that shit asap with a dermatologist. I started meds for my skin at your age and it changed my life, Im so glad I didnt ignore it because Ive seen how bad skin can really knock down people. Also your eyebrows are super nice, it can be weird for dudes but maybe think about shaping them when youre a bit older, its *crazy* how much good brows improve peoples looks "
394," a lot of girl find conventionally unattractive guys hot, especially if youve got that druggo look

source: am girl "
395," hey some girls are into that

https://imgur.com/a/60Ivla6 "
396, where do you live? im on a coast and most people here just hook up in a quieter part of the beach and no one really gives a shit 
397, yikes 
398," single, but I dont think I could deal with a real relationship "
399, that sounds like the wholesome munted lifestyle I need to adopt 
400, got any stories ahahah I think I might try to go there on exchange when im at uni 
401," lmao Ive told my friends that ill only smoke tobacco if its in an old timey pipe or cigar, just for the sheer energy it has lmao 

like the same vibe as being someones ex wife, or drinking champagne out of a glass not a bottle, or taking a bubble bath on valium

so elusive "
402," Ive actually seen alldeezy twice ahaha

Im not the biggest fan of his music and most people give him shit, but thats the same for all aussie hiphop. My friends were into him when we were like 13/14 and it feels like hes fallen off the earth a little bit since then though "
403," 1 can diet fanta to 2 shots vodka is my go to, 2 of them to get solidly tipsy, 3 to get smashed. Its taken me way to long to get here though, long gone are the days of chasing swigs of ruskov with no sugar coke, I am a refined woman now lmao "
404," yeah! like they both have a distinct ~ancient female~ vibe, lesbian sounds almost vulgar? while sapphic is more powerful and elusive


like someone you really want to be friends with but youre too scared to talk to them because they seem too cool for you


I should probably go to bed lol that doesnt make sense "
405," yeah but Im not sure why, it just sounds kinda gross to me? I really like sapphic though, but its not mainstream enough to use as a label :/ "
406," the messages part of the app is *sooooo* fucking slow on my phone, I got the notification but it hasnt shown up yet lmao hold ur horses "
407," ohhh that makes sense lol

13s a gross number to end on though ew "
408, Im just so bad at shooting my shot lmao teach me ur ways 
409," thats so wack

here everyone born in the same year (with 5-10% kids born early in the year after who are ready) is in the same year group from kindergarten to year 6 in primary school, and then 7 - 12 in high school. Year 12 finishes in October/November-ish and the majority of people are 18

It sounds like yous do a year less of school? Your stupid country is already so much better than ours, why does it have to keep getting better every time I hear about it "
410," yeah shit lol I definitely was a bit short sighted 

here I am complaining about people just missing the hint that Im gay, while bi ladies (especially those in a relationship/that are femme) have to deal with people full on believing theyre straight

again tho lmao this is why actual straight people shouldnt use , so straight passing bi girls can use it as a signal "
411," ok so hear me out, I know the alt-right are awful awful people *but* they sure do know how to make a good dog whistle, we may need to take some notes "
412," so you guys graduate high school before you turn 18? thats wild

what age do you start school? "
413," my birthday was on the 5th of june ahaha Im a normal age for my year, do you guys have a different system?

Ill be in year 12 in term 4 (october?) though since 11 is just 3 terms here "
414," yeah, like ive definitely noticed that now im in year 11 the people that werent interested in drinking before are warming up to it lol "
415, wack 
416," oh yeah definitely, I am not a healthy person lmao "
417, I always fast before drinking just to save money/taste less alcohol lmao 
418, trimmed pretty close but its more for personal comfort rather than aesthetics 
419," I go to a selective high school so thats definitely gonna skew my perspective, but I have heaps of derro friends so hopefully that evens me out a bit ahaha

most people start drinking in at the end of year 9, and from then everyone gets smashed every weekend lmao but for the most part people are aware of the risks and try to minimise them, like ive never heard of anyone drink driving, and most people i know keep track of their standards, mainly just to flex lol but still. Also most peoples parents are cool with it which is wonderful "
420," I just wish alcohol didnt taste so bad, its legitimately the main reason I drop caps

last weekend I did a shot and it immediately came back up, its like it bounced from my stomach straight into my mouth again

drugs would never do me like that "
421," honestly just do, it im a pretty gross person and it still healed super fast

I ordered all the stuff from amazon and it took my friend like half an hour to do it, it just feels like getting pricked by a bindi, but for half an hour "

427," yeah but as someone who is shit at both talking dirty and texting, it was not a good time "
428," luigi, bc ive always felt bad for him "

432," I dont really have anything, Im a pretty open person**

**read: chronic oversharer "
433," thats a good point actually shit

to kinda justify myself a bit tho this post was my reaction too some girls who I know for sure arent queer, and so thats why the possibility of them being bi never crossed my mind, but yeah nah ur 100% right "
434," A lot of people are put off tofo since its texture and flavour can make it tricky to prepare correctly at home. Try some at a restaurant first so you can get an idea of how it can taste when its cooked well, and if you like it you can focus on learning how to do it yourself :)

Also, if you are looking to lose weight, r/1200isplenty has some great low calorie recipes. However, 1200 calories is very low for most people, and the community can be a little worrying sometimes, so I would really recommend just using it for meal inspiration rather than getting super into the culture.

437, (theyre a trans man in this scenario) 
438," oh yeah its actually unbelievable that nothing bad happened and I probably wont do anything quite *that* stupid again but im glad I did it, it was definitely a learning experience, if you can do something similar without the illegal things and with a safety net (maybe tell someone where ur going lmao) than you definitely should "
439," snuck out to sydney for the night (alone) with a ticket for an 18+ gig I bought that morning. My ID didnt work but I had already taken 2 caps that were kicking in so I decided to try and keep the night going. I sort of just roamed around for a bit talking to groups of drunk people outside of bars/clubs. I jumped the fence to one and managed to stay there for about half an hours before getting kicked out, this guy left with me and I followed him to this car where he picked up like a shit load of ket, I did a bump and then left lol. I ended up finding this group of very wholesome looking friends on the side of the road, this huge dude was passed out cold and his 100lb girlfriend and this 55 asain dude were freaking out and didnt know what to do since no cab would take them and all of their phones were dead. I walked over and called the non-emergency line for them and had a chat, I gave the asain guy my number and told him to let me know how his friend goes. I took another cap and left. I found these two older (30s?) ladies outside of an karaoke bar and they snuck me inside to their work christmas party lmao which was honestly so fun. Then the asain guy calls me and asks if I want to meet at this one 24/7 maccas, and so I leave the bar and while Im waiting for him I get to talking to this group of very messy gay dudes and turns out one of them works for heaps gay and he gives me his number (he got me into his float for mardi gras a couple months later!) anyway so the guy I was waiting for shows up and he had 2 more caps and we took one each and its only then I realise that the last train was 4 hours ago lmao but its fine because this guy says that I can crash at his. Hes got literally the cutest little townhouse and we stayed up all night just hanging out and he taught me how to blow up my own nags so I can stop being a scab lol and then before we know it its 5am and the first train home is close, he walked me to the station and I got an hours sleep on the train. I caught a bus back to mine and told my parents the sleepover at my best friends house was fun lmao "
440," **a laser tag place**

its amazing 

i have the best job

you are correct in being jealous "
441," turn ons: playing with my hair/drawing on my skin (like with a finger not like actual markers thats messy smh) 

turn offs: being unnecessarily vulgar/sexual in a regular conversation, its just gross "
442," 23. theres literally so many my life is just loosely connected mortifications, i just have no shame? so its fine? most recent one though is that at a party friday night I wasnt home by when I said I would be and I wasnt answering my phone so my mum drove to my friends house and found me passed out on his couch with my tiddy hanging out of my dress next to a saucepan full of vomit, (that my hair had fallen into) and with a probably ER visit worthy hicky on my neck

the embarrassing part is that it was a work party. for my new job. "

459,"  I mostly use my ED as a way to avoid sitting with uncomfortable feelings 

shit I think youre onto something "
460," probably, my old phycologist though I had OCD, but since I was diagnosed with ADHD after that Ive just brushed that off as her being confused by the source of symptoms, but maybe she was onto something lmao "
461," its amazing right?


2 years ago I took a shit that had been brewing for an entire month (not ED related but bed ridden/drugged up/not eating) and oh my
god i think i understand how mothers feel. it was so painful but so rewarding "
462, oh my god i feel like im talking to my future 
463," nah I call bullshit

Ive got a very very weird digestive system though so maybe its just me "

also ooo whered the apple stuff come up? "

Im surprised I havent got anything in my comment history about that actually ahahha "
478," I know in australia its illegal since there was a kid got kicked off the bus for not having money who ended up getting kidnapped while he was walking to school

But I dont think youd have much of a chance actually enforcing any rules even if there were any where you live "
479," wanna go bonus points for specific podcasts?

503, women can vote now so bye-bye sexism 
504," I see where your coming from, and I used to feel the same. Im a cis lesbian and Ive had it explained to me by trans friends as similar to dyke

Its not *wrong* and some people even prefer it, but it makes a lot of people feel uncomfortable. So in my opinion at least, if theres a word you could use that doesnt risk make people feel that way,  using that instead is the polite thing to do. "
505, No worries! Ive found that the sub r/asktransgender is a really useful resource for this sort of stuff :) also the youtuber contrapoints has a couple of *really* good videos that have definitely helped me understand trans issues 
506, It was bad. Really bad. Lindsay Ellis has a good video on just how bad it is that explains it better than my illiterate self can if you really care 
507," Its not a huge deal and sorry to sound pedantic, but you sound like the type of person whod appreciate being corrected here

transsexual is a pretty outdated term, its not a slur or anything but since historically its been used by transphobes a lot of trans people are uncomfortable with it.

It also sounds like homosexual or bisexual, which can confuse some people into thinking its a sexuality.

Transgender or even just trans is the most accepted term :) "
508," I think it has a lot to do with that when you get older you mature into placing less of a value onto your looks, and that usually coincides with getting married "
509," Its kind of rude, I live in a pretty progressive area and youd be judged more for commenting on someones bralessness than you would be for going braless "
510," Im a 30D and I can run without a bra

It is my only skill "
511," Most have a not-lace lining :) 

If youre australian, cotton on body has cute bralettes for really cheap, especially if you get them on sale "
512," Sneaker culture isnt really big where I am, so its always confused me a little, can anyone explain the hype? I feel like Im missing out! "
513, believing someone is offended doesn't mean you think they are wrong for feeling that way

515," you'll have to check the rules, but you might have better luck posting in r/EDAnonymous r/EdAnonymousAdults or r/fuckeatingdisorders "
516," I think you put the wrong symbol next to 18, 

you have ""18"" which reads as ""greater than 18""

""18"" means less than 18

It's an easy mistake to make, good luck with your PIP :) "
517," do you mean dates as in the day, the food, or the social interaction? "
518," ""Do you think hyper-sexualization in advertisement has a negative effect?""

negative effect on what? "
519, have you ever even seen a nail salon? it's a lot more involved than filing/cutting nails 
520," kids at my school say that every time we get a syllabus or an exam notification, forgetting that we do financial math (which has a huge unit on taxes) from year 9 to year 12 regardless of what stream your in "
521," I remember when I was like 13 I heard that speeding tickets were based off your income in Finland, I thought that it was cool so i told my aunt (she was visiting from the US, Im australian) and asked why more countries dont have a system like that, and she said because thats socialism and didnt elaborate lol "
522, I think they mean the power of attracting puppies

525," if you think two people would be cute together, you ship them

its normally used in the context of fandoms, but people also ship celebrities, or people they know

idk if its just because im in different circles online now, but it seems like its being used less nowadays compared to a couple years ago "
526," no joke, almost every single guy Ive come out to has said something along those lines

It was funny at first but it just pisses me off now "
527," same ahaha I was going to say that Ive literally never met a girl that doesnt love strong girls, but then I realised not everyone is a lesbian rip "
528," the way I see it at least, is that boycotting or voting with your dollar is worthless, so go ahead and buy the merch. But try to keep it generic, dont buy shit with rainbow brand logos, since then youre promoting the brand and helping their image.

EDIT: actually scratch that can i change my answer to steal it lmao

529," YTA if you go out of your way to complain, but if its like ubereats and you get a prompt on the app after you receive your order, then youre totally justified in rating him poorly "

534, LUXURY 
535, When I was 11 someone put a message on my wall on Moshi Monsters asking if I was a 'lesbein' and I started crying lmao 
536," That mentality is so weird to me, theres like a clique of old ladies that hang out naked in the change room at my gym and I've always really admired them. I want to be comfortable with walking around naked whenever, not just when I'm 'feeling myself'. I wish I could just not give a fuck about how conventionally attractive my body is, and just appreciate it for just *being* "
537," shit fr? I should give k-dramas a chance, any recommendations? "
538," unfortunately you have to be over 18 to donate now :(, they changed it a couple years ago "
539," Thank you, I needed to hear that. "
540," I know, Ive had a revolving door of friends my entire life (no drama usually, I just like to float around and find it hard to connect deeply with people, definitely a quantity over quality approach lol) Lauras the one constant, but youre right, even if its hard I need to get over it and let it be. "
541," Your right, its just hard since I can feel us drifting apart, and I really dont want to lose her. Partly because I love her, and partly because I know shes the only person I feel comfortable being open with.

Sorry thats really got nothing to do with this, Im just kinda sad ahahah "
542," I definitely agree. I dont blame her for the other situations at all, I was upset at the situation, not her or her family.

Hence why I feel shitty for expecting her to bail on the concert, its not a good reason, especially from her friends perspective. "
543," Youre right, but to elaborate, I was only factoring her in since I felt bad that she had to miss out on the other things, since she had no control over being grounded (well I mean she could have not done thing things to get grounded but thats going back a bit far) "
544, Oh absolutely 
545, whats STV mean? preferential voting? 
546," NTA

 #x200B;

A nice person would give your friend more than the 100K, it's not the *right* thing to do, but it is the nice thing to do. But your friend sounds like a dick. Hes justified in feeling a little disappointed that you didn't offer the money, but he absolutely is not justified in feeling entitled to it. It would be a different situation if he was in financial trouble, but thats not the case "
547, Good luck in SAC! I'm planning my PIP right now lol 
548, dominos value range pizzas (australia) are 12 and 1000-1210 calories for the entire thing... 
549," I also find it strange when people use woman/man for 18/19 year olds

I know its technically correct, but I feel like teen and adult should be mutually exclusive "
550," Guys is also gender neutral, so it works when addressing a group of men and women.

Its only when used singularly that it becomes strictly for males that guy over there. Unfortunately, there isnt a direct female equivalent, and what you say really depends on the context. Lady is probably as close as you can get, but it doesnt have the same friendly connotations as guy "
551," Guys is gender neutral. Girls is not.

At my job I have to talk to large groups of people, and saying ok guys to get everyone to listen up has never made anyone feel confused or excluded, whereas saying ok girls, would.

If I were trying to address the men in the room separately, saying ok guys would not be effective. So I say ok boys/dudes, which is much more adjacent to ok girls than ok guys

Im kind of very tired at the moment so hopefully that was coherent, but do you get where Im coming from? "
552," only call a woman a girl if you would call a man a boy in the same context 

going out for drinks with the girls isnt rude, because going out for drinks with the boys is also a common thing to say

theres only one girl in the office is rude, because theres only one boy in the office is a strange thing to say "
553," How long have you had it for? I feel like I should want to get treated, but I dont? Like I dont think its actually doing my body any harm, and at its very worst its annoying so why bother spending so much time and energy trying to sort it out? "
554," THAT IS MY WORST NIGHTMARE HOW ARE YOU ALIVE

i had a glass full of puke on my shelf that I covered with a shirt because I didnt have time to get rid of it, and I forgot about it *for 2 months* and when I realised what I had done I just lifted the whole shelf off (removable slats) and threw the entire thing in the trash "
555, I talked to a specialist about it a while ago but the meds she gave me made me feel so gross (like you know when youre *about* to regurgitate but not just yet? but all the time) so I never took them and kind of just ignored it from then 
556, oh my god i do the water bottle thing too 
557, i drank a cup of tea before the salmon so honestly it probably really *is* the tea 
558," just say youre anemic, if youre a woman or a vegetarian/vegan no one ask any questions "
559," Youd think so, but In high school I had a part time job at a green grocers and worked 3 hours on friday and 4 on sunday. Honest to god it was the worst job Ive ever had in my life. If given the choice between working my second worst job full time and going back to the store at 7 hours a week, Id pick full time in a heartbeat "
560, How much vyvanse do you take? 
561," I went to the doctors to renew a prescription and as that was wrapped up she asked me if I had anything else I needed to ask about, and I said something along the line off um yeah actually sorry this is kinda weird but I was talking to my friends and kind of feel down a rabbit hole online, and I think I might have ADHD? and she asked why and I had a list of things I do that I thought could be explained by ADHD, and she said that she thought I might be onto something and gave me a referral to a physiatrist.

When I saw him, I had the list ready again but I didnt really need it since the questions he asked kind of covered everything. He saw that I had already been using the strategies he would suggest someone use before they try medication, so he felt comfortable in giving me a prescription then and there if I was comfortable. Before that I hadnt mentioned medication at all. 

He mentioned 2 other types of meds (definitely adderall, and either concerta or ritalin) but he said that he thought vyvanse would be the best for me, and even though Ive had to go up in dosage every single time I check in with him, he hasnt said anything about trying the others.

Im not sure why you want adderall specifically, but if its genuinely wanting treatment for ADHD, I reckon you should avoid asking for specifics and just let them decide what they think would be most suitable for you "
562," Im not sure how adderall XR differs from vyvanse, but Im on the latter and my physicist says that the dosage has nothing to do with your physical size and is just based on your metabolism. Were both the same age, but I (45kg 161cm female) take 50mg (probably 70 soon) while my friend (90kg 195cm male) has been comfortably on 30mg for a while now "
563," Yeah definitely, I always knew it was voluntary in the US, but I thought they were the outlier. It was only a couple months ago that I found out that only 12 other countries have enforced compulsory voting "
564, thanks! 
565, Isnt the clavicle just the top part though? Im more talking about the bit that goes down from it 
566, theyre pretty clearly being hyperbolic... 
567," The one percents money is reliant on there being a surplus of uneducated minimum wage workers for them to exploit. By forcing poor women to have children they neither want nor can afford, they lock her out of ever escaping the poverty cycle, and directly feed her children into a system that will ensure they never get the chance too either. Its the same mentality behind slashing education budgets and social security. "
568," That makes sense, thank you for explaining! "
569," So its not that shes comfortable with these videos, shes just decided that educating others makes it worth it?

Is that the same mentality behind people who could otherwise pass as cis, openly identify as trans? "
570, Have you checked out LGBT/trans subreddits? 
571," yeah, they both suck, so Everyone Sucks Here "
572," sorry if this is an obvious question but I know basically nothing about sports, whats the can of worms that comes with hormone testing? Dont that already have to undergo an assload of tests in antidoping measures anyway? "
573," I think you should spend some one on one time with them if you can, that stuff is usually really important to older people and you could really make them feel loved and important by going a little out of your way for them

I get how frustrating it can be to give up time you put aside for yourself, but I think its worth it in this situation "
574," INFO your friends reaction is really disproportionate to the situation, I feel like theres probably more too it

How old are you? Has he had an experience with drink driving in the past? How strict are the drink driving laws in your country?  Have you had an encounter with him in the past that could lead him to feel cautious around you for whatever reason? "
575," Honestly, I think that if OP really only wants a commitment relationship, they should get this stuff out of the way on the first date, that way its extra clear that its just blanket ground rules and not some weird control thing hes developed around that one individual "
576," Will you have any other chance to see your grandparents other than Monday? If you could, taking them out for breakfast Tuesday morning would make up for missing Monday

If you cant, and you end up staying in on Monday, I think asshole is a strong word, but it definitely isnt the choice a nice person would make "
577, INFO is there a reason why you cant destress on a different day? 
578," Im pretty sleepy so I probably didnt make much sense but I think youve misunderstood my comment

I was trying to say that you should make sure that when you bring up these dealbreakers, its clear that youre only trying to avoid wasting each others time, and youre absolutely not trying to establish any rules on your existing relationship. She may have reacted like she did because she misunderstood the situation, lots on people in this thread have "
579," I figured, but it was just too easy to go for I couldnt help myself lol

And I agree, Im agnostic and while most of the catholics I know are *very* into religious stuff, they tend to keep to themselves "
580," They bring up something worth mentioning though, are you sure that she didnt get the same impression as alexneverafter? Because that would make her reaction make a lot more sense, and it would make you a total asshole from her perspective "
581," At worst he gave him like a 20 minute inconvenience, I think thats a justifiable response "
582," ESH

hes a bigger asshole for disrespecting workers unprovoked, but a nice person wouldnt have fucked with him like that

sometimes youve gotta be an asshole though "
583,"   as a Catholic myself I've never once seen this play out

really? you, a catholic, have never been shamed by catholics for not being catholic? are you sure? "
584, oh god why didnt I see that before I made comments defending him 
585," Normally I would agree, but her previous relationship wasnt a typical one. It lasted her entire adolescence, and shes only been out of it for a year at the most. "
586," NAH I can see how you could be uncomfortable with the situation, as long as you were respectful in breaking off the relationship I dont see any issues here

12 years is already a very long time for anyone, but at such a young age its even more intense, even if it wasnt entirely committed and serious, it was during a time of serious development and growth for her. Personally, I think she probably needs to give herself time to fully process the situation and learn to more about herself before jumping headfirst into another relationship,

EDIT: Scratch all of that, I just saw your username, if your real issue is that you think shes any less of a person because of her relationship history, youre a massive, misogynistic asshole and Im glad for her sake that you broke up "
587," Its the same thing. There was so much backlash on reddit against Cardi B. Lots of comparisons to Weinstein and Cosby made by communities who criticise the #metoo movement, They dont give shit about victims, they just looking for an excuse to hate women/black people/sex workers "
588," yeah, hes a bad bitch "
589," Wow, pewdiepie? A broken clock is right twice a day I guess lmao "
590," And like, Im legitimately shocked that *no one* (well, with a large platform) is talking about this? "
591, how dare you do me like this 
592," If they really cared about victims of sexual harassment, they should be equally outraged with Tati for not speaking up sooner... "
593," Im an otter lesbian
- short
- cute
- aggressive
- likes holding hands and rocks "
594, I love josh and chuck! 
595," what protein bar do you eat, if you dont mind me asking "
596," I put that anonymous question snapchat thing on my story and someone wrote do you eat i worried, ed? and damn i have some newfound sympathy for james charles now that ik what its like to be e x p o s e d "
597, Not sure if it counts but I put bronzer over my freckles to make them stand out 
598," was it a private school? All the public schools in my area are super anal about uniforms being correct, but they never say anything about modesty

Ive gotten called into the office for having pink socks while my skirt was millimeters away from showing my underwear lol its so strange "
599, wait so just the questions? you dont have to check the photo matches? 
600," Im sure there are some women who are not devoutly religious who wear it more as a cultural thing, also they could be buying it as a gift for someone else "
601," I agree, but I need her to understand that and just telling her isnt working "
602," From normal, prescribed use? Do you have any more information about that? "
603, [heres the reddit post the articles about](https://www.reddit.com/r/newzealand/comments/bmwpmp/received_this_in_the_post_turns_out_my_littlest/?utm_source=share utm_medium=ios_app) 
604," Black People Twitter :)

this is the r/wholesomememes of r/blackpeopletwitter "
605, yeah ngl it was hard to fight the urge to take my own lunch money after writing that 
606," not that it really matters since its clear what youre saying, but if you care;

it would be grammatically correct to say cost $60 a year 

when youre talking about price of something, the word cost doesnt change in tense forms

eg; it costs/cost/has cost me five dollars.

however, if youre talking about the action of determining the price of something, costed is appropriate as past tense

eg; the project was costed (out) at $2.5 million "
607," As someone outside of the US It definitely taken a while to get into, mainly because Ive got no idea who theyre talking about 50% of the time lol. But there definitely are some great episodes that stand pretty well on their own "
608," kinda unrelated, but as someone with a pretty dry sense of humour, I really wish people would stop shitting on /s tags

sure they kinda kill the joke a little, but Id rather that over accidentally supporting a fuckwit "
609, Have you listened to the chapo [episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6rMYk3WhJ1hyZ5pZZ2g7uM?si=Hz6NY_SDTPq4NB0Voj3aYg) on unionising? 
610," I havent used it myself, but apparently the list of doctors in the r/childfree sidebar is a pretty good resource for not-shit doctors "
611," no way, Cher is undeniably camp "
612, I feel like those cheap mini paddle sponges that come with drugstore eyeshadow might do the trick 
613," yeah normally Im pretty up myself as far as /s warnings go, I think a lot of people need to get better at reading jokes

but this one got me lol, I spent way too long trying to find their twitter before reading your comment

sorry @ everyone Ive given shit to for not getting a joke "
614," Ive got a couple hours to kill, Ill try both and get back to you!  "
615," Hey, Kelly here, can confirm am not genius :( "
616," I agree, I only follow people I know, its easy to avoid toxic influencers and manipulative ads if you dont let them into your feed. I dont understand why people complain about this stuff when *theyre* the ones who decided to follow these accounts in the first place.

My feed is just photos and videos of friends, I dont get to see a lot of them as much as I would like and socials let us stay in each others consciousnesses, so were less likely to drift apart.

I post whatever I want, I dont think about likes, or themes, or followers, or whatever, its just a photo album of all the shit Ive gotten up to with my friends over the years. I really enjoy looking back on it, and looking back on my friends old posts and seeing how we all have grown as people over the years

Social media can be toxic and horrible, but only if you let it. "
617," Yes, but youre taken for secondary testing at the station before anything is set in stone "
618," Too bad. No one is forcing you to drink. If you dont have a way home, or a place to crash, dont drink. "
619," I literally have no idea, Ive always had pretty alright body image, Ive never been through anything traumatic, I honestly think its an ADHD thing. Like, not eating and being thin is just something I *have* to do "
620, justcico.com 
621," im whomst 

end me "
622," hi illiterate pore here,

whats large branding? "
623, r/breadtube 
624," both and neither, were informed and angry "
625," gen Z are the ones organising the international student strikes for climate action, theyre not stupid "
626, Its Thursday for me right now! Time is wack 
627," masterchef (australia at least) is actually really wholesome, Ive never seen a contestant not go out of their way to support another competitor, even in eliminations. Its basically just nice people cooking; the show

literally every other australian reality show though? absolute garbage "
628, most people brush their teeth for 2 minutes a day but I cant remember that last movie I watched that felt the need to keep that detail in the final cut 
629, its tagged as everyone but not all countries use GPA 
630," Her mum knows shes going to have sex anyway, shes just trying to lessen the amount of opportunities they have to do it so pregnancy is less likely "
631, google is free 
632," my first girlfriend realised she wasnt gay after a month of dating me

i know ur pain "
633, But he is actually a neo nazi though... 
634, ;) 
635," Thats a good idea, I think ill just go with neutral/positive observations to keep the peace ahahah but thanks :) "
636," I agree and I wish I could just be equally rude back, but theyre my family and ultimately good people, Its just easier for everyone if I people please

Only 18 more months until I graduate and can leave the state  "
637," Sorry I probably should have mentioned; Ive gone from a BMI of 20.8 to 17.8, and the comments arent wow youre so skinny! its youve lost a lot of weight 

the reason I dont see it as concern is because they never bring it up privately, or ask if Im ok. Its just I can see your hipbones. How was your brothers soccer game? "
638," I got my fakie through literally just DMing every 18+ year old white girl I had a mutual friend with, it took a lot of messages but eventually I got a perfect match for 20AUD "
639, the reminds me of let my baby stay by mac demarco :( 
640," Yeah, it comes in a can like hairspray, but with more pressure. Its some sort of powder that absorbs the oil in your roots. Definitely not a replacement for real shampoo but its great when you dont have time for a wash, especially if you have short hair/bangs. "
641," dude, Ive done 800mg before (tested) with no comedown "
642,"  and yes, I know a dose this high is neurotoxic, I dont need the spiel "
643," That came out weird, Im a lesbian too, its not very often that I see love stories that I can relate too \_()_/ "
644, lmao whats smear the queer? 
645, oh Im talking about high school 
646, I cried the entire time because lesbians are adorable 
647," Its not that serious, normally its just people who are a little socially awkward because 

a) no one laughed at their joke and they think its because no one heard them

or,

b) people did laugh and they think saying it again will make them laugh more, because hey, it worked the first time "
648," Is he doing anything to fight against it? If he is, hes got my respect

But the systematic failures of 
 law enforcement arent something that can be changed by individuals, it will take a complete overhaul, so good cops working individually within that system can accomplish nothing "
649, Im not telling them to change their profession 
650," Its different for everyone, 3 months is just a safe blanket number. If youre really worried, just take a longer break next time "
651," definitely talk to your physiatrist about your drug use, they should let you know about any extra risks/things to be aware of that come with the meds "
652, why dont you become a paramedic or firefighter then? so you can help people without being a bystander to abuse and corruption 
653, a g in australia is USD110-130 and its pretty rubbush :( 
654," it depends what you want out of it, youll be taking 180 anyway so its really just a matter of choosing either a hard roll or a long roll, if its the latter, the redose is a good idea "
655," Itll work but its a little overkill, but hey, better to be safe than sorry "
656," 
I put mine in my undies lol the little crotch pocket thing is the perfect size "
657," thats actually a really good way to put it, "
658,"  only dated those guys who already graduated high school 

Thats the part I was referring too ^ but as someone who was preyed on by senior guys as a freshmen (Im Australian so our school years are different, but I was 14 and they were 18) I can tell you that their behaviour was undeniably predatory, even if it was legal "
659," Unfortunately the ACT isnt reflective of the rest of the states :( 

The NSW state government is awful, recently theres been a massive increase in sniffer dog and police at festivals, concerts, and the train stations nearby, its disgusting, people are getting strip searched and kicked out with no evidence to support them having/being on drugs. All this shit is likely to settle down when leadership changes, but the conservatives just won the election so its going to be a while :/

To be fair though, the punishments for actually being caught with drugs is pretty lenient/reasonable (well, compared to the US) they only really crack down on producers/large dealers. 

Were also super strict on border security since our ecosystem is so fragile, so just about everything that comes into the country is screened making it almost impossible to get drugs online, and while that is frustrating, its a tiny price to pay for preventing invasive species and all that stuff so its hard to be too mad "
660," basically in 2017 the conservative party was in power and decided to hold a nation wide survey asking if SSM should be legal, and you had to be enrolled to vote in regular elections, so thousands of young people registered

So now the conservative party is fucked because young people vote against them, and theyre the reason we now have a record high number of young voters "
661, same-sex marriage 
662," same as missing any regular day of school, its not a huge deal but it goes on your attendance and your parents are told "
663, evey gig/festival Ive ever been to has had free water (Australia) at groovin the moo last year they gave out free soft plastic water bottles (with a carabiner so you could clip it to your clothes) and had refill stations all over the grounds 
664," I think the word youre looking for is necessity but life demand both sounds cooler and fits better, so Im going to start using it "
665," 10 - 13 is definitely an appropriate age to start being more self sufficient, obviously it varies from kid to kid, but as long as you keep an eye on how theyre handling it, theyll be just fine :) "
666," Groovin the Moo! It tours to 6 regional Australian cities, but the pill testing is only available in Canberra. This will be its second year running, [last year](https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-30/groovin-the-moo-pill-testing-finds-lethal-product/9710112?pfmredir=sm) 85 pills were tested and 2 were found to be deadly, everyone who got a pill tested was given an armband, and none of them ended up having to receive any medical attention. The staff at the tent also consulted with 128 people about drug use. The main problem though is that the tent was very hard to find, I didnt take any pills last year so I wasnt really looking for it, but there were no signs or anything, another problem was the police presence, the cops had to vow not to target people at the tent/with armbands, but I didnt know about this until *after* the festival. One arrest was made but it was a guy with 18 pills and some powder, so not just some unluky kid at least. Overall it was a huge success and I really hope it can spread outside of the ACT! "
667, do you know if any is lost from being spilt out? my caps are pretty full so idk if i should move one to a bigger container 
668," I have. I ended up having a very interesting night. Ill never do it again, but Im glad I had that experience. I learned a lot about myself and had a super fucking fun time with strangers, but I was way too trusting of people and my guard was non existent, as a young girl alone in a large city, that is not a smart way to be lol "
669,"  like a predator 

that might have something to do with the fact that they are predators "
670," at my school all students have to come and watch, luckily theres only 140 in each year, but still "
671," I have freckles in a W shape from my cheekbones to my nose, and I absolutely love them. In winter though they fade a little, so I put bronzer over them and it makes me look so cute and sunkissed 10/10 for freckles "
672," I agree with orange_bunny, but if it really bothers you, look up some drag eyebrow tutorials, that way you can hide your real ones and redraw them where you think they should be, itll be very rough but it should give you enough of an idea about if you should regrow them or not "
673, stila liquid shadows! it literally takes like 2 seconds to you look like you have your shit together 
674, this is way late but logging exercise doesnt effect the amount of calories it says you burnt for the day 
675," Thanks so much, this is all really helpful, Ill definitely make sure Ive got some savings to burn through for those first couple weeks but it sounds like I should be set once I get my foot in the door "
676," I definitely will, cheers dude "
677, aw for real? are most jobs cash in hand or something? 
678," Thanks for letting me know, Im from Wollongong and Im under 18, so I have no idea what the job markets like in a different state, as well as in an industry that Ive never been able to look into before \_()_/ "
679, thanks for the recommendation :) 
680," I thought it was caramel at first

*shudder* "
681, oh my god that [comment](https://imgur.com/a/zNqFems) 
682," it took her a while to understand what she was asking because she had a fucking accent

jesus, get some reading comprehension "
683, woah you look so much like syds vids (youtuber) 
684, 15M? 
685," 17M, but id believe you if you told me you were a stone butch "
686," NTA their friendship is not your responsibility, if the girl youre currently talking to decides that she thinks a relationship with you isnt worth risking a friendship with your ex, she wont start a relationship with you, simple as that "
687," YTA you shouldnt wave people through, its incredibly dangerous to override road rules "
688," fuck dude its about being polite, now I realise that I read a little far into it and assumed that OP lives with their mother, but my general verdict still stands, if he decides to eat meat today and makes a point to make sure she knows, he is an asshole "
689," YTA

you have to realise that your mum legitimately believes her religion and seeing her own child turn away from it has got to hurt. You knew eating meat would hurt her feelings, and yet you still did, and for what? to make a statement? shit dude youre why people think all atheists are jerks "
690," Invisalign only works for very minor issues though, it cant bring teeth down or fix your bite "
691, $UPDATE $27.53 Brandywine Pizza delivery 
692, $update 
693," As long as it does everything you need it to do and your doctor is happy, the only thing that matters about your body is how *you* feel, be kind to yourself and treat yourself like you would a best friend. If you want to shed a little bit or weight so you can *personally* feel more comfortable, go for it! but do exercise you love and eat foods that will give you all the nutrients you need. Take your time and focus on the journey, not the destination. "
694," Your skin really isnt anything bad for a teenager, but if it bothers you definitely talk to your doctor about what they think is a good way to handle it 

Just from your face it looks like youre a little bit heavier, but again, its really not bad at all and there definitely are girls who prefer cute to hot, it makes you look more approachable. But if you want to go for a more chiseled look, it doesnt look like a lot of weight to lose so it should be pretty easy

Overall you are definitely not ugly, just going through a little bit of that awkward state everyone has when theyre in high school, legit 100% if you keep taking care of yourself you will grow into your looks and be very attractive in a year or two "
695," Heels are wild, Im 53 and a womens 7, and my 6+ dude friends cant fit into my boots/sneakers, but they fit into my heels just fine *I dont understand* "
696, /r/creepyPMs has some submissions from underage people 
697, /r/samplesize is great for survey responses! 
698, your pizza post was removed but if you still want some PM me ur deets my guy 
699," Im assuming youre in high school? I know how you feel, and its so awful that you have to go through this. Im in year 11 and Im so fucking done with everyone here, but I keep telling myself that theres only 6 terms left and then Im free. Teenagers are awful so please dont take anything assholes say to you seriously, I know its clich to say this but it seriously is just a projection of their own insecurities. Everything will be better when its over. Whats really helped for me is focusing on blocking everything out and focusing on doing my own shit. "
700," also this is kinda weird but Im actually that jealous of your eyelids lol, mine are kinda hooded and I would kill for that much space, its just so pretty "
701," Im getting the token girl lead singer in a band full of guys vibes, like sure you may not be VS model drop dead stunning, but you know for a fact that every dude in the bands got at least a little bit of a crush going on. Youre cute, and your hair and clothes make you look really relaxed and cool, like someone youd want to be friends with if you saw them on the street. "
702, [omg jamie is that you?](https://i.gifer.com/OoxL.gif) 
703," nope, Im the total opposite, when my BMI is below 19, my cheekbones and jaw get super strong, I can actually see my eyelids, and my skin clears up

Its the main thing that stops me from even considering recovery "
704," YES

I started vyvanse a few months ago and for the *first time in my entire life* I know what its like to not have an appetite, its insane to me that there are people out there who feel like this without drugs lmao "
705," Normally I can stop a binge in its tracks by drinking 1L of water, going for a walk, and drinking tea (with milk and sugar) or hot chocolate, this kind of eliminates the possibility of it being a boredom/craving binge, and lets me feel a little more comfortable with eating more since I feel like I need it. So if Im still struggling after all that, I decide how many calories im ok with, normally at or slightly above my TDEE, and I make sure to drink loads of water in between foods. Once I hit my limit I have another mug of tea/hot chocolate and go to my room to get away from any other foods, I never eat in my room so that I dont associate being in there with food.

What works for me is changing the urge to bing away from being a loss of control, and instead towards a form of fucked up self care, 

I remind myself that eating around my TDEE for a day will not make me gain real weight, its just like pressing the pause button on losing, and that the reason I want to binge is because my body needs nutrients, and because I cant eat this much every day, I need to be mindful about my choices. "
706," Ask her how shes doing, and open with telling her about your ED, being vulnerable with her will hopefully make it feel less like an ambush. Mention that youve noticed that shes been behaving in a similar way to how you have, and that youre a little worried. Let her know that she doesnt have to talk to you, but if she did, all you would do is listen and support her, you would never try and force her to do anything she wasnt comfortable with.

Depending on her personality, it might be best to send this as a text, I know I personally wouldnt let you get past the first sentence IRL, but I would hear you out if I had time to read and gather my thoughts.

Youre a really good friend for doing this, I hope everything goes well for both of you  "
707," The pledge is insane, but were not much better, most public schools sing the national anthem at assembly every week... "
708," My ideal future looks like this:

Me and my partner both work part time and make enough to get by without stress. My job is challenging but not demanding. I have plenty of time to myself. We have a huge dog that is very well mannered, and no kids. "
709," it means I throw up a lot more than everyone else, but I do that already anyways lol "
710, but then theyll take it upon themselves to fix it and honestly i do not have the emotional energy to deal with that buffoonery 
711, Ive had this conversation so many times and it doesnt get any less hilarious 
712, who cares? theyre not trying to pass it off as OC 
713," yep same here

if Im not eating Ill drown everything I cook in oil so I wont touch it, even if I go full binge mode "
714, For Harriet is great 
715, Report her 
716, [me](https://imgur.com/a/DFRDaI2) 
717," dimetapp is delicious omfg

i would fake being sick as a kid so i could get a taste lmao "
718, talk about diabulimia 
719," so im laying down in the bath right now, and my stomach is pulsing, like the water in my bellybutton is moving, its actually like throbbing up and down with my heartbeat hmmm what

anyone else have this? its wack "
720," ok sorry, but im gonna be that bitch

why spend double the money when you can just *refill* it

its *water*

*what* "
721," thats LuLaRoe, Lululemon is a legit brand with stores and employees and stuff "
722," i have devoted like 6 years of my life to my eyebrows, thank you for appreciating them "
723, omg i just stalked ur account a little and dude were both ADHD **L**GBTs with EDs lol 
724, caffeine pills? so youre not getting your caffeine from a liquid and can drink more water instead 
725," dude thats fucking not ok. you shouldnt have to be with someone who doesnt care about your wellbeing, youre worth more than that. "
726," I did wrist checks before I developed an ED,  i fidget with my hands a lot and they end up on my wrist sometimes \\\_()_/ "
727," for me the walking is really just useful as a way to practice mindfulness, so in your case maybe the traditional sit down and do nothing method is the way to go (god knows i do enough of that already lol)

and with water, for me having an app to log how many times i finished my drink bottle was insanely helpful, i used Daily Reminder - Drink Water, but now i just use my fitbit "
728," he probably meant it would be too oversized

like in his mind he was probably thinking a L would look cute as an ariana grande oversized thing, and so an XXL is *a little too big* and might look more lazy than adorable "
729," were basically the same person lol

Ive found that going for walks (without calorie burning in mind) has really helped me relax and lower my RHR, its like meditation its crazy

also I drink 4L of water a day, so that is also probably helping, drink more water hoe

ur skin will thank you "
730, giant ass diet coke 
731, literally the main reason why Im only looking at universities that are out of state lol 
732," You look amazing in the 3rd pic, which I feel like is probably closest to how you look irl (natural lighting, comfortable smile, relaxed face)

 having defined and shorter/flatter brows would really elivate your look, right now they widen your face and are overpowered by your (stunning btw) eyes "
733," improvements, comments, numbers, whatever, are all welcome :) "
734," its hard at first but once you break in a solid pair of well fitting jeans, you will never go back to your baggy ways ahahaha "
735," dont listen to that other guy, sure you dont have conventionally attractive features, but that just means your face is more remarkable too look at, not that youre unattractive

If you want to look a little more rugged/masculine, I would recommend growing your hair out a bit and keeping it shaggy, its a gorgeous colour and would really compliment your freckles nicely if there was more of it :) 

**all** men have a shitty time on online dating sites, dont let that get you down, its a terrible indicator of how attractive someone is "
736," Im getting your friends cool dad vibes from the zip neck, beard, and boots, and ngl I dig it 

Maybe try to get some jeans that fit a little more snug, youve spent a lot of time working on your body, dont hide it behind baggy denim "
737, it does now  
738," shit dude! I wish I could say the same ahah

but seriously who cares about the details, the only thing that matters is that you did. not. binge. even if you didnt have 100% control over the situation, now your body knows that its capable of moderation around fear foods, which is so important "
739," I get told by girls that Im pretty and guys say Im hot, but neither of them treat me like they treat other girls that receive the same description. I think my face is nice when its still, but the way I talk and move is unattractive and weird so it morphs into something much worse "
740," I get so obsessive about my tear troughs, its insane

Like, theyre hot on other people, but I feel like my face is way to wide or something so it just makes me look puffy and fat

Whats annoying is that they only go away when I get 9+ hours of sleep, and I cant physically do that when Im restricting because of the stims/hunger lmao, but when Im not restricting I lose my jaw and cheekbones which is even worse

Anyone want to donate to my gofundme for fillers/sedatives? lmao "
741," you know those models that dont have conventionally attractive features but it doesnt even matter because they have this aura of effortless cool that makes them a million times more gorgeous and interesting than any VS angle? i want that vibe

I reckon Ive only got like 2 or 3kg to go until I hit peak cheekbone prominence lol "
742, me @ every1 when they ask me why ive filled up my 1L drink bottle 4 times today lol 
743," I feel you

I swapped alcohol for caps and coke, and I got my vyvanse bumped up from 50mg to 70, just to avoid calories "
744, my heart is literally broken how dare she 
745," you never *have* to weigh yourself, and it sounds like it would be awful for your mental health regardless of the number, so its really probably best not too 

could you put it somewhere where you cant see it or take out the batteries? "
746," im babysitting this 8 year old but her 13 year old sister was home for the first half hour and she was next to me when I was making tea (for *myself*) and jfc she had a problem with everything that mugs too big oh my god thats way too much sugar you put *that* much water in? thats hardly any milk its too hot

SORRY WHERE DID I ASK? "
747," Really? Maybe its just where I live and the circles Im in, but since like 2016, I feel like non-intersectional feminism is no longer accepted as feminism by the vast majority of feminists "
748," I think it is possible to recover, but the amount of work and devotion it takes varies greatly from person to person, which can make it feel impossible to those who have a predisposition for it to be harder, if that makes sence "
749, whenever i sit against a wall or a chair with a hard back i can feel my spine stabbing into it and it makes me feel like a stegosaurus lol 
750, vyvanse would work but idk how you can get it without a prescription 
751," that is so incredibly dangerous. if you really to dehydrate your skin take diuretics, but thats not how lose skin works anyway "
752," I live near the beach so it would definitely be more prominent here than elsewhere, but about 20% of girls my age have a 17-18bmi, and 75% are 19-22, very few people are overweight. Ive only seen a few girls influencer bodies/sub 16bmis irl though, one of them is on my waterpolo team and its torture lol "
753," sorry im sleepy and reading comprehension bad, but i think youre mixed up

a cup of cooked oatmeal weighs less than a cup of uncooked oatmeal, and therefore has less calories, not the other way around "
754," Are you doing IF to reset your hunger queues or like something else like that? It just seems like it would be a lot easier to eat 3 spaced out meals

Sorry if that sounds really rude ahaha Im just curious "
755," the second I get home from school

you know that thing where how you suddenly NEED to pee as soon as you get to your front door? I get that with food lol

normally if I can ride it out for an hour Im good though, Ive started just making myself go for a 6k walk before I have time to make any food 

side note: walking is amazing where has this been all my life? ED aside, its like meditation, my head gets so clear and my body feels so... good? idk words are hard, anyway walking 10/10 "
756," ngl, whenever I visit my mums family in NC (Im from australia) I almost get cut that I dont live over there

Ill go to my cousins school and all the popular girls have a BMI of around 24 and people think theyre hot, meanwhile the equivalent of those girls in my area have an 18ish BMI

I could be so fucking remarkable over there lol "
757," chances are, 1700 is below or at your TDEE, so today was just like hitting the pause button on losing weight

please dont be so hard on yourself. youre not going to gain, its physically impossible "
758," I dont know, I used to feel similarly but [this](https://youtu.be/Pal2rPy9DsQ) video changed my perspective if you want to check it out "
759," You deserve so much better than a piece of dirt like him. He is a genuinely bad person and nothing you do, nothing you change, is going to fix that. I know it hard, but babe, you need to get out while you still can.

Do you have any friends or family that can support you while you deal with things? "
760," Im 53 as well and even with walking 10k+ steps and 20 minutes of (intense) cardio a day, my TDEE is only like 1800, it stoopid "
761," ive really been feelin myself lately and yalls i just took the cutest selfie and damn i really did that 

lmao @ my ed for turning my confidence into fuel bc now im thinking about how much i need a cute body to do my cute face justice

this is healthy "
762," day to day really doesnt matter all that much, what does is weekly intake. this week, you ate less than you burnt, thats all that matters. you have to eat 3500 calories over your TDEE to gain a pound, and even on sunday you ate less than that, any weight gain youre experiencing is water retention babe try not to let it get in your head  "
763," If a kid isnt turning in homework, and the first the parents hear about it is when they fail the class, the teacher has failed. "

765," Its approved as a treatment for binge eating disorder (BED) and is used to stop binges, not as a weight loss method  "
766," NTA

but Im worried for you. You say that since youve started dating youve distanced yourself from your friends, and now hes flat out not allowing you to hang out with them. I dont know all the ins and outs of your situation, but your partner should not be controlling who youre spending time with. If I were you, Id talk to him about how he needs to trust you with these guys, and how important it is for you to stay friends with them. If he doesnt respect that, you should probably seriously reconsider your relationship. "
767, this is the most perfect starter pack i have ever seem oh my god 
768, is that the trans one? 
769, 15% of american girls start puberty at 7...

772," dude what? maybe in 2012, but everyones seemed to accept them as mainstream now

a better example would be mac demarco, tame impala, rex orange county, or clairo "
773, scene has literally never been mainstream... 
774," Ill never pirate an independent content creators work, but Hollywood is a burning turd and I dont want any of my money fuelling it.

and also, stealing implies that I am taking an item from someone, but whoever I got it from still has that item after I pirate it "
775," all of my schools HSIE (i think the US equivalent would be geography, social studies, and history) teachers are like this, its actually really hard to come by good science teachers here for some reason "
776, Did I ask? 
777," people who pirate know that theyre putting themselves at a higher risk of downloading something funky, so theyre more likely going to take more precautions to protect their privacy than someone who doesnt

(also sorry side rant but piracy isnt stealing) "
778, unrelated but how did you get the text under the image to appear like that? (reddit mobile) 
779," I wasnt trying to insult you, theres nothing wrong with not being slim. I was just pointing that its not actuate to describe your body type like that. Itd be the same as someone calling you overweight or tall, youre just not. "
780," yeah, their comment is just continuing the bantz "
781," in ratatouille, you *were* AMAB, but transitioned to female as soon as you stopped growing

792," My TDEE ranges between 2200 and 3200 depending on my activity, and at first it was so hard to believe but ive lost 0.9kg a week at a 1000 calorie deficit according to my fitbit using those numbers, so its correct

its insane that Im losing at the same rate eating 2000 calories a day that I did at 500 a day + fasting, and its all because of exercise

I feel so much better, my walks are like meditation and cardio makes me feel so powerful. All the food Im eating has given me so much energy and I look... nice, for once.

I think my relationship with food might be slowly recovering "
793," its not sexualising her, and theres nothing identifiable in the photo, so not really? "
794," ESH if you were a pedestrian jay walking wouldnt be that big of a dick move, but you had your bike with you, which makes you much less mobile

804," Mines 90, Im 16, a smidge underweight, and have always been active, so Im a little lost as to why its so high, one positive though is that since theres so much room for it to go down, I can really focus on making it one of my goals "
805," I just got a fitbit, and Im making myself eat what they recognise as a 1000 calorie deficit. Im eating so much and its terrifying, but Im giving this a chance. I should lose 0.9kg by the 6th, and hit my UGW by the 27th if this is accurate.

If anyones had any luck with fitbit counts please let me know ahahaha "
806," Im 16 and in australia the drinking age is 18 but you have to card all under 25s, I only get asked for ID ~50% of the time and it kinda hurts a little lol "

808," If youre really bothered by it, mention to one of them that if they want to report him, youll back them up, but otherwise leave it at that "
809," NTA given the circumstances, youre completely justified in feeling how you do about your father. If he wants you to love him, he needs to show you that hes changed. Its up to him to make it up to you, you dont owe him anything. "

824," Im a lesbian so maybe its not the same, but my taste is women is not *at all* reflected in my taste in porn

I like all girls, but I have a soft spot for cuties with 22-24bmi, but all the porn I watch is of super tone/thin women since theres not really a mid ground between that and BBW, you kinda have to pick one "
825, have you ever been able to maintain? i cant see myself ever being able to 
826," Im really sorry if this is intrusive and I can delete my comment, but I stalked your post history and babe, youre both 17 and your financial/living situation is incredibly stressful. Guys already have fucked hormones/sexual responses at that age, which often leads to situations like yours through nothing other than biology, and that combined with the insane pressure hes under, both from wanting to please you and from wanting to live, makes it a perfect storm for this sort of thing.

I can assure you, hes not lying. Youre boyfriend loves you, and he loves your body. "
827," you have to eat over your TDEE to gain, 600 calories is, at the *very least*, half of your TDEE 

you will not gain real weight. its physically impossible. if the scale goes up its water retention. you will not gain real weight. "
828, it says blue right there in the post 
829, that makes so much more sense! i remember hearing it for the first time and wondering how the fuck moving more is appealing when your too drunk 
830," *Please* be mindful of your words. I get wanting to vent, but this is a support sub, and what you said could be so harmful to people trying to recover.

theyre so damn good "
837, all my internalised homophobia is 100% from me being resentful for not being able to become the dick sucking legend I have the potential to be 
838," I just came back from the gym, for the first time ever I didnt wear a top, just booty shorts and a sports bra, not only that but it was after an entire day of eating/water. Its so weird, I didnt hate myself for once, I actually felt really comfortable and confident.

This is strange. "
839, memes r over at r/edanonymemes my guy 
840," for protein you try to get at least 0.8g/kg body weight, chicken and tofu are super high protein/calorie

and try to get as close to 5 serves of veg per day as you can, 250g of frozen mixed veggies is 5 serves for 200 calories and is super cheap and easy to prepare "
841," Blue Ribbon just released a low cal line, same amount of protein, slightly less calories, and $8 per pint at coles  "

the recommendation is 0.8-1.2g per kg of body weight "
843," I sit one seat away from to these two girls in math, all they talk about is tumblr/MPA proana garbage while eating sweet potato and oatmeal

every. single. lesson.

Im not triggered by them talking or the food, Im fucking annoyed by how rude and inconsiderate it is, people are trying to learn here 
 "
844," it could also be from water retention, if you are dehydrated or ate a lot of carbs/sodium the day before, youll hold on to water weight and the scale will go up

calories dont lie, as long as youre eating less than you burn, your losing. There are way to many variables going on to *just* focus on the scale "
845," oh my god really? that sucks, where are you from? "
846," mine wasnt at first but then I developed it from the sore throat, definitely go to the doctors and get some antibiotics it cleared up so fast "

851," my friend has maintained a bmi of 18 since she was like, born, and she has one brownie every day, just one. and shes satisfied

she makes and freezes them every 2 weeks so that means that every 2 weeks she is in a house with an entire tray of brownies. and. only. eats. one. how the fuck- "
852," the site I got it from has 2 formulas, this is the female one, sorry I should have mentioned "
853," ive mentioned it a couple times and its never raised alarm bells, I do have a family history of autoimmune issues though so I might keep more of an eye on it, thanks :) "
854, a banana? what is that? like 2000 calories? 
855," my resting bpm is like 90 lol, idk why but ive always had a pretty fast heat rate

maybe im dying? who knows
but at least im burnin them calz "
856," Why do you think they shouldn't have performed there? Dubai certainly doesn't need the economic support from them being there, and any other implied support is negated by the performance since it criticises Dubai government.  "

 #x200B;

um excuse me but this is not what i asked for "
858, Cherry and grape tomatoes are amazing never speak to me again 
859," shit dude considering how much good food there is at parties you really shouldn't feel bad about 500 measly calories, I know this isn't worth much but please try not to purge, it was just one night and even if you had already eaten your TDEE before the party (and every day for the past couple of days), its just 0.14lbs gained

 #x200B; "
860, ohmygod I thought she was full calling you out with the mia thing until that last sentence there 
861, My mum cried when I asked to get my septum pierced lol 
862," yeah after typing that comment I realised I completely neglected lourna jane since their store near me is absolute garbage, but online they have heaps! I just ordered the To The Max bra so fingers crossed it fits lol

 "
863," I think I found them, do they mainly sell shoes? also thankfully shipping surprisingly cheap here! "
864," Thanks! Im Australian and we have like nike and lourna jane, thats it lol, time to check out brooks! "
865, Oh actually are you talking about ones with a zip? Ive seen a couple of them around but idk it feels like it could come undone pretty easily 
866," Im just so lost here ahahah, thanks for the info! "
867," Thanks for the recommendations! Sidenote; fuck brands that don't show a back view of the product when you hover over them, I don't want to open an entire page just to be heartbroken at the close-less back  "
868, I know right? I feel alienated in a lot of far left circles because Im anti-gun lol 
869," cant we just all agree to all have kids at the same time of year so we can get this bullshit over with?

I nominate december since weve already got food holidays there anyway, just turn it into intentional binge month

871, ngl as someone who only weighs once a week that sounds like a dream (if you ignore the whole everything else that comes with that part lol) 
872, babe i dont even know what to say other than that fucking sucks  
873," do you have access to a pool or something? Swimming burns more calories than running and its much easier on your body

I know whenever I have to stop exercising it throws me down a rabbit hole of binging/fasting and self hatred, but even just a couple low impact laps a week might be enough to quieten those thoughts down

 "
874, or even just an electrolyte drink if food is too much right now 
875," dude same

I only hang out with the year 12s since my years shit, but theyre going to graduate soon and Im forcing myself to make an effort so my year 12 doesnt suck ass

I wore a body con dress to a party the other night and everyone kept gushing over how small I am, shit like omg you turned side ways and you disappeared teehee. People who have excluded me so hard to the point where I had to leave the entire fucking year group suddenly want to talk to me and all the guys who would brush me off as gross and invisible suddenly want to dance with me

Dont get me wrong I love the attention but jesus fucking christ why are people so obnoxiously superficial "
876," you could also say youre tracking protein, you still have to weigh all of your food for that since it works like calories (does that make sense?) but its socially acceptable 

source: threw out my food scale in a pseudo recovery moment and didnt realise that now i cant track how much GAINZ im getting "
877, its kanyes work out plan bb lmao 
878, wait like one of the ones where you have to slide numbers across on a bar? wack 
879," I know Im making a lot of assumptions here, but she sounds like a shit friend

No matter how high your BF% or how short you are, if you are significantly underweight, you will not look right in the middle of a healthy weight

Please keep trying to recover, dont let her get to you. Try and surround yourself with people that support and love you, because those people are out there, and because thats what you deserve. "

882," https://www.coca-colajourney.com.au/brands/coca-cola/coke-no-sugar#ath

im assuming youre from the US where they can legally round down calories, if you ever see a 0 calorie food try and see if you can find the nutritional information for that same product from an australian website, its very strict here "
883," the day I start counting tomatoes is the day I check myself into impatient lol

they bring me too much joy to have calories  "
884," its not all great, theres always 3+ random slices of free cake in the break room sitting there taunting you lol "
885," shes 17 and going through her edgy phase in front of millions, cut her some slack jeez "
886, same with having a huge butt  
887," periods are **wack** for the first couple years, its probably just your body sorting out hormones, if you experience any other signs of malnutrition though then you should probably start looking more into it "
888," I work at a laser tag place and when theres 2 birthday parties on at the same time, only one host has to go upstairs and referee, everyone hates doing it because its just walking laps so Im everyones favourite person when Im restricting because Ill volunteer every time lol

I did like 15k steps in a 4 hour shift this morning "
889, because its their ticket out 
890," if i wanted to eat wanted that tastes like chocolate, i would eat chocolate. No one eats chocolate ice cream because of the chocolate authenticity, its because its unique and delicious and absorbs your feelings better than any other flavour "
891," if youre a strong swimmer and at a patrolled beach, go for it!  "
892," This probably isnt the best way to go about it, but you could watch what i eat in a day videos from female fitness youtubers (even if they work out more/are taller than you it doesnt really matter since youre growing) and try to base your diet around having similar proportions/macros to them "
893, easy there buddy youre beginning to sound an awful lot like jigsaw there 
894," worms? in *my* vagina?

its more likely than you think "
895, hence the still

902," same with australia, like there 0.8cals in my diet soda im drinking rn "
903," to be fair, your text was information only, you didnt ask him a question and you didnt express any feelings, that combined with the fact that dudes suck at replying to texts, makes me feel like his response wasnt malicious or cold hearted, hes just a guy "

905," I have god awful indigestion and reflux and that areas where I feel it, I dont really have much to offer in ways of feeling better but itll definitely be gone when you wake up "
906," I dont really have any resources for you, but the fact that youre self aware enough to catch it so quickly is admirable, if I were you, I would try and find a browser extension that will let you block yourself from looking at any website/keywords that talk about weight loss/eating disorders, then unfollow any instagram/social media accounts that are not people you know personally, and tap see fewer posts like this for any non-memes/landscapes on the explore page. I reckon you should doctor and try to push forward the appointment, and if you cant, call your GP and talk to them.

I really help everything works out for you, good luck with your transition by the way man! "
907, Think about how even more fucked up your teeth/skin/health would be if you kept purging 
908," the pain is you growing abs

thats probably definitely how protein works, yeah? yeah "
909," I went to purge in the sink the other night in the dark, and I didnt see that there was a cockroach right under my mouth until it was too late, now there is a vomit covered cockroach in my home somewhere

and like, I was disgusted, but I feel like I should be more disgusted "
910," could you go vegetarian/vegan? I used to be the same, it was so hard to say no to food, but since publicly going vego its like a switch in my brain and its easy now since I dont want to be called out for not really being vegetarian

It also helps in that I can have complete control over what I have for dinner, since its different from everyone else

If your mum loves to cook though this may backfire and she might start cooking with you in mind, and in that case you **can not** say no ya feel? "

915," sure, but that is extremely unlikely, you shouldnt be swimming anywhere without lifeguards  "
916," as far as we know, drinking lemon water doesnt have any more effect on your BMR than just drinking plain water, but since water *does* have an effect on your BMR, the 4ish calories from the lemon are negligible

In 14 participants, drinking 16.9 ounces (0.5 liters) of water increased their metabolic rate by 30% for 3040 minutes [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14671205) 

In 21 overweight children, drinking 0.3 ounces of water per 2.2 pounds of body weight (10 ml/kg) increased their metabolic rate b by 25% for 40 minutes [source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21750519)  "
917, Its so good to hear your getting help  happy birthday to your daughter for next month! 
918," Not sure about the health issues, but I drink a bit over a gallon of water a day and Im alive \_()_/

fr though just keep a full drink bottle on hand and drink as much water as your body tells you too. Its not like food, you cant really have fucked up thirst queues. Have some sports drink if youre really worried about electrolytes "
919," that would have been such a traumatic experience, I hope youre holding up ok "
920," I agree with space whale, but of you dont get answers here, you will most likely just ask other fitness forums and get the same information without the context of an ED, with could potentially be incredibly damaging to your health.

Lap swimming burns more calories than running as it engages your entire body, but it is very low impact and therefore ideal for people suffering with an eating disorder. Please take care of yourself, try to help yourself get to a place where you can ask for help. "
921," yeah pretty close, only like a 13 hour flight

worth it for dumplings "
922," frozen dumplings, the vegetarian ones are like 40 cals each so 200 cals looks like a normal dinner "
923," it was be insanely unethical for your doctor to so something like that, so I really doubt it, especially since seroquel is a pretty common medication "
924, f or c? 
925, thats so sweet oh my god  
926," what qualifies as a binge is very dependent on the individual, some people refer to eating more than their allotted calories is a binge, whereas to others the amount of calories doesnt matter, its all about feeing like you have no control over what your eating 

but if you want a concrete definition, the DSM5 defines binge eating (in the context of BED) as: 

- Eating, in a discrete period of time (e.g. within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances.

- A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (e.g. a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating).

The binge eating episodes are associated with three or more of the following:

- eating much more rapidly than normal

- eating until feeling uncomfortably full

- eating large amounts of food when not feeling physically hungry

- eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating

- feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed or very guilty afterward "
927," its not your fault, the imperial system is trash #metricgang  "
928," with the purging, does it hurt when you do it or is it just like reverse swallowing (like no stomach acids in there)? because I developed that and got it checked out, and while I didnt take the meds all the specialists I saw said it wasnt all that damaging to my body, if thats comforting  "
929," im not sure what your hair is like, but as a general rule its a good idea to towel dry quickly (just to get the wetness out) then brush it, then air dry

most of the time peoples hair looks frizzy because they brushed it dry, so maybe this might help :) "
930, normally im only really into femme girls but not today holy shit you made me gayer 
931," exercise (especially cardio) causes water retention, chances are you lost those 2lbs weeks ago but its only showing up now

theres also a chance that maybe youre overestimating the amount your burning since its super hard to calculate accurately "
932, do you have a link or name or something? its really cute lol 
933," I use them to feel empty, I know theres no impact on calorie absorption but its comforting to know that my weight on the scale is as accurate as I can get it, and that Im not bloated "
934," my vyvanse pills are white and blue, when I need to sneak caps in somewhere put a dot on the blue side in blue sharpie, you can only see it if you look for it  "
935, i appreciate her sacrifice  
936, how is the book different? 
937," teen here, its not that we *cant* read analogue, its that theyre so rare to come by that its not second nature like it is to older people, we just have to think about it for a second  "
938," I meant more like coverage in media outside of trans and gaming circles, the only mainstream source I can find with a story on it is the guardian "
939," I havent watched the entire thing since I was like 12 (I just watch my favourites here and there) so I forget most of the episodes, but after reading more into the director Im not surprised, thats really disappointing

I also had no idea about the DK64 thing, I only really started watching breadtube pretty recently (besides contrapoints) so I missed it, but holy shit $340k is incredible, I wish there had been more coverage of it "
940,"  for real? I had no idea, thats awful 

at least now I guess I dont feel so bad about pirating it  "
941," hey now the IT crowd has a laugh track and its television gold

edit: scratch that, fuck graham linehan "
942, mmm think of all that new mouthfeel 
943, same! I started vyvanse about 5 weeks ago and I still cant shut up about how much I love it 
944," its *much* more formal, but Conversations by ABC radio (australia) is like Getting Curious' polite reserved father "
945," it really wasnt flattering on the camo lady in season 3, but it seems to be a pretty safe bet for the guys "
946," all good :) reddit can take a while to get used to at first, I definitely suggest checking out the side bar/rules though, a lot of subs dont have much info there but some (like this one) do and its super helpful  "
947," unfortunately not, but this sub allows for one repost a day per user, so tomorrow you can repost this with the relevant demographic tag if you want more responses, you just have to add (repost) to your title as well "
948," the tag is whats you put in the title in brackets, it can be whatever you want, I would suggest (Those who have experienced breakups)

also, Im not sure what your going to use the data for, so this might not be relevant, but the last question in your survey seems to be assuming that all respondents are heterosexual, in which case, you should tag as (heterosexual, has experienced a breakup) "
949, normally surveys on this topic are rubbish but this was actually pretty good 
950," the title of the survey is literally Job satisfaction survey (Eclips Pictures only)

and yet, you tagged this as everyone... "
951, this is tagged as everyone but people who have not experienced a break up are excluded 
952, you tagged this as anyone but the first question excludes people who dont play video games... 
953," this survey is clearly for people who are currently using formula, it shouldnt be tagged as everyone... "
954, theres a middle ground between using your printer ever day and never using it at all... 
955," thanks for replying :) Ill mention it on the group chat, I totally forgot we had one ahahah "
956," https://twitter.com/tomjack20176306/status/1011030164996804609?s=21

not really sure whats going on though  "
957," Thanks for answering, I feel like I should probably clarify though, while its always around Tuesdayish, the time the shifts come out is pretty unpredictable, the only reason I see them first is because Im always holding my phone lol "
958," thanks for responding :) and yeah its really is, I legitimately look forward to my shifts ahaha "
959," Im a woman, so this probably isnt as insightful as a dudes opinion sick idk whats going on in your heads, but I feel like the majority of the time its not to pick up girls, its to feel powerful "
960," I was actually cat called a *lot* more at 11-13 than I am now (16 but look 18) the people doing it are normally 20somthing men, its disgusting "
961," very few women are as cautious as the person youre responding to, but most definitely feel similarly to an extent

all you have to do is make sure the person you are flirting with feels like they can reject you at any time with no consequences, that sounds a little harsh but I just mean that there has to be something external going on that can serve as a life boat to the other person if they feel unsafe (because its entirely possible that while you may have completely innocent intentions, they misread your body language or have had personal issues that make them more likely to be highly cautious of men) so this can be as simple as asking them out in a busy public space, giving them your number (not asking for theirs), the friend thing a person above suggested, and heaps more but im sure you get the idea "
962," I applied for a retail job through a similar process to this, I made it through the first round and into a group interview, every person there looked exactly the same it was honestly freaky, all conventionally attractive, white, 16-22 year old girls, my city is very diverse so this was very noticeable "
963," this one time i was in hospital for a week and they had me hooked up to something so i didnt have to drink any water, and holy shit it was SO WEIRD going back to normal, idk how I didnt drown from all the choking "
964, they just shy 
965," and while it sucks the dress is ruined, chances are it was like $5 from boohoo or something, so shes already got her moneys worth "
966," look at his facebook

its legitimately despicable  "
967, ima have to get me some vitamins 
968, the higher cal estimates on MPF are most likely including rice 
969," oh yeah its crazy in the states, I just straight up cant shop on US sites

asian stores definitely do have a much better range of sizes but unfortunately i havent been able to find any that stock clothes i like ahahaha "
970," there is one but it can kill you, i forget the name though "
971," vodka is the lowest cal alcohol, so i just have that with diet sprite bc im too broke to buy no sugar double blacks lol "
972, ^(i dont get it can someone pls explain) 
973, you tagged this as (Women ages 18-40) but women who have not had PIV intercourse and women who live outside of the US are not eligible to take the survey... 
974," sure is, one of my favourites "
975, i think you might like watching episode 6 season 4 of bojack horseman 
976,"  I had mine removed pre-ed! Thats why I was panicking

my dumb fasting brain panicked for a sec there thinking you were gonna say it could have grown back "
977," would you be able to work out more to make some room? the reason people say not to go below 1200 is that it makes it harder to get the right nutrition, so even if you net the same calories, working out and eating more is better for you "
978," I skip my periods with birth control, its kinda hard to answer the questions "
979," me, a feminist: 

me, a lesbian: mmm,,, sexy danger lady "
980," i was diagnosed with adhd and prescribed vyvanse a month ago and since then ive dropped from a bmi of !20.5 to 18.7! and the best/pettiest part is that i can use the ""omg these meds are insane i miss my real body i need to gain :("" line on everyone who gets suspicious "
981," i used to weigh myself every day but ive gotten better about it, now its 1/2 times a week  "
982," I work with a dylan and hes the most gorgeous man ive ever seen, and his girlfriend is the most gorgeous woman i've ever seen, and theyre both so lovely and their relationship is perfect and its honestly so rude of them so i agree "
983, (sister\*) 
984," me:

my body dysmorphia: you look like this "
985, wow i wish i was as cool and unique as you are 
986," also; justcico tells you your ""new bmi"" on the ""updated"" system, which, as a short girl, is kinda extremely distressing to see, so keep that in mind if you think it might freak you out "
987," [justcico.com](https://justcico.com) and [losertown.org](https://losertown.com)

it kinda works the other way around, but it just takes a couple minutes of plugging in different amounts until you get what you want "
988," A lot of professionals believe that dreams are just how your brain processes information, that they're completely random and absolutely meaningless, no one knows for sure, but thats just another perspective "
989," \ What sport do you participate in?

 #x200B;

I fit multiple of the categories, but its only letting me pick one "
990," it doesnt look mealted, its like a solid slab of cheese "
991," thanks for the info :)

Itd be fine if I did 4 years though?  "
992, a m e n 
993," I love these, I was pretty meh about the first release but now Im feeling pretty hyped about the album again "
994," ""dont suicide dog would be sad""

 #x200B;

alternatively, if you do not have a dog;

 #x200B;

""dont suicide future dog would be sad that it didnt get to meet you"" "
995," how does

bashing cishet guys isnt a huge deal

lead you to

If you find one of the most supportive subs on reddit personally attacking, I suggest you re-evaluate yourself.

 #x200B; "
996," Sexuality refers to who you are attracted to, not to who you have sex with

 #x200B;

you could chose to have sex with the most repulsive person you have ever met in your life without being attracted to them "
997," It shouldn't matter, but it does to a lot of people "
998," sorry assuming you identify as straight, but;

how would you feel if someone told you that from now on you could only date and have sex with people of the same gender (and you could not chose to stay celibate or single)? "
999," or you can live in constant fear and be miserable your whole life.

unfortunately, it's sometimes an 'and', as well as an 'or' "
1000," Also, if you answered yes to that question, you are probably bisexual or maybe even gay.  "
1001," i literally said that men *arent* a marginalised identity

to be honest i really dont give that much of a shit, i was just giving my opinion and backing up the person a couple comments above me. i just think people should be less dick-like to eachother "
1002,  
1003," I already commented this but a lot of people seemed to appreciate the reminder 

you need to eat 3500 calories in addition to your TDEE to gain a pound of real weight (not food/water weight)

so if your TDEE is 1500, you need to eat 5 entire dominos value range brucetta pizzas in order to gain one single pound of fat.

if you have to eat more than youd like over the holidays, its ok, youll bounce back. Just stay away from the scale for a couple of days while your body settles

you will be ok x "
