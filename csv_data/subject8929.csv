Anyway, in the video, the guy simply has a white sheet over his head, and he walks in his garden in front of his night cam. That's basically the video. I think he thought it looked real enough for people to believe there was a ghost in his garden, when in fact the video is hilarious and looks obviously fake. It would really make my day if I could see this video again. Thanks in advance. "

Le monde avait t balay par la Rvolution Bohme et j'avais voyag depuis Londres afin d'y participer. Sur une colline non loin de Paris, il y avait le village de Montmartres. Ce n'tait pas ce que mon pre avait dit -un village peccamineux- mais le centre du monde Bohme. Musiciens, peintres, crivains. On les connaissait sous le nom des ""Enfants de la Rvolution"". Oui, j'en tais arriv  vivre sans le sous. J'en tais arriv  crire sur la vrit, la beaut, la libert et ce en quoi je croyais le plus, l'amour.

259," ""Technically, I think it's immoral not to kill him."" "
260," I thought it would be a ""so bad it's good"" movie, but no, it was more of a bad movie. Except for the CGI. The CGI seems to have been made by a three-year-old, the characters are not interesting, the plot is full of incoherences (for instance, at the beginning, there's a girl saying she would never, ever use a gun, because she doesn't know how to use one... But who do we see a couple minutes later, using a gun almost PERFECTLY? The same girl).

It was the last day, so she allowed the pupils in the class to talk together and play. She read the letter. Later, when it was time to say goodbye forever, and as I was about to leave the class for the very last time, she put her hand on my shoulder and told me:

""You're gonna go far...""

280," The year was 2011, if I remember well. At the time, I was 11. I had known a guy for a couple years, and ever since we'd met, I'd fallen in love with him. On the last day of school, as we were together sitting on the lawn, I decided I would tell him about my love for him. I said: ""Loc, I love someone..."" I was FINALLY ready to tell him. He stayed silent for ten seconds or so, and asked: ""Really? Who?"" And the only thing I said was: ""No... I mean, you probably don't know him..."" I still regret it to this day. I keep wondering what my life would've been if I'd told him ""I love you"", instead of telling him a lie because I was a shy coward. I know he probably would've said he wasn't interested or something, but dammit, I should've tried. I missed my opportunity to tell him I loved him, and the opportunity to live a cute love story. And, most importantly, the opportunity to have another life. I was only 11, so I didn't know much about love, but still. I made a promise to myself: if I'm ever in this situation ever again, I won't try to hide my feelings. One regret is enough. "

 #x200B;

There was kind some sort of wake with dead people in furry suits. One of them was on an hospital bed, and the other ones were on chairs (and one was still alive). There was a stage and a door. Behind the door, there were people I didn't know (except my mother and the actor Michael Keaton. I saw interview of him lately, that might be why he was in my dream). A young woman told me she was a ""leaver"" and asked me to ""help her"" (I assumed it was about the wake). This girl looked very sad. I felt like crying. The first thing I thought was that this girl was about to kill herself. The woman said I probably wouldn't help, but I said : ""Well, I must pay tribute to them, so..."" After that, I went back to the other room (the one with dead people in it) and the stage was smaller and I thought I was about to fall. So I decided to go back to the other room, where there also was a stage. Now, chairs were in circle on it, and everybody was sitting, not saying anything. I couldn't see the other people's faces, as if it wasn't important. The only people I could clearly see were my mother and the unknown girl, whom I had never seen before in my life. As I was about to join the group, I woke up. When I woke up, I felt the urge to cry. I don't even know why.

But if I had to choose only one dream to fulfil, it would be this one :  I want my name on the cover of a book, and nobody will be able to achieve this dream for me, but me, myself and I. I want my name and my writing to outlive me.

471," Hello. A couple years ago, I read about a movie that had been made based on a story written by Stephen King (might have been a whole book, but I doubt it). A few weeks ago, I remembered the said movie and wanted to see it. But I don't know the title and when I search on Wikipdia, nothing shows up. 
The movie is about a man who drinks a rotten beer and is turned into a monster (I saw a trailer once, a long time ago, and if I remember well, the monstre looked like a viscous fly of some sort, but I'm not sure). Now, I know Stephen King has sometimes used the pen name Richard Bachman, but searching for this name online wasn't helpful. I really want to see this movie. Does anybody know what movie I'm talking about? "

484," This didn't really happen to me, but to my family, while we were on a vacation (but I nearly got scammed too). It happened in Camargue. We were visiting and suddenly we realized our grandmother was ""missing"". We turned around and saw her with an old woman (a ""Gitane""). As we were trying to reach for my Grandma, several Gitanes arrived and took us to the doors of the Cathedral. I was 14 or 15 at the time, and I was terrified. The woman took a needle out and told me she was going to perform fortune-telling. She said she needed a banknote to do it. I gave her a banknote. I couldn't escape her, because she was preventing me to do so with her arms. She began to tell me Barnum-like things (""Some days you feel sad, some days you feel great"" or this kind of bullsh\*t). After the ""fortune-telling"", she told me she had the right to keep the banknote, for she had predicted my future and my past (she hadn't). Suddenly, my father arrived behind her and told me: ""If you don't want to give it to her, do not give it to her"". The Gitane, surprised, gave him a dark gaze and gave me my banknote back (probably because she didn't want my father to punch her in the face) but not before whispering ""Your life is gonna suck and you'll never achieve anything"" into my ear. So, I wasn't the most ""scammed"" person of the family. My mother, aunt, and grandmother, have all been raised with the thought that Gitanes were witches that could bring unhappiness and sadness in your life by performing some kind of witchcraft. They all ended up giving about 65 Euros EACH, which is a lot. One of the worst things concerning this scam is that, in order for people not to go and tell the police, these Gitanes avoid being seen through security cameras, and bring people to the doors of the Cathedral, because it's the only way for them to avoid cameras. Please, be careful if you visit Camargue one day, mainly if you visit this place. You might lose a lot of money (these women are truly vicious and could do anything to get what they want). "

La pluie cr des flots mouvants dans les gouts.

Et j'adore la pluie. "

If you want to collaborate with me, to write lyrics for instance (in english or in french, or even in spanish, who knows?), as long as there's my name or username appearing, I can help you/collaborate with you.

My dream is to write a book. I don't lack ideas, no, but there's something preventing me from writing a whole novel. I don't want to waste my  life searching the ""better idea"", like I do everytime, because I know I  probably came across it once, and just decided to abandon it. By ""better  idea"", I mean a story I would've written easily and would've carried in  my heart. Any opinion and advice?

748," I have not seen any torture scene. But I might watch some to get inspired. And yes, choosing the right actor is important, but the only actor available I chose makes comedic contents online. I don't know if it will do. Yes, I'll try to fill in the blanks with sound effects and so on. Thanks.  "
749," Alright, thanks for your help "
750, Why not.  
751," Hi,

I'm currently writing a four-episode series. In episode 2, there will be scene in which a torture occurs. I don't want to show everything, I want the audience to ""imagine"" what happens, from time to time. I don't know how to make this torture scene sound and look awfully painful. I'm not very experienced for it's only my second short. If anyone could help a little, it would mean a lot to me. Thanks in advance. "

Des ampoules sur un gteau d'anniversaire. 

La diffrence que cela ferait! 

Branchez-les et faites un voeu;

Puis dtendez-vous et allumez! (?)

Ni de salissures de cire

Pour embter les invits.

Mais Grand-Pre dit: ""Ce n'est pas pareil! 

O est la magie?

O est la flamme?

Pour que tes vux se ralisent

Il faut souffler des bougies!""

790," I dunno if it counts as a mystery book, but maybe you should read Filth, by Irvine Welsh. It's a good book, I think. It's about a policeman who tries to solve a murder. I can't really say what it's about, for I would give out all of the story. It has suspense in it, though. A movie was made after the novel. It's a good film too. "

799," Hi everyone, 

Yesterday, as I was on the Lost Media Wiki website, I read something that reminded me of something I had seen when I was a little girl. I live in France, by the way. And the movie I'm talking about was made in France. It was a Christmas Special. I'm sure I saw it, but it's barely possible, for it was only seen once on TV, in 1997, and I was born in 2000. When I asked my mother about the movie, she told me it reminded her of something too. It was about Santa Claus being sad, and the Looney Tunes had to cheer him up. Here's the link to the Lost Media Wiki page:  [https://lostmediawiki.com/Op%C3%A9ration\_Bugs\_Bunny\_(lost\_French\_live-action/animated\_Christmas\_TV\_special;\_1997)](https://lostmediawiki.com/Op%C3%A9ration_Bugs_Bunny_(lost_French_live-action/animated_Christmas_TV_special;_1997)) 

I searched on the Internet, but I didn't find any other information about the movie. There's an [Allocin.com](https://Allocin.com) page about it, but it only tells which actors played in it (Michel Galabru, Lio; Etc...). Only two screenshots are available. There's an article too, but it's in French (Here it is:  [https://www.liberation.fr/medias/1997/12/24/notre-selection-operation-bugs-bunny-france-2-20h45-special-noel-tf1-france-2-france-3-m6\_223110](https://www.liberation.fr/medias/1997/12/24/notre-selection-operation-bugs-bunny-france-2-20h45-special-noel-tf1-france-2-france-3-m6_223110)). It had a Roger Rabit's vibe to it. I might have never seen this movie, and maybe it was another live-action Bugs Bunny Christmas Special I saw when I was little, but when I described it to my mother, she said she remembered it a little bit, just like I did. I'd really like to see this movie again (or to see it for the first time, for I don't even know if I actually saw it at all). Can someone help me, please?... Unfortunately, it seems to be gone forever. Maybe I should send a letter to TF1? I don't know what to do.

I'm sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading it. Have a nice day!  "
