0, Hahaha this is awesome. But sadly very underrated 
1, Its time fellow gamers 
2, This is more like r/im70andthisisdeep 
3, The comments on this article are gold 
4," Thats probably a stock image

Also: ""i do not sprechen sie deutsch"" means: i do not do you speak german. Can confirm as a german "
5, No not really. Its more like a big glowing sign drawing the attention of everyone to her 
6, Don't do it! Go see a psychiatrist. im sure a psychiatrist can and will help you. Ending your life is never the right answer 
7, Good luck and get well soon! 
8, Stay strong! Im sorry i dont have much to say. It really will get better. Dont let yourself get consumed by sadness. Stay strong and the sadness will go away. It might take some time but if you stay strong you will be able to move on. You got this! You can do this! 
9," Im from Germany. To be honest i dont know how i got help. I lived in a Boardinghouse and because i wasnt doing anything (lay in bed literally all the time, wasnt paying attention in school ect) the teachers and the people at the Boardinghouse (i dont know the word for them. They arent teachers) noticed and basically made the opointment for me. 

If you live with your parents ""just"" ask them (i know its hard but its the best for you) if not i think you can just google the clostest one and just make an opointment. But you are probably going to wait for quite some time before you can actually visit him. It took about 4 months for me to get my opointment "
10, Id recommend going to a doctor. Ask him if they could take blood samples and check them. Maybe something comes up but im no professional 
11," Dont worry. Your friend definitely doesn't think of you as a burden. I was in a very similar situation. I told my best friend how i feel about everything and at first i was totally convinced that he hates me and thinks of me as ""the retardet kid who wants to kill him self but also shares a lot of self deprecating memes"" but later i realized that he really does care about me. 

This is just a theory but i think the reason some people feel like a burden to others after opening up to someone is because you feel better after that and you feel like you dont deserve to feel better ant the cost of someone else (even tho that cost is 0) and that you might change in the eye of that person (basically ""dropping the mask"") but thats just a theory "
12, You want to talk about this? Im here if you want. Just dont do anything reckless okay? 
13," Actually yeah. Some people get out of depression after as little as a few months and other as long as several years. 

Good for you for beating depression! "
14, Does it get better after eating breakfast? 
15, Yes and it was the right decision. Not long ago actually. I know it might be hard at first but it is the first and most important step to recovery. Be as honest as you can so he can properly diagnose you. I know you probably have heard this a thousand times already but it really will get better 
16, Congratulations!!! Thats awesome! Keep it up 
17, Same. You probably have depression. But what you should definitely do is see a psychiatrist. Get diagnosed so you can get the right help. Dont let your life get ruined by this shit. Dont be like me and drop out of school because you didnt have any motivation to learn for school. You can do this. Stay strong 
18, Yes please

36, I just woke up from a dream where i got the maths exam back and had only 3 points. I got hungry so i and 2 friends started cleaning all the windows in class because we wanted some good chese but suddenly the windows were a car and we suddenly werent in the classroom anymore. It was the type of transition that you dont even notice in the dream

I cant ask for attention if i have denied it to others "

170, Oh. So that means that adl suddenly isnt a bunch of smol pp people? They still called him a racist and have contributed to the deletion of some YouTube channels they didnt like. Maybe the blackmail thing isnt true but the adl can still eat a fat cock 
171, And that means it isnt true?

183," I love rocket league. But the toxic part of the community is the absolute WORST. it really annoys me every time someones toxic wins. That people like that get what they want. Im not going to pretend that I've never wrote ""what a save"" or ""nice shot"" when someone missed and i also know that toxicity isn't exclusive to rocket league. Still annoyed "
184, The entire pvp community suffered from this change. Many pvp server still run on 1.8 or have some kind of plugin that reverses the changes 
185, I think so too 
186, Nice 
187," I met my (now best friend) through rocket league. Its genuinely amazing. We know us almost 1 year now and have played about ~800 hours together. Just hit someone up who is around your rank and maybe you will meet your new best friend.

Also try some custom training maps and if you are on pc also try some workshop maps. Grind them for an hour every day for a week and be amazed at how your skills are improving. If you can play more than an hour just do it. The more time you spend the faster your skills will improve. 

There is nothing more rewarding than train something and have it help you in a game "
188," Basically you could say that i got carried by my friend. He has amazing ball controll but his defense isn't really good. My defense tho is pretty good. Im the defense and he is the offense. I know, i know. Thats not the best way to play rocket league. But we're both working on it with custom training and workshop maps. "
189, D3 here with almost no ball controll. I couldn't dribble if my life depended on it 
190,  
191," Dont worry. I got the joke and i had a smirk on my face. I personally like offense humor and me and my friends have made jokes about Hitler pretty often. As long as they're just jokes, its okay mein kamerad "
192," Same. Me and my german friends make jokes about Hitler pretty often. And as long as they're just jokes its okay in my opinion. Even if other people think that a joke was offensive or ""not a joke at all"" no one gets to decide or change other people's taste

Edit: ""not good"" to ""not a joke at all"" "
193," Edit: the ""7"" turned into a 1 for some reason and when i wanted to edit it, it just said 7 again "

204, Basically everything thats water with something mixed in it leaves some kind of residue

208, I kinda see it too 
209, Why tho? 
210," If the warranty doesn't cover that try to CAREFULLY dissasemble the laptop and cleaning it from the inside. (I know this doesn't sound good but) try cleaning the motherboard and dont be scared to use water. As long as you leave it to dry a few days it may start working again. Helped me with my and a friend's laptop when the same happened except they didn't work at all. After carefully cleaning it tho they works again. I washed them with water, soap and a toothbrush. Good luck (and i dont take responsibility if you do it wrong. Just a disclaimer) "
211, Oh yeah. I've heard of that. But i have already fixed it. I cut the infested part out and filled the hole with aluminum tape 
212, Is that some kind of brand? I live in germany so i dont think that's a thing here 
213, Yes. I ALMOST FORGOT: the only reason i even installed that screen was because a big ass spider species would lay it's eggs INSIDE MY FUCKING WINDOW. I even have a video where i flush the (at that point pretty much empty) nest out. 
214, That sucks even more. I would be genuently traumatized and would never eat a bagel ever again. Holy shit

280," It wont matter. Youtube will just delete many dislikes because we're ""just hating"" just like with the YouTube rewind. "
281," Haha yeah i feel you. My friend also sometimes starts to sing stupid songs to ""annoy"" me (never at ranked games tho). At the end we just end up laughing at how stupid the song sounds lmao "
282, I have it locked at 80 fps with v-sync off (v-sync causes slight inputlag because your pc has to wait for your monitor) i have it at 80 and not 60 to reduce srceen tearing 
283, Steam profile name doesn't check out 
284, Haha tbh it sounds kinda like fun. But i have to say that at some point it has to stop. Like i play with my best friend (i know him through rocket league and we meet regularly. He lives close which is awesome) and we try to improve with every match. We troll us each other sometimes but we both agreed to stay focused and to not be silly during any kind of ranked mach. Tho Sometimes (mostly when i mess something up in a funny way) we both burst out laughing. He isn't laughing at me. We're both laughing about that miss. He never is mad twords me and im never mad twords him. Even when we're both full tilt because we both know that we gave it our best. Im incredibly thankfull for having such a great friend. We're both aiming to become pros in Rocket League but we have a long way to go but i think that we can make it. We have been playing since October 2018 and worked our way up from gold 1 to me being D1 and him D2. Having friends like this is important if you want to play Rocket league with considerably less tilt. Also it helps with longer play sessions because you dont want to quit immediately. (Also try to change the settings so it only shows the team chat. Really helped a lot) 
285, The cak tsta god 
286, Haha thanks kind stranger for providing the link i was too lazy to provide XD 
287," Yeah. I would change them around Platinum. Lethamyr did a good video explaining all the settings. I recommend watching that. (Idk type: ""lethamyr camera settings"" or something like that) "
288," Yeah i totally get that. I noticed that i tilt way less and play way better if i play with a friend that's around my rank. It helps if you play with someone who doesn't judge you for every little mistake and celebrates every little play. Your confidence really affects your playstyle and having nice friends around you really helps. Try to find someone to play with. It makes a huge difference.

Tldr: find a good friend to play with who isnt toxic "
289, What the actual fuck im crying and shaking rn 
290, The key to keeping your composure during any game is to literally not care about your rank. Its amazing and turned me from the extreme x-box kid that rages and screams to a somewhat calm player. Of course sometimes i still get tilted but it really made a difference. I think fluump said to not care about your rank and it's an amazing advise. It takes some time to adjust tho. Its totally worth trying 
291, Im in D1 and would still be excited about a shot like this 
292, Try playing with the camera settings in general. Like increasing your fov to 110 and increasing your camera stiffness. Try something that fits you. (Stuff like increasing the fov / stiffnes are generally accepted as something everyone should do) 
293, But you broke rule #1. You may have won the game but at what cost? 
294, Maybe its because you broke rule #1? 
295, Ma best friend always gets mad when i do it lol

337, This is going down in history 
338, Mucus sounds disgusting 
339, How insane do you have to be to think that this is how you talk to someone 
340, That fake at the beginning tho 
341, What the actual fuck... THEY ACTUALLY FUCKING DID IT IM SO MAD RIGHT NOW. Holy shit 
342,  
343, Okay so apparently i had a stroke and thought that there was something wrong. How do i delete this 
344, Isn't youtube like a part of this huge 100 billion$ company? What was their name again? GOOGLE? 
345," Sir, Im going to need a link to your channel. It's not like i enjoy stuff like that. It's for a friend i swear "
346, That's what a man does 
347, Danke fr deine Tipps. Ich werde sie in Betracht ziehen. Einen schnen Tag noch (: 
348," Cool. Informatik klingt sehr interessant. Ich habe mir schon berlegt was in diese Richtung zu machen, war mir aber nicht sicher. Wie ist es denn so im Westen und warum wrdest du es keinem deutschen empfehlen? (Ich hoffe ich nerve nicht mit meinen fragen) "
349, I'll give it a shot 
350, Okay. Wollte nur mal berprfen. Wie ist es so in den usa? Hab mir mal berlegt ob ich nicht vielleicht auch dahin will. Ich bin neulich 18 geworden und hab noch keine Ahnung was ich mit meinem leben machen soll :) 
351, General Schmitz? Hattest du denn berhaupt schon mal ein Schnitzel?? Kommst du berhaupt aus Deutschland?! Oder tust du nur so? 
352, I would be too 
353, Im not stupid. Android of course

358, We should get an entire year AT LEAST 
359, Even tho i dont mean it i have to say that this pride month thing is going a bit too far for my taste... I mean like if gay people have an entire month then there should be many other groups of people that would get a month 
360, Of course i dont mean it. Lmao 
361, No i mean it 
362, Okay. This is epic! 
363, I have no words to describe the pain im feeling rn. My favorite childhood game... 
364,  
365, My rocket league friend keeps getting annoyed by me not breaking rule nr.1. i need help to make him understand that you CANT break rule nr.1 (also he keeps breaking it) 
366, I do every now and then. But i kinda miss the old times. When life was simple you know? 
367," Do some research. Its insane. Look at the youtube channel ""louis rossman"" he makes macbook repairs and occasionally talks about apple and their business moves. I never really knew before i found him as well. "
368, Its the company itself that is the problem. Remember the iPhone 4? And how you lost signal when you held it in your hands? Apple was like: you're holding your phone the wrong way. Stuff like that just makes me angry. I dont have a problem if you like their products. Imo theid design is nice (except the notch and no headphone jack) but i fucking hate apple as a company and especially how they treat their customers 
369, F 
370, Im just pissed off that apple does these things. They rip their customers off and they even defend apple. 
371, Im horribly trigger lmao 
372," Fanboys like you are the reason why apple knows its ok to rip you off (999 for a piece of literal metal) and you suck it up. Every god damn drop of smelly cum right out of apples dick. I dont dislike their products. I dislike how they dont give a fuck about their customers. How they think its ok to poorly design products and then insanely overprice it. It sickens me to see apple talk about how you ""use ur product wrong"" like wtf? How is it anyone's fault except apples that your 2000$ macbook breaks from normal usage. "
373," Minecraft introduced me to gaming. A friend showed me this game when it was in alpha but i forgot the name. A few years later a different friend showed me the same game and gave me the cracked version (1.3.x i dont know exactly and i have the full version now). It tought me to use wasd and the mouse. I remember shitting my pants every time i heard a zombie. To protect me i build 2 walls from Birchwood logs. Just 2 walls and i stood in the corner with my 20 fps on my old laptop. Damn im tearing up just from remembering. I love this game and i wouldn't be who i am if it wasn't for minecraft.

 Thank you notch 3 "
374, Nasa is a true gamer 
375, Wow... I was about to apologise for doubting you but i thought that there was something off so i double checked lmao 
376, Im pretty sure it is tho. That shake when you hit the goal kinda looks like camera shake... Are you trying to get away with faking this
