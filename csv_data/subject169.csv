0," Your title says everyone, but question 2 asks what state your from, exluding non-US citizens. Adjust your demographic. "
1," Hey, took the survey, just noticed a lil mistake on the question ""How would you like to change your fat intake, if at all?"" one of the options is ""I would not like to change my calorie intake"" which doesn't make much sense. "
2," Those two will be fun esp bushys, I'm guessing most bars will have an event for it just pick your favourite and check their facebook page, if your in school the uni bar is for sure having one. "
3, Yeah he's still a highly ranked free agent player who streams a lot and is moderately popular. Probably the biggest gamer streamer in SK afaik. 
4, It's not ready =/= It's not finished

6," And splyce/damwon, since neither can be in A or C "

8, Well it's a great time for me! Love to wake up early! But understandably difficult for any night owls it there.

10, Rush B 
11," https://xx.reddit.com/r/regina/comments/bb1fdw/free_stuff_on_birthdays_in_regina/

compilation that's not too old and still p useful

the best ones imo are the free meal at denny's, the free beer at malty, and the free poutine at coney "
12," Don't get mad at him for posting this and it getting on your feed, get mad at those that upvoted it, the mods that have cultured the sub to allow and support content like it, and yourself for still being subscribed to /r/pics "
13," I think it might be him actually, just an alt account he forgot to log out of. 

[Here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/513029128870428673/615037980700311589/unknown.png) the MayYourIguanaSmoke account just randomly and innocuously answers what pub he's talking about in the thread from /r/pics. And looking at the photo, I would say he's probably right, that looks like out front of Ohan's and that definitely looks like an SK liscence plate (or at least a Taylor Toyota liscence plate holder) on the car behind them. "
14, Brett Lauther and hitting nutty kicks then missing easy ones name a more iconic duo 
15," Regional gauntlets, then a small break "
16, Idk they did have soligo starting for them earlier in the year sooooo maybe not a no-brainer 
17, I think he just means this year 
18," \* in na

He's smurfed at worlds before which is when it *really* matters "
19, He looks fucking embarrassed lmao 
20," It has always been the ""Game 5"" song, not the reverse sweep song, idk where you got that idea this has always been the case "
21," Yeah everyone knew that, so it's not even an interesting bet, but idt anyone really knew for sure how that showmatch would go lmao both teams seemed to think they would lose "
22," Can Grabbz please do a team dramatic reading of this with the lines from the team members voiced as well, maybe even hire an animator to animate it (thought that'll take awhile). It'd be fucking legendary. "
23," Yeah well like I said I've seen other examples of the cold being a factor that seems to affect this and there's lots of other evidence of *general* competitive gaming being disproportionately popular in SK, but I think you're right that demographics also play a role in Saskatchewan, as I *think* we have a fairly high 20 population, as well as a very high aboriginal population, who in my wealth of experience are very into video gaming culture. It's also possible that a high average wage allows for this, though that might be confirmation bias as you could argue that you should expect lower wage places to see more gaming since gaming is cheaper than organized sports, but at the same time more expensive than going outside and playing catch. "
24," Yes I agree, I'm not arguing with you that there has been a change in culture.

But the topic article of this thread is among a HEAP of evidence showing that that change in culture has affected Saskatchewan far more than other places, and so there MUST be some other compounding factor that makes Saskatchewan more susceptible to the change in culture than other places.

You can argue that that factor isn't the weather, but you cannot argue that Saskatchewan is not disproportionately affected by this change in culture.

Noone is arguing with you that gaming and staying inside are trends on the rise, we're talking about why that seems to be hitting Saskatchewan harder than other places. Because that is the topic of the original article in this thread. "
25," You aren't wrong, but it seems you're missing the point of what we are saying. He's not justifying why video games in general are big right now, but why they might be bigger in Saskatchewan than other parts of Canada. Video games are certainly overall popular because it's easier and easier to stay inside and play but that phenomenon exists everywhere, and we're simply saying the added incentive of the cold might make kids in SK stay inside more than BC. "
26," I don't know why your being downvoted, I'm pretty involved in a lot of esports and it seems like cold countries, Canada included, are massively over-represented partially because of wealth, but partially because of just this. And the prairies seem to have way larger esports communities per-capita than the coasts, likely for the same reason. "
27," The ex is a p awesome fair too don't forget, there's a rodeo, fashion show, concerts, esports tournament and more that are mostly free with the price of admission if the carnival ain't your thing. "
28, Holy fuck Upset looked like he wanted to die 
29," Yeah lol a lot of people just hating on her because she's ""le evil titty streamer!!!"" that the internet loves to hate. "
30, Just Afreeca taking care of business vs the winless Jin Air basically nothing interesting to intake from that game just intelligent play. 
31, [removed] 
32," You can claim that, and maybe it's true in some or many cases, but in the aforementioned cases I've clearly listed out the facts that might lead to disagreement and you can't just ignore them and pretend I'm pulling my opinion out of thin air because I ""hate change"". "
33, You're the most close-minded person in this thread for crying because people are upset. Can you not accept that other people have differing opinions to yours based on other facts and logic? Being unable to accept that fact is the very definition of close-minded and its all you show by justifying every disagreement you see in this thread with calling people close-minded. 
34," That is perhaps the worst fucking possible example of people hating change just for change. That place is entirely unique, and a such a hilarious landmark of Weyburn to the point that many people I've met who have never been to Saskatchewan basically only knew that buffet, and maybe one or two other things, about our province. Call us fat or slovenly for wanting to keep the *single* KFC buffet in a *single* small city, but not close-minded, as there are plenty of valid reasons someone might want to keep that, and its not even a change that would affect most people, as most SK KFC consumers are perfectly happy with the regular KFC they use most often.

I don't even disagree with you on the fact Sask is more close-minded then other places, and there are certainly plenty of people here I would describe that way. But when you hold an opinion and then someone [disagrees with it](https://xx.reddit.com/r/regina/comments/c8src1/love_the_new_gainer/espgfaw/) and you [immediately call them close-minded](https://xx.reddit.com/r/regina/comments/c8src1/love_the_new_gainer/espgkfy/) as if a FUCKING COSTUME AESTHETIC isn't the most subjective disagreement on earth, yeah that's pretty contrarian behaviour. "
35, You aren't cool just because you're contrarian. There are plenty of normal open minded people in this province who hate the new costume. I for one can't tell the difference other than the awful new eyes and wish they'd fix those. 
36, Dark Dash must be the smartest Dash then 
37, If you're looking for a wing night there's wing night at Vic's tavern downtown on Mondays. Also the Broken Rack and The Owl but I'd recommend Vic's. 
38," Yo don't delete the post just click the ""Disable Inbox Replies"" button it'll fix your problem "

This is our FGC, buncha nice fellas, play any and all FGCs but def those two you mentioned, meetups every sunday night, sometimes bigger events saturdays too "
43," That, but I also have to imagine that it's partly to do with the fact that they are not the main language stream for the LCK "

48," I knew a guy who was on Jeopardy that only won ~~4 days~~ 3 days but made it to ToC (where he got 2nd lol), it's possible "
49, I went to game 4 stood in the nosebleeds where's my CBC article 
50, https://www.saskjobs.ca/ 
51, I heard it in an interview on CJME. 
52," The mayor has gone on record saying he ""doesn't believe in Zipper merging"" as it is ""un-canadian"" so don't expect this any time soon. "
53," I agree 7am feels to early, but I always thought it was weird they used to only start at 8 considering I know plenty of kids who have to go to school before and after programs before 8 and some high schools (which maybe don't need school zones yes but they do have them) have classes that start before 8. Unfortunately I think the concept of 7:30 might be too complex for regina drivers. "
54," London Drugs in the east end, they have an excellent tech department staff that will find you what you're looking for! "
55," BTW I know this thread is super old but I just wanted to let you know that everyone in here seems to have missed an important detail that I've been told by some long time residents of Regina which is that the reason for the loophole/strangely worded zoning bylaw that allowed them to build it is that the property was rezoned when a local bible college wanted to build a tall property there, the developer's bought the land and the zoning carried over to them.

58," OMG that's *so* hilarious, I *never* noticed that our city rhymes with VAGINA. OMG VAGINA that's so naughty haha that's so crazy and hilarious holy moly what a crazy world we live in ^^^/s "
59, I usually tail-gate for Rider games in a parking lot on Sask drive but thats private property owned by some buds o' mine so that's why we can. The city parking lots and parks are where the proposed tail gating would occur. 
60, That interpretation was exactly what they are trying to explain 
61," Look for hotels in Emerald Park, just outside the city, would be my bet. "
62," when you guys link games you should start the link at ""/r/leagueoflegends"" instead of starting from the https, this way if people use old.reddit the threads will open in old.reddit and if people use new reddit they'll open in that. The way you currently do it automatically re-directs to new reddit. "
63," Not prolly, but my two cents is that if the current trends continue I hope they look to incorporate the academy talent into the roster especially in summer, since I think that though they are fantastic, they are \*so\* new that they need a little bit of time to develop, and Kelsey will be able to do great work with them this split. "
64, This is a tweet of a screenshot of a reddit comment posted to reddit 
65," Its random, items you are holding have a chance to be dropped when you get hit in every smash game. Dragoon parts count as ""holding"" items even tho they are stored out of your hands. "
66, Imhip  gluttony  
67, I think they knew and it has nothing to do with seeding. Players are allowed to play in both their play just suffers and the TOs couldn't care less. 
68," TOs have been running both Top 64s at the same time for years. Mew2king and Wizzy have classically suffered from it, and you can totally play in both, I'm sure Plup will for instance, it's just hard.

The only real unfortunate thing is that they didn't announce it early. But idk when TF leffen thought they were running melee lmao fucking midnight??? "
69, Jabash won but [Shroomed didn't lose](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/513029128870428673/541365980178284577/unknown.png?width=311 height=117) 
70," Yes, because pro controllers and joycons use Bluetooth, you can press the sync button, and then open up Bluetooth connections on your phone (android only) and then sync to the controller. Now the controller is desynced from the console and you can then desync it from the phone on the phone's end and it will be disconnected from everything.

This is a great way to desync controllers because you can leave the setup and then desync them, but desyncing them from the setup side is totally okay as well.
 "
71," Super late on this but, Skyloft was 100% not picked due to jank. Almost all the top level players at glitch agreed to not include Skyloft in their stage striking and picking, because of the jank. Warioware and FD on the other hand are just super polarizing stages, that are usually banned against characters that favour them. "
72, Travis was talking about it last night on stream and said he was sick I think.

Asta 100% winrate in the LCS

79," People like to use all sorts of controllers! The Pro, Joycons and Gamecube controllers all work just fine for this game and offer the same level of control and latency. The only advantage the Gamecube controller offers is that if you go to local tournaments, it is the best to use because of the difficulties in connectivity of wireless controllers. "

237," O, if you have PM I'd honestly suggest playing on that. It's not just a mod to make brawl more competitive and skillful but actually just makes the game feel so much smoother, plus the roster is great. And it's a smash game any casual will likely not have played before, so it'll be new and interesting, and can often trigger an interest in the scene.

Then when it comes to playing with them it all comes down to their expectations, from what I can gauge it seems like they just wanna play. In which case you should just chillout and play FFAs with them, items on as you desire, time mode (because it's just BETTER for FFAs), teams on/off as you wish. If at any point they start to get antsy for a little competition, THEN you can maybe play some sort of tournament to see who's the best. "

241," Smashville is considered the most balanced stage in Smash 4 because the blast zones are relatively average compared with the rest of the legal stages. The moving platform slightly benefits characters for many reasons. The existence of the platform and its mobility benefits characters that can extend combos on platforms, characters with high mobility that can take advantage of movement on platforms, characters that can shark platforms easily and characters that benefit from a slower paced game. However the relative lack of platforms benefits character that have from strong stage control and characters that need to play a higher paced game where running to platforms hurts them. And none of these categories seem to receive too much benefit (except maybe the high mobility ones). It's the most picked stage for a reason, and I'm sure I'm missing plenty of them. "

449," I'm not arguing with the importance of the thread, I'm saying that stickying the thread does it no good. The distinction of stickying it is pretty much useless in this scenario because the thread would be even more visible if it weren't stickied, so why not use the sticky on other threads that are useful but won't automatically receive such visibility "
450," Why sticky a thread that's gonna be on top of the front page anyway? If anything it's annoying because like banner ads, my eyes have come to automatically ignore stickied posts. "

586, Yeah idk exactly what updating tourney tabler is going to look like but because the last time all that info was updated was a long time ago so it's well out of date for every game so it's definitely a problem we're aware of and will try to address.  
587," As for art, art of one character that isn't even in smash is an obvious no go, but if they are part of artwork that already contains multiple smash characters and is clearly smash related, that's good. "
588, Me too 
589, Getting smash fundamentals and handle over the controls in general is a very good way to prepare for Smash ultimate. As with every game people who have been playing the other games will certainly have an edge. The new game will feel different but starting playing now goes a long way. 
590, This ^ and i removed your post so you can fix and resubmit how you please 
591, That's not a coincidental smashball that's ART bro 
592," #State of the Sub - /r/smashbros Ultimate Edition
##\#1: [New Rules!](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/wiki/rules)

Our rules have been reworded, and changed a little bit. There's been a massive influx of users and this has certainly caused myself and other moderators to look over some of our rules and realize their current version is very dated, and quite lacking. I won't bore you further, here's a TL;DR of the actual *changes* and explanations:

-Removed the ""No tournament spoilers in the title rule"" because it's useless (this follows a similar decision from /r/leagueoflegends). If you don't want spoilers don't go on Reddit or filter out spoiler posts from your front page)  
-Added a rule explicitly banning posts about things that happen to vaguely look like the smash ball  
-Added a rule explicitly banning posts asking for non-smash characters to be added to smash because there are **SO MANY** of these posts, and to be honest, they aren't doing anything productive and most of them are reposts. They're perfect material for the daily discussion thread instead.  
-We *are* however adding guidelines for how we'd like tournament threads to be posted. Because there are 800000 matches at every tournament we can't do a tournament-thread-team thing like other competitive subs, but hopefully these formats will help everyone make nice beautiful posts. We are aware tourney-tabler is outdated and will definitely be working on getting that updated for Ultimate's release.  

But overall, again, the biggest change is just the wording and organisation. Consider reading them all [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/wiki/rules)

##\#2: New Flairs!

A few of our mods have been working very hard to get the smash ultimate flairs available for all of you guys, but unfortunately it's gonna require completely redoing our flair system which is gonna take awhile. So be on the look out for that new flairing system which I've heard is going to be better than ever!

---

##\#3: Smash Ultimate and our future

Alright listen up everybody. There's a big problem a lot of people seem to have with this sub right now that has always existed but is probably worse than ever. The problem is that there are two sorts of people who visit this sub, basically competitive and casual. The casual fans are larger in number, but they come and go. This divide is stronger and harder to deal with than almost any other video game because of quite a few reasons, and it makes the problem hard to solve. In the end we have to have rules that are stricter to both sides than other subs and that also makes a lot of people mad. We try to design our rules in order to balance the sub properly between these two communities and are constantly trying to improve on that balance, but both sides need to understand that there is another 50% of the community trying to use this sub as well.

In the past week, any competitive players (as I know by the constant DMs I get from my competitive friends) will see the sub as having gotten out of control in favour of the casuals. But I can tell you based on the number of hate messages /u/DosRogers has gotten that casuals instead feel that our sub is far too strict. 

Is there a solution to this divide? Well, people CONSTANTLY suggest to us a second more casual or more competitive sub. There *do* already exist more competitive focused subs for /r/ssbpm and /r/ssbm, and these subs are AMAZINGLY well run honestly. But people still continue to come here, because many people, especially tournament viewers, are fans of the entire franchise not just one game. As for starting a casual sub and making /r/smashbros super competitive oriented, this NEVER works. It's been tried in the past, and in theory sounds great! But the problem is that once the new game hype dies off, there is just NO content to be had on such a sub, so the sub becomes relatively inactive and then when new hype comes around again, people would rather go to the sub that actually has people on it. So if there's a solution to this, we haven't figured it out or heard it, but if you think there's a way to design the sub better around this divide. The one thing we're trying to do atm is revive the daily discussion thread a little bit, and direct a lot of traffic to there and maybe start back up some those good ol' other weekly discussion threads.

So **TL;DR**: The two communities need to learn to love each other until we find a solution that actually works, and we *are* open to suggestions, but not hopeful. The casuals need to learn to love the competitive people that keep the game/sub alive all year round, and competitive people need to understand new game hype and that for most people there is nothing more exciting to talk about than the new game.

---

All of that being said, now that a week of hype and CONSTANT posting has passed, we're going to move forward with these new rules and try to be more strict on many of the things we've previously been fine with. Please take this opportunity to give your feedback on the new rules, and tell us how you think we're doing implementing rules and dealing with the influx of users, and how'd you like to see us improve in the coming months towards the release of Ultimate "

772," Aww man when I was in school I don't think there's a moment I'll ever remember more than when we were playing Melee in a hotel room on a band trip and another school's band teacher who was chaperoning comes into the room, asks us what we're doing, grabs a controller and fucks us all with Falcon. Apparently he was ranked in our city at the time, and we were all Smash 4 noobs who just brought a Wii because it was easier than bringing the Wii U. There was also the time our Math sub came over to us after school and played 3ds friendlies with us and even came to a tournament later that month.

So s/o to you my man, it might seem silly or weird for you but this stuff is so awesome.

784," That's still not second person, that's third person. In the case of smash that refers to the camera POV, which can be only either be first or third person.

Second person is only really used to refer to a writing style where the author speaks through the reader's point of view. (first person writes through the speaker's pov, 3rd person some other party, godly or otherwise)

If you're talking about the ""writing"" or w/e of smash, then you can kinda make the argument every single game ever is ""written"" in second person because the reader is the one through which the lens of the story is told in some way, but also make the argument that the reader *becoming* the third party or the main character means that it is either first or third party respectively. But basically none of this really applies to video games correctly and should not be taken that way.

But the only way you could really say a game is in second person pov is if the game was based on an altered reality mirror or if you were attacking yourself. (???)

BTW I'm not an English expert in any way so I'm probably mis-explaining things and misinformed on others but yeah. "

837," It's probably a rule leftover from the FGC rulesets because I'm pretty sure in most games there you aren't allowed to switch characters until you lose, so the rule is essentially saying picking ""Random"" is picking the character ""Random"" and you may not stay the character that Random gave you but instead must stay ""Random"".

869," I too would rather listen to dudes with experience, but the opinions here get passed around regardless of who is spouting them, and so it's an issue I believe deserves addressing. From my own experience, even if a lot of members of my scene seldom post here, they read it, and they always make wisecracks at me about my seeing posts (my one smash friend literally saw me in the hallway today and asked me about it). And you are definitely right about the fact that sometimes actual evidence still gets buried on reddit, especially when it can form its mind quickly and it is way too hard for tippety top people to browse as frequently as a combination of every average redditor.

That being said I do think that even a little bit of regular use from more knowledgeable people can slowly help to change how that works. A combination of that and the ideas in reddit's head about respecting those top people's opinions, hopefully caused by seeing them more often, could lead to better discussions. It might not be true but it's my hope. "
870," I definitely think it's possible to get most relevant or important things without reading reddit through twitter, youtube and word of mouth, and if you just want to consume the majority of content passively, I would suggest you subscribe, look at your front page and don't read the comments.

But when you say ""reddit is an important source of community input"" that's really what I'm getting at with the initial post. If you value that input at all I think it's important that you do your best to improve the conversation. If instead you believe reddit's input is as bad as some people claim, I don't know why you read it in the first place. "
871, ^ which is what a majority of people do by default 
872," Lmao, imo end every post and comment you ever make like that (no /s) "
873," I meant mostly read on the daily, which I *imagine* many (certainly not all or even a majority) if not some players do. Sorry, a bit exaggeration "
874, Except NASA scientists don't read and talk about college rocket club facebook pages on the daily. 
875," Yes thank you GIMR, you are definitely an amazing user. I actually totally understand the idea of hating on reddit in general, I think it is fair to consider it an inferior platform, and even jab on it in general if you believe that way.

What i'm really getting at is that giving it attention on twitter if you hate it and creating animosity in the community just doesn't lead anywhere good. If you are someone who gets tilted by reddit super duper hard, try your very best to just avoid it. "
876," Yes, thank you for this reply. This is certainly the one big problem with reddit, is that being active to a post is more important than being credible. Obviously I want those credible sources to rise to the top, but ultimately that doesn't happen. I still think reddit is one of the best platforms for discussion though because flaws exist everywhere.

That being said I don't want to herald reddit as the be all and end-all of discussion, that's not the point of the post, it is certainly not perfect. The main point I have though is that if someone important is not using reddit because they believe it to be inherently flawed, I don't understand why they *are* using reddit. It is **of course** true that meme opinions and whatnot are more likely to rise to the top than a credible post, but if you dislike that, like I mention in the post, do your mental health a favour and stop reading. But continuing to read it and posting about it elsewhere is only a negative to the community. "
877," tl;dr at the bottom

**DISCLAIMER** (that you can skip): Let me open this by saying that IDGAF about bayonetta, I mostly stopped caring about Sm4sh a few months ago when school started and I *finally* gave up hope of ever having the one character I ever loved re-legalized. So I don't have a side in this debate, but I still follow shit on reddit/watch the big tournaments/talk with my smash friends on discord. That's not what this is about. Also, I'm a mod but this isn't a messsage from the mod team, just a personal issue I'm having as an active user, though I know I'm not the only one tired of this. Finally I use many examples or w/e from Sm4sh in this post, but it isn't exclusive to Sm4sh, that's just the most recent example of this bullshit.

---

**How did this post come about?**  
Now, I want to make this post because I think a lot of top player's views on this community are frankly backwards, misguided and unjust, and I want to make a post that explains my feelings on that attitude along with a proposition to those top players.

**Why is /r/smashbros important?**  
Well, like it or not /r/smashbros is one of very few sites that host the fairly large smash community. There's essentially Reddit (250k subs for this and many more for the PM and SSBM subs), local facebook groups (in my experience mostly used for announcing/planning things, less so for discussion with the rise of discord), local scene/character discords (not likely used as much by top players in my experience), smashboards(...), twitch (not an open discussion platform in the slightest unless you're doing a real ass discussion panel) and twitter. Twitter is certainly the one most similar to reddit and also the one used by most people, and used the most by top players/personalities. The point is, when you shit smashreddit, you are shitting a huge portion of the smash fanbase. And I wish instead you would work **with** us.

**But first to the average redditor** I also want to say to you redditors to not do the same shit. Don't take tweets and come on here to complain about them. Go on twitter. When one platform looks at another, pulls the arguments *they* want to discuss and then talk about those arguments amongst themselves, that isn't healthy, that just encourages more groupthink. I've seen some of you being awesome like /u/Big4Lil on that rushhoursmash stream, but posts like [these](https://xx.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7xa8ix/bayonetta_and_characters_as_functions/) or [even these kind of](https://xx.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7xa4q7/smash_twitter_in_a_nutshell/) piss me off.

**Well what could I do**
Well, in a perfect world we have discussion in real life in a great open lively debate every week at a smash bros town meeting. But that doesn't exist. I think it's clear I'd like you to stop with the shitting on us but I think the biggest thing you could do, is actually consider using this platform and let me tell you why in 3 simple reasons:

1) **Expand your brand**
Lots of you folks trynna make a living off smash? Grow your stream? Get sponsored? There are A LOT of jims over here at /r/smashbros that read this thing every fucking day. When hungrybox first started growing his brand he commented on here a lot, and still does but not as much, and in turn got a lot of supporters here and suddenly there were more hbox twitch clips on the frontpage than even mang0. It really does help just as much as if not more than twitter since you are continually making your existence known to everyone, not just your followers. And I don't mean just make an account and start posting your stream whenever it's up, that's not the best way, I mean start commenting like a regular ass user, which brings me to my second point...

2) **Tell us we're wrong**
This one's easily the most important. Have a problem with something someone says on reddit? Fucking reply. Don't tweet about it, because guess what? They probably don't see that if they're just ""some random reddit jim"". If you genuinely care about people being misinformed, genuinely want the community to change their mind or to continue to love the game, use your superior top player knowledge of the game and community to tell us why we may have misconceptions about it. If you think you're gonna get downvoted, trust me, you probably won't because people respect your opinon/are jims for you here. The Mr. R tweet calling out that anti-bayo post got hundreds of upvotes. Some commenters disagreed or w/e but people wanted to hear what you had to say. If you don't think it's important for the community to stay informed you're just wrong. If people see shit (or SAY shit) like ""bayonetta is broken fuck sm4sh"" on reddit and noone is there to tell them they might be wrong, they're gonna believe that, and maybe stop watching/playing sm4sh.

3) **We're *just* as bad as any other platform you already use**
Like I said earlier, reddit one of few platforms smashers use for discussion, but there isn't anything *incredibly* inherently wrong with it compared to others, except maybe the absence of top players calling out the bullshit, despite the fact they read it. If you don't want to use reddit because our opinions are bad or you might get flamed, well lemme tell you, I **READ** twitter, I see the toxicity and bad opinons there too (hell I **KNOW** people who are blocked by half the people to whom I'm directing this post). Reddit is no better, but no worse. You might get called a bad name or some shit, but you get called those on twitter too, and at least on reddit there are moderators to remove the absolutely awful shit. But if you can't get over the problems with reddit, the attention that it seems to give trolls, well, just give it a break then eh?

---

**TL;DR:**
/r/smashbros is a part of the smash community thats *probably* here to stay whether you like it or not because a lot of people like or already regularly use the platform. It's a decent and rare public platform for discussion that's main problems are either not exclusive to it or can be fixed, mostly by you. If you actually give a shit about changing people's minds about anything, about keeping your game's community alive and well, man up and make an account. Or, and this is perfectly reasonable as well, just stop reading reddit. Because if you really don't like what's going on here continuing to lurk isn't going to help your mental health. Other esports pros are often times blocked from reading their respective reddits for good reason lmao.

DM me on here, discord, facebook, twitter w/e if you have any questions about reddit, or wanna discuss/argue anything or clear something up. Or better yet, comment on this post. *Or* you could tweet/stream about how I don't understand your perspective on this and I will continue to not understand and instead resent you because I probably don't follow you on twitter/twitch.
 "
878," Could you have not just responded to that one single tweet saying ""ok but noone is saying ban salem that analogy doesn't work"" instead of making a big long reddit post complaining about this. God this shit where one platform looks at another and then complains about it on their own platform is exactly the problem here and why discussion isn't going anywhere, it just encourages more groupthink. "
879, @COLE YOU'RE SMASHREDDIT FAMOUS LMFAO I KNEW YOU'D MAKE IT SOMEDAY WITH YOUR JIM TWEETS KEEP IT UP BUDDY HOPE YOU SEE THIS WHEN YOU WAKE UP AND CHECK DISCORD LOOOL 
880," Play with lots of people, enter lots of brackets. Spend only as much time labbing as you do thinking about the game and how you can improve/watching your replays or better players vods. "
881," Accessibility, it takes a lot of time and effort to get every custom, and a ton of setup for every tournament to get them ready. Combined with the fact many are definitely not balanced for competitive makes it enough to ban them. "
882," Between the population of people still playing on 3ds being tiny and the fact very few players in general go to play 4 fun and how much those players would be spread throughout the day plus the fact most anyone wanting to would get discouraged just like you, there just isn't anyone wanting to play.

896," Idk if l-cancelling is a good example here, iirc the original purpose of l-cancellins was so that if you wanted to shield immediately upon landing after a move it would be more fluid, we just cancel before shield comes out.

897," On Sunday there is only one stream meaning tons of viewers, and tons of outsiders viewing because Evo is very well known, but most people just tune in for sunday, and it's on a bigass stage with a bigass crowd. "
898," Other games offer a lot more money and opportunities to EVO than melee through their devs, even s4 in a sense. Also a lot of the hardcore FGC think
s very little of smash games and 2 out of 8 is a large share of the lineup. So with fewer games this year and big competition there was doubt in a lot of minds. Especially when it got pushed to saturday last year and the FGC pretends it's dieing "

922," That doesn't change anything, Ken Mkleo Choco and Aba are the only seeds that Smashgg shows for sure because of their predicted placements, after that there are a bunch of ties so we have to find seeds based on winners matches with the known seeds (ie 5th seed would play Aba etc). Freezie put all the right matches but has messed up the order of some of the ties later on. "
923," Wait... either something's wrong or I'm crazy. If MKleo is 2nd seed he should play the 31st seed, Shogun (according to you) in Winners 32, but he doesn't. Because when we reference seeding, that typically (and also does according to smashgg, the website these brackets are on) is defined by people's projected paths in winner's bracket, and has nothing to do with their loser's path. So I'm pretty sure a lot of this is wrong...

967, I like how Practical TAS' ballot which used the same ranking method as PGR also has S2J over chudat and yet people complain about what you just mentioned and people also complain that it's because of some sort of bias

969," The biggest reason most would prefer it is likely that it's wired, meaning a lack of latency and just overall less hassle. It's impossible to say what controller is arbitrarily the best, and so people use whatever they are comfortable with, but those two reasons plus the fact that it has been a constant controller for smash since melee are why it's the most popular. "
970," Super Smash Bros. Melee is the best game ever made in generations

I was going through a lot of stuff as an engineer. My popoffs were small and I just didn't have any interest in doing stuff. I skipped work often and barely went to meetings. And not to mention this asshole named Plank who owned me some money and slept with my girlfriend. That son of a bitch.

So anyways I quit my job because I wasn't showing up most of the time and my boss just did not care. So I spent my days dwelling away on my stream in the deep cycles of for glory.

I would just go and play videogames by myself, being totally antisocial. I had a wii u and I often played Smash 4 and other games. However, none of these made me interested really. Then, one day that all changed.

I was bored so I was going through the coolrom directory when I come across this game called ""SUPER SMASH BROTHERS MELEE"" I never heard of the gamecube console before but the concept looked interesting to me. I decided to purchase the game and immideatly I was fuckign hooked/

The game is fucking amazing jigglypuff is so unique and different and theres so many different foxes its amazing. I never play friendlies most of the time against other people and this helps me improve my skills. WHAT AN AWESOME GAME.

It really helped with my mood and I decided that if I wanted to start going to tournaments for smash bros I would have to clean up my act and start going to work again. So now I make $$$ off smash and everything is amazing. "

973," Yeah it seems to try and compensate for not being able to take 20% CDR in runes anymore, making alot of kayles opt for lucidity boots. Basically this is telling us to take berserkers instead and nerfing the extra damage we would've gotten for not having to buy lucidity. Whether or not that'll be how it works out is yet to be decided. "
974, Kayle has had a [high winrate](https://www.leagueofgraphs.com/champions/stats/kayle) for a looooooooong time my friend. 
975," SSBMRank by MIOM, the rankings for 2017 are being released atm, they just released [51-60](https://www.redbull.com/us-en/ssbmrank-2017-60-51). [Here](http://liquipedia.net/smash/SSBMRank) is a full list thusfar for the released 2017 rankings as well as all past rankings. "
976," I don't know that a megathread is the right means of doing this, but putting them together in some place does sound like a good idea. I might look into making a page on the wiki for all the PRs posted here. "
977," The big problem with a megathread would be that all the PRs release at such different times, the megathread would have to be up practically all year (which definitely means no one would read it btw). Also these posts are practically all the exposure a majority of smash communities get so it's good to let them have that every so often. "
978," Ya seeing all the different local scenes own little piece of personality and also allowing all the local scenes to get a little bit of exposure is a big part of why they're a good thing that I don't see a reason to get rid of. 

For instance when we posted our local PR two people commented saying they didn't know we had a scene, but lived here and were gonna check out our locals, plus the artist got a ton of positive feedback that encouraged him to keep up the good work. "
979, Explain? Do you just not want them posted? I personally doubt that occurring cuz they're p cool. 
980,  
981," I understand why they did it for this generation though becasue 1. it was Smash 4 so the ""for"" just kinda worked and 2. The same game was on two consoles so the versions could be differentiated by, well their only difference, the console itself. However the two versions could be united by still being ""Smash 4"". "

984," The original post brought forth an issue directly affecting smash content creation, a vital part of the community.

This post simply brings forward a comment by the individual regarding the issue, making it barely tangentially related to smash. It only serves to further pile on the hate to this individual without actually addressing any important issue.

1023," i understood your criticism, it was just wrong

And that goes RIGHT back to my original critisism of you making positive statements without explaining yourself. Unless of course your explanation was ""nope that's not why"", in which case, that is not a response to my criticism, that's just repeating your point of view in the debate. I asked you to address my original criticisms that explain why your tone is highly condescending, and you answered by saying ""you wrong tho!"". 

my first comment did not contain ANY inflammatory language

I know all this. If it did contain that, it would be removed, I already said ""you not doing anything explicitly 'wrong'."" I am simply trying to argue with your point that people are downvoting you because of your name, and addressing that by my criticism. You can't just say ""people downvote me because of my name"" and be more right because you keep repeating it, especially after I pointed out examples that are clearly to the contrary. I've seen your comments before, I've seen them get heavily downvoted, and in my opinion it is because of the way you write which I very clearly previously explained. You even said yourself that you think it is because of the way you wrote in the *past*, which again in my opinion hasn't changed all that much. 

the fact of the matter is OTHER PEOPLE took it as arrogant or condescending.

OHHH So you admit your tone is the reason people downvote you, not your history. Now, you can say it's only ""other people"" taking it as arrogant and condescending, but when it's a consistent trend it prolly means the tone of your text *IS* arrogant and condescending. That is the point in tone in text afterall, to communicate to the people reading what your attitude is by your diction and syntax. "
1024," See here's your problem dude, I criticized you a lot in that comment, and instead of taking any criticism or talking about any of that, you took the two statements I made at the start as to why your comments aren't *especially* agregious or rule-breaking and talked about those. And you didn't even mention the fact that I even slightly questioned one of the things you said, you just took ""I mean you're right about everything"" with no context. I explain plenty why you got downvoted, which has nothing to do with you not doing anything explicitly ""wrong"".

Then you end by blaming people downvoting you, ""based on my previous tones and comments"" when I very clearly explain why you were getting downvoted for your **current** tones and comments. There is clearly not some massive vendetta against you man, your helpful and nicely written comments today ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7kbl6m/final_destination_and_battlefield_will_be_legal/drdok3h/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/7kbl6m/final_destination_and_battlefield_will_be_legal/drdrlkc/)) don't get downvoted, because they're good comments.

And why does it matter if it's just a friend? That has nothing to do with the point I'm trying to make, which is that the overall sentiment of that last statement shows your condescending attitude towards everyone else, and is likely the reason you got some downvotes. You could have been pinging fucking /u/MetaCavern69 and it would have had the same effect. "
1025," Umm, I mean you're right about everything (save maybe the Metal Cavern thing) and you aren't openly insulting people, but I'm guessing people downvote you/think you're an asshole because of the way you write. It sounds stupid but when you can make up your own inflection for people (as is true on the internet), it happens.

Like, your very first comment is very short and succinct, with no further explanation of any points you amke, and you write as if everything you say is the god given truth that cannot be questioned. ""FD would have been banned a long time ago"", here you make a factual statement instead of a normative one on something that is definitely an opinion and that prolly makes it seem like you are a know-it-all. Plus you don't even go into detail about why that statement might be true, which to most people would probably not be obvious.

Then ""there is no such stage as 'Meta Crystal,'"", instead of answering his query on this one you just point out a silly mistake without applying it to his comment at all, even though I'm sure you're aware what stage he meant. 

Then you end your comment by publicly pinging a well known 64 player, whilst also implying that you think the comment above yours is funny, most likely assumed to be because it's stupid/uninformed, when it was basically just some guy wondering/asking a question, not even making any outright statements you disagree with like ""modded FD should be legal"". Plus if you're gonna send a friend funny shit from dumbois on reddit like me who don't know anything about 64, do it through DMs, otherwise you're just asking for downvotes. "
1026, No I'd have to give that to trying to do lagless Mario/Luigi/whatever bairs at ledge for hours or spending hours learning to do like 1 crouching pp or stepdash at a time so I can look really cool in between stocks or when I'm warming up before my opponent gets there.

1064,  
1065,  
1066," Alright so now that the candidates are announced I just want everyone to know why I think ARMS deserves to be in Smash Summit 4:

1. ARMS is relatively new and has been on the comeup as of late. Really noone payed attention to ARMS until the last couple of weeks but already ARMS has made waves and qualified for voting. Just imagine what ARMS could do with the exposure from Summit

2. ARMS has a great personality and is quite known for their hilarious memes and wacky personality

3. ARMS has a playstyle like no others. HAVE YOU SEEN ARMS' GAMEPLAY FOOTAGE. They're crazy, wacky and yet still this successful, I wish we could see more unconventional play out there like this.

Pls vote now on [https://smash.gg/](https://www.generosity.com/fundraising/evo-2017-player-vote-arms) remember that just like last time you can buy your way to victory "
1067," Hype! Hopefully this shows their commitment to Smash 4 being run better than last year as well as a reconciliation for last year and acknowledgement that we're important as 2nd biggest game in terms of attendance

Melee isn't tho????????????????????
---

This does unfortunately mean that melee isn't, which is certainly a strange decision considering their viewership is higher than everything but SFV and they are a far more accepted game in the FGC but I guess we taking turns now? The fact that Blazblue and potentially ARMS will be on Sunday over Melee is kinda fucked

Also Joey was talking a lot about diversity in Top 8s and seemed really excited about that so that might be part of his reason "
1068," K I'm def done after this one jfc

1086, I was looking at VR experiences (specifically [this one](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/gear-vr/1125286047502859/) ) and was wondering if there is any way to use gear VR apps on Rift or Vive since I couldn't find any answer to this question online and was thinking of buying one but really want some of the gear apps.

E: Lol people complaining about these like wtf did you expect from 1 round of pools with 4 people making it out of each pool. Just because you don't know names doesn't mean its not an upset. Most of the talent at this tourney is local or relatively unknown (hazmatt was a first seed and he's #10 on the NE PR). Imagine your local #10 losing in first round of pools at a local monthly. "

I'm from Canada and can wait for prices to drop on things especially the 1070 or for sales. "
1094," I was wondering how to, if at all possible, one might go about removing floating text from a video like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt4z16n-3eU ab_channel=LittleHouse). I want to change a lot of the text for a gif and have no idea where to even start with changing it other than completely covering up the old text. Is there any way to do this in Ae? I'm still learning Ae but I'm pretty confident using it so far. "
1095," In melee people often talk about an [Armada number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number), because he's so good and rarely gets upset, which is how many tournament wins you are away from beating Armada. For instance n0ne beat M2K who beat Armada, so n0ne's Armada number is 2. Well since ZeRo has been at the top of Sm4sh for awhile now, and now that he's lost a few times so it's actually realistic, I thought it'd be fun to figure out your ZeRo number! I'll start. 

subject169ClieW4KELocusBigDM2KZeRo

So my ZeRo number is 6! Have fun! "

1158," In 20XX, professional Super Smash Brothers Melee player Mew2King announces his retirement from the ESPORT to follow his doubles partner Zeros career as a Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and 3DS player. However, it becomes evident that he is not as skilled in Super Smash Brothers for the Wii U and 3DS as he was in Super Smash Brothers Melee. M2K is assigned a publicist, the bumbling Zer0 to make his new career less bumpy. Elsewhere, in outer space, an intergalactic amusement park called VGCBootcamp faces dwindling popularity, so its owner, Mr. GIMR, sends his diminutive minions, the Nerdlucks, to capture the Low-Tier-Heroes as new entertainment. The Low-Tier-Heroes live in an animated world hidden in the centre of Battlefield, but are unable to listen to the Nerdlucks' threats and challenge them to a game of Super Smash Brothers Melee to try to win back their freedom.

However, the Nerdlucks steal the talents of Super Smash Brothers Melee players Mang0, PPMD, Leffen, Armada      and Hungrybox, leaving them incapable of playing. The Nerdlucks absorb the talent, transforming into the gigantic Monstars who easily intimidate the Low-Tier-Heroes. While playing Brawl with BobbyScar, TafoKints, and Zer0, M2K is sucked down a hole and is recruited by Axe to help the Heroes win against the Monstars. M2K agrees to help, but sends Axe and AMSA the Red Yoshi to his house to retrieve his Super Smash Brothers Melee gear. The two have a difficult time obtaining the controllers thanks to M2K's pocket fox, but his sponsors help them out.

Meanwhile, Zer0 has been digging out the ICs chaingrab to find M2K, but spots Axe and AMSA leap down another one and pursues them, reuniting with M2K in the Heroes' world and joins the Low-Tier-Heroes. Another new recruit is Kage The Warrior, a skilled Super Smash Brothers Melee player whom Axe falls in love with. The day of the match arrives, but the first half is dominated by the Monstars, leaving the Low-Tier-Heroes unconfident. Zer0 eavesdrops on a conversation between the Monstars and GIMR, learning of how they gained their talent and informs M2K. Axe and M2K convince the rest of the Low-Tier-Heroes to fight back, and the first half of the second round allows the characters to take the lead using Fox. GIMR decides he wants M2K as a new attraction, and makes an agreement with him that he will become said attraction if he loses the match, sparing the Low-Tier-Heroes.

To ensure his victory, GIMR has the Monstars play dirty and injure all of the Low-Tier-Heroes save M2K, Axe, AMSA, Kage, and Zer0. Zer0 becomes the fifth player and manages to take a stock, but is literally JV4ed by the Monstars and is removed to love nessa. The referee, Mr. Wizard, informs M2K unless the team gets a fifth player then the game is forfeit. BobbyScar appears and volunteers to be the team's fifth member. In the final seconds of the game, M2K counter picks FD and manages to use cartoon physics to extend his sword and take the last stock. Scar retires from the ESPORT, and the Monstars blast GIMR to the Moon in a rocket when they realize they don't have to take his abuse anymore. M2K convinces them to give up the stolen talents and they are welcomed to stay with the Low-Tier-Heroes.

M2K and a recovered Zer0 return to the surface, the Nerdlucks dropping them off at M2K's next TR4SH local. Later on, the two visit the incapacitated Super Smash Brothers Melee players and return their talent. The players invite M2K to a four person free-for-all match but when he declines, they question his loss of talent. In a move mirroring his actual comeback in 20GG, M2K returns to EVO to reprise his Super Smash Brothers Melee career.
