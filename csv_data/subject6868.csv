29," I am a cisgender female.
I think I might be autistic but have never recieved an official diagnosis (I've heard this matters in relation to sexuality sometimes).

I find both women and men aesthetically attractive.

I wouldn't mind having sex with a woman, but only if I was a cisgender man.

But I would like to be in a purely romantic relationship with a guy. Only if he is smaller than me, I want to be the one to protect him and take the stereotypically male 'dominant' role.
I would hate being in a relationship with a guy taller than me, I don't know why.

On the other hand I have never had a 'crush' on anyone and I have never wanted to be in a relationship/have sex with any specific person. 
Because of this I have labeled myself aro ace for the time being.

So I would love the idea of a romantic relationship, but the problem is I don't want to be in one with a specific person. 
I would only want to have sex if I had a man's body. But I am almost certainly not transgender, I still want to identify as female in real life.

I am probably just going to stick with calling myself aro ace. "

88," Year 11 here.

I am thinking of studying German, history, and biology at A level.

I consider these to be the subjects I am best at and also enjoy. Currently I have no idea what I want to do after A levels, so I am thinking of just doing the subjects I think I will get the best grades in.

I believe I am predicted an 8 in History and Biology and a 7 in German. These are only educated guesses based on the start of Year 10 (teachers haven't given us any predictions yet this year), so they may be higher.

I also feel like maths would be a good choice at A level, however I think it might be too hard. I did do GCSE further maths for a few months, but dropped out after constantly getting Us in practice tests and just not understanding anything. 
That class was intended as a 'stepping stone' to A level maths - if it is harder than GCSE further maths I don't stand a chance.

As far as I know all 3 of these subjects require a lot of work. In addition, I have only been studying GCSE German for about a year (however I have been taught a bit before that by my German family), so I don't know if the course will be too advanced. Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof!

Would people who study these subjects recommend them? I would like another opinion on my choices, as of now I am about 75% sure this is what I want to do. "

They are all so different to me, I find it hard to talk to them. They make fun of me for my hobbies and interests - although they mean it as a joke, it still makes me feel bad. When I try and join the conversation I am always ignored or dismissed as irrelevant.

Also, they do stupid things like pronounce my surname wrong on purpose and call me by a nationality which I am not related to apart from my surname. It doesn't seem like much, but I hate it.

One of them never lets me complain about anything just because I get reasonably good grades (which apparently makes me immune to any other problems).

They call me antisocial when I don't talk to them because of this. I still love them as people, but I feel so lonely. 

I only stay with them because I have no one else; everyone else at school views me as weird and a social outcast. Some people even thought I was mute. "

Just to clarify, I am female, and I am definitely not saying it's good to get pregnant at a young age.


Some girls nowadays start their periods as young as 8 years old and this is viewed as normal. But, giving birth this early has a high risk factor (due to smaller bodies and the like), causing complications for both mother and child.


Also, in practically every developed country, a child this age having sex and getting pregnant is rightfully seen as immoral, and is likely a result of rape.


I understand that the average lifespan was significantly shorter before the development of modern medical practices and proper sanitation, so this could contribute to why this is. 


However, the risk of the mother/child dying would be highest for the youngest mothers, so wouldn't this actually have a negative effect on the population? "
