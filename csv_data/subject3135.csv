5," Yes. I remember once when I was hanging out with a group of friends. A friend had to leave because she discovered I had a cold.

Her father had just had a surgery of some sort, and as a result he had little to no immune system. She literally could not hang out with me because the slight chance of transmitting the cold to him could have given him blood poisoning "
6," Small rant here:

Yes I understand that when a lot for people sat this, they mean it as a joke, but you should really be careful joking about this.

Let me explain. The reason we vaccinate is not just to protect ourselves from preventable deadly deseases, but also to protect those who can't vaccinate themselves, like children, elderly or other people with some medical condition that prevents them.

If an antivaxxer would stumble across arguments like this they would gladly agree with them, because if they get the option to not vaccinate, they would take it. But what they fail to see is that they're exposing other people to danger. Aka they're breaking the Herd Immunity.

As I said, I acknowledge that this is probably a joke, but it's a dangerous thing to joke about, because someone might be influenced to believe it's a good idea. And if the person saying the joke is one of them, well, then it's important to stress these points. "

14," Exactly. I also encountered a situation recently where I realised just because I can interrupt the fight, doesnt mean I should.

I was on the train when I started to hear shouting. I checked and two people were keeping a third person on the floor. I prepared myself to jump in to break up the fight, taking off glasses etc. 

But as I got closer I realised that no one was in real danger. Yes, people were obviously hurt, but no seemed to have taken any serious damage. Also people around tried to calm both sides down and de-escalate the fight. So I stayed nearby, but made sure that cops were called and all that "

Caught plague
 This is 049, the Plague Doctor. He will attempt to operate on anyone carrying The pestience, which we believe is what he calls the plague. People that he operates on may then become zombies.

Seen 096
096 is a dangerous scp sometimes who will kill anyone who has at any point observerd him. This is evident by a cobtainment breach where he suddenly started to rampage and broke free and then proceeded to go kill a man. It was later discovered that this man had seen four pixels of 096 in the background of a photo. "

68," Thats for sharper turns, when youre doing a really gradual turn, displacing the centre of mass is enough to induce a small amount of leaning.

When youre doing a sharp turn, you need to get the bike to lean more, and you do that by turning the opposite way, helping you getting the bike to lean more

Edit: Try getting on a bike, go and do something like a sharp 120 degree turn, that should stress the point "
69," Im dont know the exact details, but you would motice if youre ever riding a bike/MC.

When youre turning the front wheel one way, the bike starts falling towards the opposite way.

As your bike is falling, you turn the steering back and now its pointing the same way your bike is accelerating, making that direction the one youre going.

By using knowledge of the stars, its easy to find out what hemisphere youre on. Its also possible to find out true North / South.

Next step is to wait untill dawn. When the sun rises, you calculate its angle of rise compared to the compass youve previously made.

At dawn is also the time you make your call. Think of dawn as a vertical line which moves across the globe.   By calling and letting them know its dawn they will know where this line is. By also giving them the measurements youve taken, they should be able to calculate where on this line you are.! "

Young 10year old me loved pokemon, and by then I was playing pokemon diamond, thus I choose the original name of Infernape Lover

Some years later I started playing minecraft (the cracked variant because teenage me cant buy stuff on the internet). It had a feature of setting your own nickname. As I was playing I realised my name was too long to fit on a single row on the signs.

Then I misstyped my name infernapenover which surprisingly was a perfect fit. So when I bought minecraft, that was the name I went by.

However, as I started playing online years down, noone ever called me my full name, they nicked me infer instead. I concluded that my name was still too long. I started tinkering. I wanted to keep the infer part as that was what people called me anyway.

Being 14ish I realised I could portmanteu inferno with nova (infernova) and that was the coolest shit ever. Also relatively unique, havent had too many troubles getting that username. "

191," One session our party was exploring a dungeon. We got to a crossroad where our options was a small door to the left, and a big door to the right. Most characters were too big to fit through the smaller door, so we tried our luck at the bigger one.

I, playing a monk, asked the DM how tall the door was, and he answered I dunno. Big. Maybe like 200ft and the keyhole 100? I quickly realised I could easily dash up to the keyhole, walk throught it and continue.

Later in the dungeon I came upon a room with a lava pit (also som pillars sticking up, probably for jumping on). How far to the other side mr DM?
Oh, lemme look here. 100ft! You can guess what happened next.

Later on, in the semifinal room, in a big labyrinth, we stumble upon a LARGE lethal snake. We tried fighting it first, but it took me two turns before I was on deathsaves, so after the cleric had healed me, I picked them up and noped the fuck out of there. "

*Friend: The letters. Some of the keys input the wrong symbol, (I cant remember the exact letters, but it was something  and some shift+letters)

*Me: Sounds like your computer thinks youre using probably an english keyboard, check in your settings which keyboard youre using.

*Friend(after some minutes): Shit I found it! Thanks mate!

Because good weapons are expensive not everyone from this party can afford one, therefore all the money have been pooled to make/get one/few weapons and the rest have formed a line to drive the animals towards the rangers.

         a) A swear. The man had an old shortsword lying
around thought that its range was its       shortcoming. So he put it on a long stick to increase its range.
         b) A two sided die. Its a flat wooden construct with a 1 engraved on one side, and a 2 one the other.
         c) A magic crystall which can store magic, and upon activating it will release it. Because of its low quality it cant tolerate anything stronger than a cantrip and they usually break upon use. Its not uncommon for them to break from smaller shocks either, resulting in a small firecracker-esque explosion not even strong enough to harm a bird. However because of the crystals rich potassium and phospate content it can be used as the most excellent fertilizer. This also explains why the scientists garden is completely overgrown. "

Because once youve eaten your first, you have about 5 minutes to get rid of the rest before you will have gulped them all down.

The worst part isnt even the addictive part. When I ate my first bag I didnt realize how good they were, and in a really short span they were consumed, and because of their marshmallow like guts, those WILL clog yours.

I once had a bag and opened it in front of my friend, said Whatever you do, dont eat one, ate one for myself, and placed it right it in front of him, with the opening towards him.

He took one, tasted it and within a minute when he had eaten his 5th and realized how addictive they were he threw them in my face and we agreed to bury them.

So yeah, to answer your question. Bamsemums "

So our party has several murderous psychopaths who I honestly wonder are even close to being good.

After a long playsession were we almost killed ourselves several times without even being in combat our DM presented what he had planned for us.

His plan was as following: 
First we were supposed to speak with some old acquaintances and see if we could get a boat and sail towards the Big Bad Evil Guy (BBEG).

As we went to the harbour, there would be one functioning ship and a shipwreck. If we were to explore the shipwreck we wouldve found an injured girl whod been damaged by magic crystals, to teach us they are bad.

DM then thought we would steal the literally only available ship and sail off to fight the BBEG.

INSTEAD

We made pur way to the har pyr. There, we overdose on Arcana crystals and two of us got arrested and put in rehab.

Everybody ignores the boat and its captain by the way.

We got out of rehab and found ourselves at the top of a hill, with a straight line down to the harbour where the rest of our party. I, the cleric, was on 33/64 hp and the sorcerer was on 1/48.

The sorcerer is lying unconscious in a cart and I realise as soon as I move the cart, it would go rampaging downard. I also dont realise that hes on 1hp. The doctor ordinates sleep will do it.

I jump in the cart. What could possibly go wrong?

One crash site a few hundred meters below, and 50 damage later, the sorcerer is instakilled and we collectively pulled together to pump as much lifeheal into him, desperate to push him back alive.

250hp+ was dished out and we even tried turning him into a vampire hoping some undead might bring him back. After pooping out over 150hp myself I drop down on 0hp and start throwing death saves.

Our bald undead vampire tabaxi bard runs aboard the ship and starts pressing all the buttons. He rolls a critical 1, and DM said: You know what, thats it for this time. Well continue next week. Stood up and told us what he thought wed do.

Tl;dr: Instead of stealing a ship and sailing off fighting the bad guy, our party overdosed on arcana crystals, were put in rehab, resuciated our wizard by turning him into a vampire, and then probably blowing up a ship. "

But this was in the summer and the sun came out, and me being an edgy 14 yr-old went back inside with my half eaten apple to grab my cap and sunglasses. A teacher appeared and presented me with an ultimatum, go back outside and finish the apple, or bin it right here.

354," Elesia, hill-dwarfen cleric

Her earliest memories are of her growing up with life clerics and there she learned of how to help those in need preserve life, but she never seemed to awaken any magic powers.

But that didnt stop her from traveling the lands and helping those on the brink of death. On her travels she met a devastated man whomd lost his will to live, and was starving himself to death on the street. 

Elesia then took time listening to this depressed mans story, and every time she came back to this town, she would stop by and visit this man.

Eventually she and this man would get engaged, and on the evening of their engagement, a mystic girl appeared in the crowd as time slowed down. This girl somehow altered Elesias soul and since then Elesia have been blessed with the power of magic.

Elesia thereafter joins a rebel army who are revolting against a demonic queen, whilst her soon-to-be husband (Orag) joins a small party, trying to earn money to acconplish their goal of building a hospital.

Orag gets drawn in to this plot to kill the demon queen, but sadly the queen hexes him, enslaving him. Orag being a formidable fighter, sadly berzerks and goes down in a blaze of glory, killing the majority of his party.

Elesia, saddened by Orags departing ups her effort to dethrone this tyrant and joins the elitesquad of the rebel army, along with three veterans and three new recruit, in order to dethrone the queen before she hurts anyone else. "

Maybe differentiate between the open areas? I can imagine that closer to the cliffs its more barren, maybe patches of grass, but closer to the cities, I feel that you might wanna dedicate some land towards farming?

The cities have to get their food somehow, and only hunting (fishing for the coastal ones), probably wont cut it, especially for the larger cities.

Also: not everyone lives in cities, maybe add some smaller houses or clusters. So towards the coast you might have a large city, but inland one might find a small setlement living by a busy road?

433," I had by the end of 9th grade crush on someone, without having realised it before. It was school prom and I realised that after this night I'd probably never see her again unless I did something.

So I tried telling her. Sadly the music was too loud, and it was really the last moment, as she had to leave immediatly, so she left without knowing.

That night however, I woke up having recieved a text from her asking what I tried to say. So I just said it. "

Me and my friend were playing with some AI:s. Because my location and military was enough to keep me safe, and from being a threat, thus I was never fighting with someone.

I managed to befriend ALL the ai, and I gt 4/6 of them to declare war on my friend (that part was just for shits and giggles). "
438, Works better in swedish with Obi Wan Knubbi 
439," I have a favourite question I got in a maths competition here in Sweden.

""A school has three classes, all containing boys and girls, and are equal in size. Total, there are twice as many girls than boys.

Class A has 18 girls, Class  B 8 boys, and the last class has more boys thans girls. How big are the classes?""

444," Stress seldom works. Instead of freaking out and stressing over the situation, calm down, accept the current state, and calmly deduce a way to solve it.

For instance: You've missed your bus and will be late. Well there is no point stressing. Well shit you're late, but there's nothing really you can do. Wait for the next bus or whatever, but don't stress over the fact that you will be late.

There's a slight difference between being stressed, and in a hurry. I mean, you might as well *hurry* to mimize your lateness, but there is absolutely no point *stressing* and getting anxious about it. "

458," What's your favourite civilisation to play as, and why? "
459," I had a serious crush on someone. First we talked at all, but then it suddenly changed as we seemed to be interacting more and more.

After summer holidays, we got back to school, and it turned out that me, my crush, and my best friends from the other class, all had some classes together. She sits next to me during those classes because it's mixed and I'm the one she knows best.

My friends later pointed out that I'd been choosing to spend time with her over my close friends. Shortly after it struck me that she seldom talked about something personal, and that it felt as if I was always chasing after her to keep up. There had been times when she literally disappeared without saying anything, or waiting etc.

The final piece to the puzzle unravelled just a few days ago, when an friend of mine, (whom I haven't really been with at all recently) sat beside me, my crush, and my crush's friends. Then some time through lunch everyone left, except my friend, because she wasn't done eating. My initial reaction was: ""I can't leave my friend, she ain't done eating"". So Whilst the others (crush inclusive) left without even noticing two of us were left behind.

 "
460," I mean, the biggest difference is the mm. The T-44 was buffed with armour as far as I remember, but the t-34 should be the same. T-43 was a great fun tank with decent overall stats. I seldom fired gold, and the alpha was decent.

Both were awesome toptier bullies, and worked okay as a support in MT wolfpacks. Overall they were decent tanks I wouldn't mind playing for fun again. "
461," I've never had too much trouble with people spamming gold, obviously an e4 or jgeroo are gonna shit through it.

Whatever you do, just make sure to hide your lowerplate. Your ass has more armour than it. If you angle heavily, most tanks are going yo bounce off your superstructure.

You pretty much need the top gun though, and tha gun works wonders. I always try to get as close as possible, but not being frontline because not having a turret makes you inflexible.  "
462," I've never three marked a tank, but the first I two marked was my 13 90 (whilst it still was T8), and I was hella surprised, and proud too. "
463," The t-43 was actually very fun as I remember it. It was the same with the T-44, but that was before they changed mm "
464," Short info about me first: My hair is incredibly fluffy. Frontally, my hair has a larger width than my face.

Now to the story: I was going somewhere, usual stuff, and as usual I bike. As I pass a busstop, a random girl maybe 10-13 yrs old reaches out and just touches my hair as I wizz by maybe 5 m/s. It's not terribly fast, but it isn't that slow either.  "

475," Grille15. Basically the same as Swedish td:s, except it hits harder but not as often, however often and accurately enough "
476, More like kill the assisstant 
477," Yes. I think the super heavy dilemma stems from this. It had been consensus almost that armourbwas going obsolete, due to ""gold spam"" and weakspots, and also new players who don't know how to use it properly.

So they buffed armour on some tanks and people grew mad "
478," S1, cdc and t54mod1. Albeit I haven't played the t54mod1 after it was buffed, but otherwise it's such a boring tank "

484," All places on a tank with viewport I think. For instance cupolas tend to have viewports, thus you are only required to put your cupola over the ridge.

That is also how someone can permatrack you by shooting rear-drivewheel e.g. without you spotting back because there is cover between yout viewports and opponent.

(There are usually viewports close to the gun too, above/below gun mantlet, I think the base of the gun even counts as one.) "

491," I would say, no mods that are useful during the battle. Maybe last known HP, but things XVM. I started enjoying WoT again when I switched off XVM and decided to never more use it. My reasoning is, if a player is good, let them show that in combat.

I know some of these are bifunctions of xvm, but mods that lock gold and free xp are useful. There's also a mod which can show you after battle where and how tanks penetrated you. "

When they return to their car they found out someone had stolen their box, filled with garbage, thinking they'd stolen a tv. "
513," The biggest supporting difference is that TD:s generally have larger guns, and thus more stopping power. You may have encountered some russian td:s su-85, su-100, su-152. These tanks can be equiped with rather large guns, or just rapid firing or high penetration. The 152 mm of the su-152 is enough to oneshot some tanks, so of course they're gonna be careful. "
514," What confused me the most in the beginning was the whole garage. There was really little about how crews worked. What the percentage mean, how they are transferable but with some loss. Skills/perks etc.

I also did!'t by my first piece of equipment until like tier VI because I had no idea which ones were good / worth the credits "

The I usually spend it on premium for a weekend when I feel like playing a lot. 

I seldom pay for camo, but sometimes I will on a tank I like.

Otherwise gold is primarily for demounting equipment, because the credits you lose otherwise add up quickly.

If I'm in a really bad mood, I might free experience to make stock grinds less painful. "
518," IMO:

My favourites are Malinovka, Redshire, Fiery Salient/ Prokhorvka, and lakeville.

522," There are no proper differences. The only concrete fact is that EU 1 is almost always more populated, and this slightly faster mm, especially as people have pointed out, when there are few online.

One thing I've noticed, although it was months ago, is that there is a unwritten rule, that clan wars and team battles usually happens in EU-1, so the mm there will be way better.

Now I haven't done any of those properly at least since 2016, so I'm not 100% sure.

Edit: Auto usually puts me in EU-2, and I never notice any difference "
523," It's just a tank which oretty much 100% fits my playstyle. My friend has tried goldspamming in it, and yet he never got above 1st class, and he's a good player too.

I just feel bad for him that he can't enjoy the tank as much as I do "
524, I do it like once a year. I always forget why my harddrive is so cluttered xd 
525," The strv s1. I just hate playing it. It does not fit my playstyle at all and I can't even get good results in it even if I wanted.

The strv m42/57 on the other hand is an amazing machine. I ace it like every 4-8 battles and completely wreck the competition. It's also one of few tanks which I've gotten my second mark on too. (That's good for being me) "
526," I remember a time when IS-6 was still considered good, and they haven't even nerfed it since. "
527," They also use large(er) autoloaders too, so that will be acquired experience "
528," I mean they're better now, by a lot. I don't know how good you are, but I think it's educational to try every type of tank, to learn it's playstyle, strengths and weaknesses.

It might be hard not having any armour or hp, but it will be educational if you have patience, and an open mind, willing to learn and accept that you're not perfoming as good as you could.

What requires most patience (or money), is getting a good crew going, especially sixth sense, and some camo and viewrange.

You should definitely try light tanks some time though.

Edit: By the way, the elc was way better, and way more fun before 9.18 or 9.17. It was faster, and the gun was better. I did my first set of 15 LT missions in that one. "

540," Perks too. If they're 100%, they will apply. "
541," I'd say got average after 4k games maybe,. I really can't remember. But I do remember the time when I got the IS-3. Finally I was facing tanks of all tiers. Thus I was getting to know the last tanks, and took part of the high tier meta. 

Then I went against all my more experienced friends recommendations and grinded the french light tanks. After many painful games in the 13 90 I learned how to play in the flow of the battle.

Point I want to make, is that I learned a little for every new tank/playstyle I tried. I start bad, but grow more accostumed and never solely place the blame on my team. "
542," Sixth sense needs to be trained to 100% on your commander for it to work. If it's 99%, it won't work.

If you do convert your experience to crew experience after every battle (the tick box above your crew in elited tanks), the least trained will recieve an xp bonus.

That said, everyone get's xp, but the least trained gets a bonus, but at the cost of convertible xp.

For every percentile progress you get on a skill, the more xp is required. You can go from 0-30% in one battle, but 98-100 may take over ten battles.

Your crew must also have 100% efficiency in your tank in order to keep training your skills. (This is counted without bonuses you get from Vents, BiA, Your commander or premium consumable) "
543, No. Skills apply no matter the profficiency.

For starters, Napoleon wasn't short. Goldfishes do not have a three second memory etc. "
547," Just a general rule of thumb. Aim at tracks for critical damage, maybe gun if you're lucky. Tbf you're right though, especially since superheavy is quite meta rn "
548," Precisely. However, if you have a large ammo capacity there's no harm in bringing some extra. "
549," There are three main cases:

When the enemy has thin armour. If you can penetrate HE, you will do alot of damage, for instance against Skorpion G.

When the enemy has thick armour, and you otherwise can't penetrate your silver/gold rounds. This is some guaranteed damage, but not as much as penetrating AP.

When you must do damage. This is a rarer case, but say the enemy is close to win by capping. Then doing 5 HE splash damage is enough to decap, and save the game. Also good for locking someone by tracking them for a teammate.

Usually, the larger the caliber, the more effective HE. (Compare Jgdpnzr E100 85mm with T-100LT 50mm) "
550," I got steel wall in Skorpion G once. Skorpion op, plz nerf armour "
551," I based this list upon a lix between how fun a tank is to play and how well it makes credits.

Strv m/42-57 -Really fun to play, and easy to perform well in.

M4A1 Ravioli - Comfortable to use, and makes good credits.

FV ""Prius"" 4202 - Ok at making credits. I personally get stable results. (I've got a good crew, probably why I like it).

Skorpion G - It's fast and got a big gun. Nail a few shots and you're having a good game.

T34-85m - Decent alround tank. I really need a crew trainer for all those russian meds

Tiger 131 (Heavy tank no 6?) - Really decent tier 6 heavy with an extraordinary gun. Really good in platoons.

Cromwell Blin - It's a good tank, but I prefer the Strv more.

T28 htc - Pretty steadfast tank, which can hold it's own surprisingly well.

SU-122-44 - Imagine the Skorpion G but at tier 7.

Pz 58 Mutz - It's mediocre. It's probably due to my lousy crew, but it's ok. "

562," About the winrate. Sometimes, you're carrying your team more than you think. 

By placing a small, seemingly insignificant shot in the beginning, you may have just tipped the scales in your favour by forcing some guy to use their repairkit etc.

Hypothetical scenario:

You're playing redshire and you're team completely ignores the eastern flank, so you decide to go there. There you face 5 heavies and manage to hold them back 4 minutes, and take 3 of them down with the help of arty, and some TD far back. But you lose in the end. Yes, you did carry your flank, but in the end your team lost because they got surrounded.

Instead you might've placed yourself between your teams western flank, your 'basecampers' and the enemy push to the east. This might not give you the highest wn8, the highest damage, or most blocked by armour, but it may carry your team to victory.

I'm not telling you to camp, you'll learn this gradually by playing the game, by reading the map and adapting to the situation.

That's one thing I've learned. What's best for the team might not always be what's best for your stats. "

I never touch a tank tier 4 or below either, because those tanks are too unpredictable. And being a T-28 vs a cromwell or KV-2 isn't fun either. "

593, Reminds me of that guy playing overwatch with bananas 
594," It was back in ninth grade. By that time I was pretty bored by math as elementary school maths was easy to understand, thus not very challenging, and we moved at a slow pace.

Later that year I found out my school was giving out extended mathcourses. I thought to myself that I was pretty decent at math and was up for the challenge. So I took it.

During this course I fell in love with math as I learned alot of new stuff, and interesting applications that I'd never even imagined maths could be used for. "
595," The 13 90. Because I was shit then, and it constantly met majority of tier tens, I relied on spotting and assistance anyway. The top gub wasn't really all that different since alot of the shits never connectef anyway.

The T-10 wasn't all that bad either. That grind was actually pretty painless, since the IS-3s gun carry iver, and you don't need to unlock the turret for the gun. "
596," IS-3, amx 13-90, strv m42/57 and perhaps the FV4202 are my favourite tanks.

IS-3: It's russian, it's got armour, and that gun is absolutely killing it, slaughtering T34s who think they are safe properly hull down.

Amx 13-90: Get that crew leveled up and increase that camo+viewrange. It's now better than ever with improved mm, it's no longer always facing 13 tier Xs. The new gunhandling+pen is angelic too.

Strv m42/57: The autoloader is great for picking off same tier opponents. The small turret and great viewrange makes it surprisingly good at working ridges at ranges.

FV4202: It's versatile and the gun hits often, and inflicts damage too with that high pen.

Edit: Grammar "
597," I try to think, how much standard will I need to take to do a decent amount of damage without having to fire gold.

That's why my t-54 almost has 45/45/10 % loadut, because of the ammo capacity. I almost NEVER use the gold though, but if I am forced to, I have already fired 20+ rounds and probably am in a situation where I need to make my shots count to win the game. "
598," Or you could get Temair to blowbit all away, along with half the interior "
599," Kv-13, t-43, t-44, were all wo derful tanks to play, and pretty much no gold fired either. "

602," You should try logging in on their website and resend verification email if possible.

603," It's all about getting the knowledge (weakspots, angling, map awareness erc).

By tier 5 the game gets more standardised. Lowtiers are unpredictable with all the beginners who don't follow the map meta, as well as the countless sealclubbers.

I've returned to low tiers a few times, and they were essentially hell, so I draw the line at tier 5, (6 before mm change). I haven't dared ti touch tier 4 or below for half a year maybe. "

620," Reminds me of a game I had in the Jgdpnzr E100. I was bust angling towards a whole bunch of enemies pounding away on my armour, and I thought I just had to accept it.

He ended up ramming, and then shotguning me, thus splashing himself to death "

638," I'm pretty sure it has to with sealclubbers. Since it is a lowtier tank, alot of players will have access to it, especially inexperienced players. Thus they drag the average xp down.

But since so many sealclubbers probably play it, they get great results, thus making it harder to ace. 

In oractice that means, 95% of players don't get above 650 xp, but the percentiles between 95-99 get between 650 and 954.

Edit: Right numbers "
639, Something something sealclubbers 
640," I always use Ballograaf mechanical pencils, it's a dream to write with.

The reason I don't use pens is because the lack of friction makes my handwriting faster, but more sloppy, thus harder to read and therefore I make less errors.

This was one of the most enjoyable grinds that I've done. And I pretty much never fired gold. The awesome mobility and gun handling never let me down (let alone russian bias).

Sure enough I can't get the obj 430, but I thought I'd go down the lightline anyway. (This was before the lightank update) "
648," I mean, my last few days of WoT, I got the T62a. And driving that tanks feels like ghostrider "
649, That is a result pretty much anyone would be happy with 
650," Reminds me of this time when I was trying the new Swedish tanks, the low tier ones. I was on Mittengaagd, and for whatever reasons he tracked me before going down, as in several shots. 

Eventually he got bored and stopped so we both drived down, but he, going real fast drove into me, causing damage, thus turning blue and getting banned. "
651," I found what was holding me back in my first games was knowledge. I had no knowledge of maps or tanks. 

The easiest way to solve this is just by playing the game and gathering experience. 

You might want to try watching youtubevideos. I find such as Jingles, Qb:s usersubmitted videos efucative and they usually feature several gamemechanics that are useful to know.

As people here have pointed parts of the community can be pretty toxic, so learn to ignore them. But still, don't be afraid to ask for help.

Last words of advice: Stay away from XVM. XVM and WN8 has never brought me anything good. You will see ""statistically good"" players and bad ones do extremely stupid stuff. The RNG gives worse players a chance to beat the statpadders and sealclubbers.

Lemme tell you something. Just play the game because it's fun. If it isn't fun, don't play it. I have a friend who cares about his stats. He is the one most likely to spam gold, check up a players stats afterwards and rage. And he hates the game the most and rages every game.

(Tbf he rages at every game, even in coop-minecraft) "
652, Well you clearly don't need any of them except one xD 
653, r/theydidthemaths ;) 
654," Well, the Ghandi one is an old meme which stems from an old civ-game where Ghandi:s peacefulnes caused a bug where he was the most aggresive one of all.

On a scale 1-10 I think he was a solid 10. Higher levels of aggresivness means they are more likely to nuke you. Civs never went that high pretty much, except Ghandi "
655," I like to think of World of Tanks as chess. All tanks are like the pieces, they move differently and have different weaknesses and strengths.

When you play, make sure to read the minimap and pay in unison with ypur team in a way that benefits the team and not your stats (i.e. WN8). "
656," Yeah. It's a bit situational, but those kinda tanks like being hull down behind a ridge or something, so with a little bit of rng and positioning, once every second/third shot you will hit under ideal circumstances. "
657," Maus got an armour AND hp buff. Type 4 and type 5 heavy both got derpguns, the latter does 1400 dmg with prem HE.

Arty is more accurate and annoying than ever with their stun, BUT they no lpnger have AP/HEAT rounds and will almost never one-shot you

This update also brought multiuse consumables that will be consumed by the end of the battle. Oh, medkits removes stun.

LT:s had a major update and their mm are the same as all other tanks and therefor alot of them have been tweaked.

MM is now in three forced formats with tiering. You will either have 3/5/7 ; 5/10 or pure tiered battle. (Hightier/Midtier/lowtier)

Quite some amount of tanks got tweaked. Too many OP tier 8 premiumtanks have been released. E25 was again.

Swedish tanks have been released. Heavy tanks have ridiculous frontal turret armour, but turret side can be overmatched. The heavies also have autoloader similar to the french heavies.

The swedish td:s (IKEA tables) have paper armour and rely on heavy sloping to survive. They have good camo and high speed, 50 forward and 45 backwards.

The IKEA tables use siege mode to tilt the whole tank to be sloped over a ridge to expose minimal of the tank. The gun itself is special. It gets about 300-310 base pen with APCR and prem rounds is APCR with a shit ton of pen. It's accurate af and gets a ludicrous dpm.

The german techtree got a new heavytank line. The vk 45.02B  now leads to Vk. 7 (something) and to take it down, just shoot whatever that's flat.

New tier 8-9 tanks, Vk100.01P and Muschen have been added and they lead to the Maus. These are very similar to Maus itself, but with cupolas.

Edit: WG had a fuckup and lost 3 community contributors, Jingles PointyhairedJedi and SirFoch. And pissed off the others ontop of that. (It was about youtube, copyrightstrikes and censorships) "
658," Not that often considering it's excellent gun-handling.

My first reaction was that it's gunhandling was comparable with that of tier 9-10 vehicles. Just let the circle shrink before you poke and you will be hitting whatever you want "
659," Yeah. Against a knowledgable player in the right tank, few of the american turrets are always good. 

What I mean is high calibers pen them all the time (IS-7) by overmatching the turret top, which you therefor have to hude with gun dep.

But it's seldom I see people utilising this "
660," Frra sommaren skrev dem bara ""xxxxxx"" "
661," Kommunen skickade i slutet av Mars ut brev till dem ungdomar i kommunen som skt sommarjobb, och detta med Postnord. Frn kommunhuset till mitt hus r det cirka 2km.

April r ver och jag utgr ifrn att jag inte blev erbjuden ngonting, men NEJ! 2:a Maj dimper ett brev ned i brevldan. Frn kommunen till mig, leverantr: Postnord... "
662," People say that the T-54 has shite pen. Maybe it does. But I'd like to cliam that it's peb is very workable as it gets tremendous gunhandling.

It's super accurate even on the move, and combine that with it's decent mobility, and you can comfortably outflank your enemy and put ahots into their weakspots. "
663," Actually the cinemas in Sweden offer 3d-glasses, which are built so they could either be worn by normal people, or they could be clipped ontop you're regular glasses "
664," People have already solved it mathematically, but I'm just curious if there is someone who wants to resolve the problem, and taking in other factors, such as baby-booms in November (or 9 months after valentines day hint hint).

Some cultures also have bias towards certain birthdayes, such as early in the year etc "
665, Have you build the prefollowing buildings? 
666," But with the new matchmaking you won't constantly be shat on by tier 10 tanks. If you're alone you will benefit the most from the new mm.

If you're in a platoon, well you're in a platoon, good for you.

Yes, Amx 30 is a sniper, but an aggressive one. I found that it's speed, hp/t, gun flexibility and viewrange allow you to find nice spots where you can outflank the enemy and spot and support your team "
667," Once you get away from the stockparts and get a crew which doesn't suck (which you probably will have, because amx 30 is the first medium tank in the tree), the amx 30 is pretty fun to play "
668," Never look at someone's statistics and don't even let XVM come near your harddrive.

As some people here said, someones super unicum stats says nothing about them until you see them play. They may just have sealclubbed at lowertiers and is then camping to max damage without being of use to the team.

Assume, that if you're not contributing to the team right from the start, that they'll collapse. I always make sure that I am in some way always helping my team win.

IF you get enraged anyway, DON'T chat with someone or rage somewhere, you will only fuel it. Try to stop the madness, otherwise you will make mistakes and do stupid things, die and get more mad.

I have a friend who more often than not gets real mad and starts spamming gold and curses at his opponents. And because he spams gold he thinks he's invincible and die because he lost his situational awareness and calm, logical thinking. "
669," That's the point. The keyword are ""HEAT can be"". More often than not, you will at least make up for all the tracks and space absorptionswith the extra pen "
670," You can still get a two-tier battle, i.e. 10 t7s and five T8s per team. But yeah I see your point. Tbf I feel tanks with preferential has alway been like that (At least for the two with pref. I have; the IS-6 and E25) "
671," I don't know how much of the camping experience you're going after, but something you MUST consider is fire. Some parts of Sweden are extremely dry right now (and will continue to be), as such I adivce being extremely cautious woth fire, and check with your region if there is a ban on fires.

This is even more likely to happen at lowtier because sealclubbers hang there and they max out their tank and just outperforms their opponents.

691, Thanks. I remember this update but not it's name. 
692," I've been playing World of Tanks since Christmas 2014. I'm not really a 'new' player but I'm not one of them seasoned players who remember the Type 59. What's this ""Rubicon"" that I've read about seceral times in this forum? "
693," By your description it sounds line you're working towards the T28prot. KV-1 or T-150 might be the tank if you get into the right matchmaking.

 "
694," I think it's range. But also they get to choose between a large inaccurate gun, or a smaller but slightly more accurate gun, but IMO go with the big one because Stahlin will guide your shell eitherway.

They do have a narrow gunarc, so it can be somewhat frustrating havin to reaim, and shelltrajectory is nothing particular "
