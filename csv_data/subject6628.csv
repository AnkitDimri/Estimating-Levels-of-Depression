0," Same. Gave up after three years of trying. My snake didn't get hurt in the last 18+years of live feeding and I'm not doing it all over again.  

The food animals get a quick death. On some occasion they literally exploded. "
1," Alcantara seats are awesome, but I don't like Alcantara steering wheels.

Do I touch it all the time?-leather

Do I only touch it sometimes with bare skin?-Alcantara "
2," Hello neighbor. You got to keep $2600 out of you $3500? That's actually really good! I make more in roughly the same profession and got to keep a lot less percentage wise, not in absolut terms. A Friend who lived in Florida said overall living is a bit more expensive, but it is easily offset by the higher salaries in IT. You will love the fuel and electricity prices. "
3," Because it's 3D Xpoint memory.  The 960 uses 3D MLC NAND. 

3D Xpoint memory has many advantage over MLC. The biggest one would be latency and random read/writes.

Those 2600MB/s is peak sequential write speed. 

For the consumer this really doesn't matter, but there are probably some use cases were optane might be worth the extra cash. "
4," To add, A wider bus means more chips which increases costs. 

The RX 5700 XT can already hit a bandwidth of 448 GB/s. This is higher than all non HBM cards from previous generations including some with a 512bit bus. 

One thing to also keep in mind that the RX5700 XT is still a mid range card with a mid range bus and chip size. The RX5900 xt is still missing. "
5," In my model year it was only optional. I hope they improved it a bit for the facelift, because I only got false alarms out of Audi pre-sense. Haven't been in a situation where it was needed though.

One time where I could understand why it got triggered and the other time it made no sense. I was doing 200kph on an empty highway. That scared the shit our of me. "
6," It's a manual rear wheel drive car which does zero to 100kph in 2.8sec and zero to 200kph in 7.3sec.

So basically Hennessy Venom GT, but build in 1993 and faster on the track. "
7, You can never have enough storage. I'm currently using 22TB at home and am running out of storage again. 
8," My HX1000i and HX800i died. Yet everyone seems to be OK with Corsair. So I figured it was bad luck and going over 500W on Pcie. 
Using evga and seasonic ever since. Really happy with them. "
9," I got my own PC desktop when I was around 8 or 9. Build my own PC at 11.

13 is old enough. At 13 I upgraded to my first high end GPU. This was around the release of crysis which I played in secret. Showed off the editor to my parents though. They had a right to know where all my first hard earned cash went.

I did almost everything on my own back then, no help from family etc. Today everything should be much easier. "
10," First thing is a new PSU

What wrong with the PSU? It has enough power and isn't terrible. I don't see a reason to upgrade if you don't want a modular one. "
11, 2k as in 2048\*1080 or as in 1440p(WQHD)/2560\*1440? Then upgrade your GPU first. I wouldn't go with a RTX2060 though. Either a RX5700 XT or spend a bit more and get the RTX2070 Super. The 3600 would be a nice upgrade too but not that noticeable at 60Hz gaming. 
12, What's you target performance? 144Hz 1080p? 
13," Battlefield seemed ok but it also seemed like the kind of thing that would suck going in solo.

There are enough decent players around that playing solo is alright. 

If you had a great squad with team players just add them. It's no counter strike, You don't need voice communication etc to enjoy the game. Just stick together. "
14," The Ryzen is slightly slower in many games, but when it's not the i5 one is borderline to unplayable. 

i5s are pretty much obsolete.

For streaming the extra headroom of a 3700x might be worth the extra price. 

For 200 the 3600 is the best option. "
15," Yes the facelift A7 MY15 can have the dynamic indicators from factory in Europe.Generally speaking:

LED lights=dynamic tail lights/rear dynamic indicator

Matrix LED=dynamic everything/dynamic indicators front and back

everything else=no dynamic indicators

The LED lights come only standard in the newest facelifted generation, this means only the B9.5. The dynamic LED lights became an option in 2012 I think. "
16," Confidence is the term that describes Audis handling the best. 

I like to listen to classical music and it's not enjoyable if you don't have a good sound system.
Since I got my A4 I started listening classical in my car.

Presense just scared the shit out of me. Imagine driving 210kph and suddenly the car starts beeping like crazy. "
17," Current tanks hold about 5kg of H2 at 690bar.  With this in mind the chemical energy is about 14186Mj. The efficiency of ICE hydrogen engine is about 20%. So this gives you 3940Mj to work with. For comparison the VW ID.R used 89Mj for its run and the 918 evo had a bit over 300Mj. You got a lot of energy to work with for a relatively small energy to weight ratio including the tank(about 5kg of composite material). 

The engines themselves are the problem. 

Everything is higher pressured. You need to make everything sturdier and thus heavier. 

Another problem is cooling. Hydrogen burns much hotter than petrol like engine block melting hot. You need to dump all that heat which adds weight again. 

You can forget about longevity of the engine if you want upwards of 1000hp.

The rest is pretty similar to any other ice car.

Is it doable? Certainly, but it would be a purpose build car more similar to a dragster than a race car. "

Business as usual "
19, Is Germany entering any kind of recession at the moment? Did I miss something? 
20, First time someone suggest Germany is entering a special recession besides business as usual. It's the 90 years anniversary of the Black Thursday and Amazon stock just dipped. Both not related to Germany. Did anything else happen? 
21, Could you clarify? I don't get what you are trying to say with your comment. 
22, 1.7khz panels were already demoed in 2016. 
23, Same for Germany 
24," Actual impact on the daily lives of citizen due to the migrants:

Very little

Political impact due to the migrant crisis:

Huge "
25," If a game is installed you need the CD only for DRM. Usually you can remove it after the game is started. 

Most virtualization software allows you to share every component from with the machine. 

If that doesn't work make an image of the CD and put it into the virtual machine. 

You can always use your PC. 

What are you trying to achieve? Play against yourself on one PC, allow someone to play on a remote connection while you use your PC? "
26, Does Pikes Peak count? 
27, I like how every animal fits within two black lines and than Sauropods are like: 'f*ck you' . 
28, There are so many games with D-day maps out there. Just last week Hell let loose got it. I don't need to see it for the 20th time. There are other big gamecahnging battles which haven't been done to death. 
29," I'm probably one of the few people who actually hoped for unseen battles. I also don't give a fuck if for example D-day makes it into the game or not. 

But at no point I thought the US wouldn't make it. "
30, Same. But Job related or when visiting the US. 
31, Yeah too bad. I hoped for lesser known Japanese vs anybody who is not the US stuff. 
32, The same thing that happened to dragging injured in BF3. 
33," Not me but a friend who was a really conservative christian and has moved to the left quite a bit. He is by no means left wing now but still. 

Two thing changed his mind. 

1. He is a member of the CDU and as he rose up in the ranks. He realized how far removed from reality many were, how lobbyism works(not everything is bad about it though) and how dismissive many were against valid critique from younger generations 
2. Me and my friends. We meet up every friday for our ""Stammtisch"". We also talk a lot about politics then. Most of us are more left leaning compared to him. Everybody learns a lot during our discussions. He change his view on topics like gay marriage, environmental protection, state and church separation, etc.

He still is in the CDU as he still believes in traditional christian values. But He tries to change the CDU from the inside. "
34," There are B9s from 2016. I have one. They are now getting cheaper as more and more come back from 3 year car leases.

That being said why not wait a year and buy it in cash? That's what I did. "
35," Reasons to buy an Audi without quattro over one with quattro

1. Cheaper 
2. Better fuel economy 

Not everybody cares or needs better driving dynamics.

Don't gatekeep and don't act like Audi has nothing else to offer. "

37, When you are in the US army and you friend says I love the M1 
38," After the yu-gi-oh craze ended I bought all the cards from my friends. Still got a couple of thousands. 

Some gems are in there. Early rare editions of white and red eyes. "
39, G703. It's the G403 but better. I've been using logitech mice for over a decade and can only recommend them. I had the G403 wireless for since release and couldn't be happier. Best wireless mouse for fps. Prior to that I used the G502 as a daily. It's heavier and a good allrounder. Before the 502 my daily was a MX518. 
40," I have a very strong grip on my mouse and press the buttons really hard. My mice always get finger dents very soon. I also do this when I write.

I know someone who uses his thumb for D, index finger for W and middle finger for A. "
41," That's strange previous Golf had a shit ton of colour options. 

At least Audi still offers 50+ different ones for each model if you select the Audi exclusive option "
42, I personally would change the rims for daily driving. Other slightly smaller one improve the ride quality and don't scratch that easy 
43, In Europe we also have the 1.8 with 170hp. 
44," personal stakes in AMD

Some of us do though. You are forgetting the people who own AMD stocks for example. 

But I think most stock owners are more mature than the typical drama crowd. "
45," Matrix LED lights are definitely the winner for me. They are less fatiguing than Xenons. The normal visibility is really good maybe not as good as some Laser or Xenon headlights according to some German car magazines but I couldn't really tell a difference. Can't complain about visibility in other conditions either. Maybe fog because more reflection due to their higher brightness?  Auto leveling works great but of course has it's limits. 

Now to the Matrix part. They work great for detecting other vehicles.  Cornering light could be more aggressive but are still good. Turning light are there but could engage sooner. Maybe I'm just driving too fast/breaking too late for turning. 

The best part is the visibility when driving around other vehicle. You can always see what's right next or on the road. Makes you feel a lot safer. And you don't have to engage/disengage the high beams. 

I originally didn't care about them when purchasing my car but now I love them.

I haven't used Mercedes Multibeam LED yet so can't comment on them, but I prefer Matrix LED to BMWs offerings for example. "
46," At least OneDrive is useful. 

Fuck off skype. "
47," I use different browser for different tasks. Chrome for google services, Edge for pdfs and certain work/research stuff, Thor for you know and Firefox for the rest.

Oh and I write this via Edge chromium beta. So far it's a great browser. "
48, 1440p native will look better. 1440p doesn't scale smoothly into 4k like 1080 does. Your image will be blurrier. There are some good methods to make it games at a lower resolution look good on 4k. Features like Radeon image sharpening help. 
49, I game on a  1440p/144hz/IPS monitor longer than I have my current PC. 90+fps on high in ok optimized games is no problem. I don't have to really sacrifice visual quality yet. My CPU remains my bottleneck for the most part in BF1/5 at 90+fps.Don't see a reason to upgrade my gpu. When It comes to cod I wasn't happy with the performance. This most likely wasn't my Vega 64 fault. 1080p low ran shitty as well. Visual clarity and netcode were really bad and felt inconsistent. I hope it's fixed for the release. But I'm sensitive to this kind of stuff. 
50," As a fellow European, I find it strange as well. I would have a hard time deciding if I would remove mine if I could. One thing is for sure, German plates look a lot better on Audis than US plates. "
51," repeat paedophiles

They need help. Statements like this probably deter them from seeking help. 

Repeat child molester etc. are a different story though. "
52," Audi interiors are overrated

I don't know about the new all touch Audis but I will take my B9 over any of it's competitors. Everything just looks, sounds and feels right. "
53," I can as well, but only on my left hand... "
54, I had this problem as well. It was especially bad in school. I got tested but the docs couldn't find something. Years later I had a big seizure. Turns out I'm epileptic and had focal seizures this whole time. 
55, Same. Walking barefoot through fresh snow is one of the best feelings. As a child I used to go directly for a walk when I woke up in the morning and there was fresh snow. Just straight out of the door after waking up. 
56, Wasn kaputt bei dir? 
57," I can bend each finger joint independently from each other, except on my right index finger. "
58," VAG is producing 40 different vehicles based on the MQB platform. Those 40 vehicle come with different variants. 

Roughly 80 different cars between Audi, Seat, Skoda and VW. That's crazy.

It's easy to see why they need a restructuring of their brands.

 #x200B;

VAG is also producing 15 different vehicles on the MLB platform and many of those have all kinds of variants. Most of them are Audis, two Porsche, one Bentley, one Lamborghini and three VWs. "
59," Not to long ago here in NRW the typical police car was a VW Passat. Then they switched to BMW 318s and now they introduce some Ford S-Max.

The standard van is the Mercedes Vito.

In Germany it's different in each state. "
60," Same. I can drink one bottle of beer or one glas of wine per week. If I drink even a tiny bit more on one evening I'm completely hungover. 

I love beer and wine. Those bottles a glasses become something really special. "
61," The average over the last three years was 40mpg(UK). Currently I get around 44mpg(UK) out of my 200kw V6 diesel. 

With the 215bhp diesel and on highways having a speed limit your figures seem realistic. "
62,"  We know some 9m long tyrannosaurs had feathers from head to toe. T.Rex lived in a warmer climate and was 12m long.

 It's most likely like whole woolly mammoth vs. elephant hair situation. Yutyrannus being the woolly mamoth and T.Rex being the elephant. "
63," It's 10kph for cars and 45s for a truck. (According to OLG Hamm and OLG Zweibrcken)

Overtaking has to be completed as fast as possible without breaking other laws.

On the Autobahn this means Richtgeschwindigkeit of 130kph!

( 5 StVO ) "
64, You always have to drive properly. When you drive with 200+kph you still have to move over to the right lane whenever possible. If you are driving faster than 130kph you are always partially at fault for the accident even if your speed has nothig to do with it. This is because with higher speed you cause more damages. 
65," The national parks are great. 

How open and enthusiastic the people are is also refreshing. I think I couldn't take for a long period, but for a few weeks at a time it's great. 

How convenient many things can be. 

And how spacious everything is. "

This is a list of my personal favourites which require a bit more horsepower to run. Witcher 3 and Doom(2016) belong also to those. "
68," I had flickering issues with my RX Vega 64, but that was fixed two years ago. "
69," Sry, I confused cobalt with rare earths. 

How is battery tech pulling away? The energy density per volume is by three digits off. If you include the complete weight of the system its still one digit off. Tanks have made and continue to make huge improvements. Materials like platinum are about to replace by better materials. This includes catalysators in normal ICE vehicles and fuel cells. 

The chemical potential of hydrogen is too big to just dismiss. 

Batteries are great as long as they don't have to carry themselves around or need to store gigantic amounts of energy. Maybe we will get another huge jumps for batteries but simply doubling the energy density is not enough to pull away. 

We'll see in a few years how viable hydrogen is. EV's are already viable, but for me not good enough to dismiss hydrogen. "
70, We are family 
71," For now It's the better solution but in the future this might not be the case. 

Fuel cells and storage is more mass efficient than modern batteries. Refueling way faster. Hydrogen cars also don't rely on huge amounts of rare resources like conventional electric vehicles do. Most of those come from China. "
72," Many reasons.

1. Storing. It's very difficult to store it. Hydrogen goes through almost all materials. You also need to pressurize it to make it volume efficient.
2. Production. It costs a lot of energy to produce. With electrolysis it's about 70-80% efficient, worse than lithium ion storage. 
3. Safety. Hydrogen really likes to go boom. That's what is great about it but also dangerous.
4. Scalability. The most effective way to use hydrogen is a fuel cell. But those don't scale well, which is a problem if you want to but them in a fun to drive vehicle. 

Solutions:

1. Many advancements were made in the last decade or so. Most of the best storage solution aren't commercially viable yet.
2. It's more efficient and safe to produce hydrogen at the gas station instead of transporting it. With the rising use of renewable energy source the excess power can be used to produce it.
3. Modern tanks are designed to brake in a certain way so that large explosion don't happen. The hydrogen would burn and the flame would be pointed in one direction.
4. Fuel cells and storage is more mass efficient than modern batteries it would basically replace then. Recuperation is too valuable to loose so batteries will always have a larger part in vehicles. Hydrogen can also be used in an ICE. This us much less efficient but you can have a much bigger power output. 

Hydrogen has still much potential which is why many companies and Japan heavily invest in further development. It also doesn't rely on huge amounts of rare resources like conventional electric vehicles do. Without more clean energy the losses in production and use, hydrogen is much less environmental friendly than fully electric vehicles are. I personally see them as more viable in the future than EVs if batterie technology doesn't have another big breakthrough. "
73,"  You'd need to design an entirely new transportation system to support transporting massive quantities of hydrogen around,

You don't. You can produce Hydrogen directly at the gas station from water and electricity. The main drawback is the electricity cost. "
74," German road quality can vary quiet a bit. Many parts of the Autobahn in Lower Saxony are in bad condition an permanently und construction, meanwhile country roads a fine. Some parts of NRW are also bad while other bit are so smooth you would ride comfortably without any suspension or tires. On average I would say the quality is higher than in most places. "
75, At that rated speed it doesn't matter if you buy neo or normal trident z as long as they have the same frequency and timings. Choose whichever is cheaper or looks better. 
76, There are certain b450 bords from the likes of msi which were refreshed for Ryzen 3000. Those usually come with a bios ready for Ryzen 3000 and have more storage for future updates. I don't know which exact boards though. 
77," CPU:  Take the R7 3700X and safe a few bucks

CPU cooler: OK

Motherboard: Great board, but do you need the feature of X570 like the PCIe4.0? If no maybe go with b450.

RAM: Nice to have for certain tasks. I personally would keep it. You can always go with 16Gb and upgrade later though.

Storage: NVME isn't that much more expensive than a normal SATA ssd so I would keep it if you don't have to trouble to fit everything in your budget.

GPU: Definitely upgrade from the money you saved on the other components. Either to a Radeon RX5700xt or to a RTX 2070 super depending on budget.

OS: you can get cheaper OEM keys and try to get a windows pro version. "
78," In this case i would choose the 3700X over the 3600. Then you have to decide if the 5-10% more performance in most games of the i9 is worth the money? The R9 is almost the same price as the i9 and you get 50% more cores compared to the R7, this only really matter in productivity tasks. "
79," What are you primarily doing with your computer? 

If you are only gaming the i9 9900k is still king. If you are more on a budget the R5 3600 is great and the R7 3700x is about the same just a bit more flexible for productivity.

The 3900x is the best for productivity by quite a bit but behind the i9 in gaming. "
80," I just bought a MSI Optix MAG271CQR when it was on sale for sub 350.

I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. It has a VA Panel but the pixel response time and motion clarity are really good and even better with blur reduction. Blur reduction doesn't work in conjunction with freesync though.

Black levels are ok but not as good as I expected. The colors are Ok but a bit too blue even after trying to correct it. But I'm spoiled by my Eizo IPS monitor and LG OLED TV, both more than twice your budget.

Contrast and brightness on the other hand were better than expected. Viewing angles are better than a TN but not as good as my IPS or other VAs

Build quality is also a plus.  And for whatever reason it has rgb on the back. From the front it doesn't look too gamery.

For 350 it's awesome value. US pricing should be sub $400 USD, still great value. If I'm primarily gaming this is my monitor of choice now, my Eizo is for work(video, photo editing etc.) and my OLED for movies and certain games. "
81, It'll look even better with better cable management 
82," They got a lot better design wise in the last few years. This is partially because the Hyundai Motor Group brought in German engineers who previously worked for companies like Audi. 

You also seem to get what you pay for, still good value. 

SsangYongs seem to get more common but they are still rare, really basic and not something to get excited about. "
83, Why? 
84, How did BF performance improve once you got to the R7 3700x? Curious because we have a 'similar' PC. 
85," Just play around a bit with the infotainment.

Driver profile will be saved for each key(heated seats for example).

If your key battery is empty you need to start your engine within 15second after unlocking or the alarm will start and you can't simply turn it off again.

Those kind of tips?

 #x200B;

edit: Also make sure they give you the vehicle code. IT's usually attached to the primary key in a plastic tag. "
86, New architecture new problems. This kind of stuff is sadly normal for AMD and Nvidia. AMD still lists a bunch of known issues and Nvidia is just needed to roll out another hotfix. Later this year we'll get a big update hopefully Navi will then be close to were Polaris is atm. 
87," I personally don't like the gameplay of Hardline, but it did a lot of things right. "
88, Naja nicht die alten dinger. Deren Grundausstattung kommt aus den 80ern. 
89," TRUE all around sub 7ms means that pixels can always reach their target color within 7ms independent from their starting and target color. So if the red value is 10 and needs to be at 200 it can do the change within those 7ms. Same with any other combination. If a monitor has overshoot it means it reaches 200 within the window but reaches a value higher than 200 at one point, for example 220 and then falls back to 190, then 205 and finally 200. Usually the first time it reaches 200 is mentioned as the response time to look good on the spec sheet. 

If a panel hast true 3ms and 144Hz it can hold the complete frame for 3.9ms, meanwhile a 6ms panel only 0.9ms. So a true 6ms panel has more ghosting aso than a true 3ms panel even if both fall within the 144Hz refresh window. 

If you want to see this effect pushed to the extreme put a good OLED which can have true sub 1ms next to a 144Hz VA. The clarity is unreal. Good OLEDs need image processing or really high framerates to make them bearable. 

CRTs are a completely different story. "
90," The panels improved a bit. Really good IPS panels can now achieve a sub 7ms time independent of color change(g2g,w2w,etc) and without overshoot so true 144Hz is possible and really good VAs can achieve sub 10ms now. "
91," They actually have the most powerful graphics cards

One card has basically two Vega 7 with all 64 CUs enabled compared to the normal desktop 60.

So overall 28.4Tflops compared to Nvidias 16.3 Tflops Quadro offering. Nvidia doesn't do Dual GPU graphics cards anymore so they don't have the most powerful card. Only the most powerful GPU "
92," Didn't know this was a thing. Is it similar to something like the rabbit edition? 
We don't get those here in Germany. "
93, Why did you put the name of the German highway system in your flair? 
94," 18 Golf GTI Autobahn 6MT

What's up with the Autobahn in your flair? "
95," Not bad. When I bought mine the dealer had one from 2012 with 215kmiles.

All high mileage A7s are 3.0TDIs here in Germany "
96, I'm more of a XJ13 guy. 
97," Nope, it was mph. 190 to 210kph. I had rentals in California and Florida and driving on a 3 or 4 way highway scared the shit out of me. 
The way the traffic is plays a huge role.
 If you are only overtaking with a relatively small speed difference, the flow of the traffic is clear and everybody knows there is no speedlimit, 200kph isn't that fast. "
98, Congratulations. Today seems to be the grey A6 50tdi delivery day.... 
99," Out of curiosity, where do you live and what's considered fast? "
100, Of course it depends on many factors but usually something between 120 and 130mph if the highway is relatively empty. 
101, A lot if you have the wrong tyres 
102," My work is right next to the Autobahn. I drive directly onto the highway slowly accelerating to 85mph . After the engine and oil is warm I accelerate further to my normal commute speed.

Taking it slow and not pushing it to much to get to highway speed shouldn't cause any problems for a normal car. 

My last Golf didn't have any issues after 4 years of doing this. "
103,"  If I look through the hundreds of emails I received last month from people all over the world

 there is no ""Sincerely yours,"" in sight. Similar story with letters, but the sample size is very small. 

""Sincerely yours,""  seems to have passive aggressive undertones. 

""Best regards"", ""Thank you"" etc. have a much friendlier vibe. "
104, A Speeding camera. You can find some looking like this in France. 
105," I really like Mercedes' three pointed star. Simple and elegant. Audi comes in second. 

Of all animal logos I like Cizeta the most followed by certain Peugeot variants (maybe the 1950 one with the golden Lion on a black shield). There are probably some I can't think of which look better. "
106," The PCB is slightly worse than the Powercolor one. But that doesn't really matter, overkill is overkill. "
107," No they're not. Haldex quattro is basically the same as the normal VW 4motion. It uses a electronic clutch.

Meanwhile 'real' quattro uses a torsen diff which operates mechanicly and is always active.

Previous generation haldex system behaved really reactionary/delayed. It should be a lot  better now. "
108," If I had to choose between those cars it would come down to how much I drive and how much space I need.

For long distance driving I would choose the A4, for shorter distances I would go with the S3.

I also wouldn't put all season on the cars. They make your  driving experience worse and aren't as safe. It wouldn't really matter on lower end cars but on Audis? "
109," The misconception that diesels aren't or can't be geared for a high top speed is probably just an American thing. Why would you need to go faster than 85moh in the US?

The important thing for top speed is raw hp and not torque. Many Diesel have a lot torque so they reach peak power with lower rpm. 

Even smaller cars like a Diesel golf are geared to reach over 125mph and they are able to drive this fast with better fuel economy than their gasoline counter parts. 

My car is a diesel with a ZF-8speed automatic and can easily reach 155mph. Most cars which will overtake when you are driving under 100mph on the Autobahn are diesels, because they have a good enough fuel economy to drive this fast for a long period. "
110, Audi steering wheels are definitely the best I've used. Getting into the car after washing my hand and running down from the top to the 3 and 9 driving position is such a great feeling. 
111, Considering the 110kw A5 isn't offered in the US it's pretty obvious that we were talking about European models. 
112, The Passat over here is developed by the Volkswagen Design Center in Potsdam Germany. The Passat the US and China gets is a tweaked (older) one. If that's enough to call it developed by VW Shanghai fair enough. We were talking about the EU models though. 
113," They don't need a turbo charger to achieve 150hp. The engine was designed with a turbocharger, to run more efficient. I doubt the 150hp variant was built from the ground up. I think it's a detuned 190 or 245hp engine with cheaper/smaller/weaker components. Hence the same fuel efficiency as the 190hp one. "
114," PS is Pferdestrke which can directly be translated to horse power. But at the time where HP was relevant Germany already had adopted the metric system because of Napoleon. So they needed to use metric to define one hp. To make things simpler they changed the value of hp a tiny bit. 1PS is equal to the power it takes to move 75Kg at 1m/s against gravity(g) and not the completely weird  33,000ftlbf/min marketing definition James Watt used. "
115, The European Passat was mostly build in Hannover and Emden Germany. Those plants will be producing electric vehicles in the future though. 
116, The passat is a bit leighter because it's a stretched golf and they drive quite differently. The transmission is also important. On the other hand the A5 has more torque. It will give you a rough idea but don't expect them to be too similar otherwise. 
117, Call the dealer first and make an appointement. If they don't have a new one or one in their rental fleet ask for a used one. 
118," The car will be comfortable at any speed it can reach with that engine. The problem is how you get there. Try to test drive an A4/5 with this engine and then decide. Never heard of a European Audi dealer which didn't have a 150PS car for a test drive. 
 
The 190PS 2.0 TFSI has the same fuel economy and is all around better. The only drawback is the upfront cost and maybe tax/insurance depending on country. 190PS is enough for every occasion when you don't care about performance. In the city it really does not matter and the 150PS will be fine.

This is a US and car enthusiasts sub and thus want much more horses. But wanting an needing are two different things. "
119," Yeah, I forgot the Arteon for a sec. What the A4 is to the passat the A5 is to the Arteon.

Or in other words MLBevo vs MQB platform. "
120," There are many differences between thos two. The size, weight, the way they are mounted, etc. The 2.0TFSI has more torque. Only peak power is the same. "
121, PS is normed with metric units and hp with imperial units. So basicly they took the way hp is measured and rounded the factors to the closest full metric value. 
122," I did, because they are more similar than a Golf and an A5. "
123, Wasn't disputing that. But if you compare it to the base passat which has roughly the same size and engine power. 
124, The Golf is a very differen't car though and OP isn't after performance. The Audi is more comfortable and yet you feel more connected to the road than in comparable VWs. 
125, If it's fwd the engine has enough power to make the wheels spin when launching moderately hard in wet conditions. So enough for city driving. 
126," I missed the ""new"" part as well. Afaik the 150hp was always the base engine. "
127, The 150hp engine is the normal base engine here in Europe 
128," The 2.0 with 110kw has a smaller turbocharger than the 140kw and 190kw engines. Which generation of A5 sportsback is it? The earlier engines had some problems.

Edit: missed the ""new"". I've driven a Golf and Q2 with this engine. I had no problems with overtaking. The A5 is a bit heavier. I would recomment to testdrive it first. 

Edit 2: Not this exact engine but one with a similar power output... "
129," Tpms turns on with variations in temperarures (with no flat tires seen)

I have this problem. Is there an easy fix or am I better of just ignoring it and check the tire pressure? 

It only happens very rarely. "
130," Golf V 1.4  

I drove far too many miles with it. Sold it when it was still worth something. The car did what it was supposed to do for 4 years. I drive 25k miles a year in my daily driver and that car wasn't built for it, my current one is. "
131," It depends on the which aspect and car we are talking about.

Interior wise it's B8B8.5B9.5B9, only because of the missing buttons, otherwise B9.5 is best.

Exterior wise I need to differentiate between the A4 and A5.

For the A4 its B8B8.5B9.5B9 as well.

For the A5 its B8B9B8.5. It's more difficult for me to decide when it comes to RS models. 

In terms of driving every generation just got better. 

For me the diesel S4 is just the successor of my car and not the old S4.

 #x200B;

So the B8.5 was a huge improvement all around while the B9.5 is a mixed bag. 

 

I kind of want Audi to do something crazy, make an RS5 a similar drivetrain like the R18, the A models with different plug in hybrid solutions and an S4/5 with a modified 5 cylinder from the RS3/TTRS. "
132, A remake with more feathers! 
133," Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Fukushima, Sapporo, Yokohama, Kobe.

Those are the ones I'm pretty sure are Cities.

I know many more, but I'm never know if they are regions or Cities(or both).

I know the names from games like total war and from warships.

Names like Miyazaki, Nagato, Akami, Usa, Oda, Izumo, Kaga, Iwaki, Aki, Kongo, Iwami, Fuji, Ise "
134," And that's why a drivers license is called ""Fhrerschein"" in Germany...... "
135, Even 120mph doesn't feel fast. The only real dead giveaway is that the trucks appear to move very slowly if at all. 
136, Not too different either. As always it might heavily depend on where you are in Germany. 
137, Kneipenkultur gibt es hier definitv noch. 
138," In most modern games on Ultra the 2600X can keep up with the RTX 2070, but not in all. Check the games you want to play. "
139," It depends on what you are doing. 4k gaming, 144Hz gaming, individual games etc. "
140," These systems cause a lot of strain on the battery and starter

Is that really relevant for cars this new? "
141, Depends on driving mode. Usually it goes on again when the car needs the electricity. Other reasons for not engaging auto start/stop could be to reach or keep a certain engine temperature or to properly cool down the turbos. 
142," Those are HEDT CPUs which have a lot more features so the price is somewhat justifyed. 

Still too little to late from Intel. In Novermber those chips will get almost obsolete. "
143," I'm in my mid 20s, never was a obnoxious hotshot tuner, got no wife and kids and yet love my sporty comfy luxurious grey diesel wagon. 

I also love ""old"" and ""outdated"" cars, but hate the ""They dont make 'em like they used to"" Mantra. "
144," 100k miles seems to be nothing to a 3.0TDI. 38mpg seems to be realistic. When I'm driving normally I get 39mpg. Only regular maintenance is sufficient.

One thing to keep in mind is the 3.0TDI can come with the ZF8-Speed because of the high torque, meanwhile the 2.0T and 3.0T get the S-Tronic.

The 3.0T also seems to be very reliable.

I personally wouldn't go for a 3.0T or 2.0T if it isn't at least an S-Model. "
145, Limo/sedans are much more popular in the US. Sportsbacks/wagons/kombis/avants are much more popular in Europe. Which is why the US doesn't get A4 Avants for example and the A3 sedan is rare over here 
146," Over here in Germany only have packages which include some options, but you can spec the car to your liking. So they don't tell you much about the options. 
 
The base price of an b9 a4 was around $33,000 usd. The 'trim' I have started at around $55,000 usd. 
Mine is speced up to almost $80,000 usd and I don't even have adaptive cruise control.



How does that compare to the US trims? "
147," This is a server CPU with 64 cores. 

It's basically more than twice as fast as intels best offering in most workloads. It also supports much more ram, storage etc. 

It's used for example in datacenters. The biggest customers for those chips are Google, Microsoft, Amazon etc. 

They use those chips for their cloud services. 

One simple example is youtube video encoding. When you upload a video to youtube at 4k, youtube will also encode it to 480p, 720p, 1080p etc. This requires a lot of cpu power. Chips like these can be used for this. 

But this is just one of countles things where they are useful. Almost everything related to the internet uses these chips. "
148, Sleeping Beauty 
149," Sleeping Beauty if I'm not mistaken.
It's been a while since I saw it "
150," Display Driver Uninstaller.

It's a tool to completely uninstall your graphics driver and everything related to it. "
151," I also prefer intel

With a budget of 630$ there is almost no reason to get an intel system.

 #x200B;

I would go with components similar to this. If you adjust the components a bit or get them for sale they fit right into you budget. The great thing about this build is that can play games at 1080p60 with no problem and you have a great upgrade path.

152," [https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-19-9-2](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-19-9-2)

This is the link to the current graphics driver. Many features of Geforce experience are also included within the driver.

Make sure to do an ddu prior to installing this dirver. "
153," I made my drivers license in a 2009 1.6tdi manual. 

Great car for beginners. But it's not exciting in any way. "
154, Haven't seen 0.80 in a long time. Lowest around here is 1. 
155," The only car enthusiast in my family was into Golfs and got always the newest one since the original one. Didn't share his enthusiasm and thought his cars were boring, yet my first car was a Golf.....

Gran Turismo 3 really got me into cars. "
156," Nuclear isn't as good as it seems. Storage is a problem for Germany. Besides that the current powerplants would still need to be replaced with newer ones. Gas is quick, easy and a relatively co2 efficient stopgap. I would prefer nuclear over gas as a long-term solution but it's not viable in the short term. Also we are talking about using 20% gas and 80% renewables. If those guys in northern Bavaria would finally allow the high power line to be build we could get there much faster. "
157, We still could get by without coal and nuclear and get there much faster. We would have to ramp up our gas though. 
158, Yep and our government slows the overall process of replacing both down. 
159," That's just wrong. She didn't replace them with coal. Coal was already there. They got replaced by renewables. She also didn't want to close nuclear but had to because it got very unpopular in Germany.
That one really is on the Germans and not Merkel herself.
It's easy to blame her, but do it for the right things. "
160," WTF, No. Still over two times tho.

Source:climatewatchdata "
161," I watched Clannad After Story a month after something similar in my close family. 

I couldn't hold it back anymore. This was the first time I cried and I have never cried this much. 

Today I start crying after just a few seconds of hearing the music. "
162," Battlefield V has one of the best bullet physic / weapon realism. It's just tweaked for gameplay reasons. It does  things like changing the gravity from 9.81 to 12 and being able to see the bullets travel.

Every weapon model is very realistic and the animations are top notch. In BF1 they tweaked a lot when someone showed them small inaccuracies. And again for Gameplay purposes they smoothed everything a lot and made it faster.

BF3, 4 and Hardline had linear bullet speeds with a constant gravitational pull which varied from weapon to weapon. Between 9 to 18

BF1 also took the air resistance into account and BFV made everything more consistent and realistic.

IMO PUBG doesn't have good weapon mechanics. It's not realistic enough to be a selling point for me and it's not tweaked enough for the gameplay to be enjoyable. "
163, Racing Wheel Master Race 
164," I bought mine used from Audi and haven't spend more than 20 bucks on it besides regular services. I probably will spend more on materials but not for working hours for the car before the end of the warranty next year.

The mentality of bigger Audi dealers seems to fix everything under warranty instead of doing it before selling the vehicle. Mostly mild annoyances, things that look janky are likely to break, because of bad treatment by the previous owner or known issues with the car. "
165," Even in the countryside it's all over the place.
I've witnessed strange things. I heard a father telling his children that he doesn't care if his children have a same sex marriages as long as both partners are catholic.... "
166, I often see cats on the street. They mostly belong to the farms around here or one of my neighbors. I don't know anyone in my region who keeps their cat indoor all the time. 
167," The wheels are to much for my taste, too big and too aggressively angled. I like it otherwise, definitely one of the better livery wraps. "
168," Unpopular indeed, though I can understand where you are coming from. "
169," The Rush version sucked balls

IMO the rush version was awesome for 16-24 players. Conquest was just an afterthought "
170, I always thought the Romans watered down their wine for everyday drinking. 
171," I have a Vega LC for over two years now. The card runs perfectly. With an adjusted fan curve it doesn't really get hotter than 65C while running at max powerlimit and a clock rate between 1720 and 1770. The HBM does not get hot either.
The pump is completely silent.
A repast is the only thing I would do to the card.
Couldn't ask for a better RX Vega card. "
172," From my experience:

* xDrive felt sportiest
* quattro gave me the most confidence
* 4motion felt like the opposite of xDrive

The cars I drove were a BMW 4-series, Audi A4/5 and a VW Passat with and without AWD systems.

quattro was another reason I went with Audi. "
173," The car should be able to hit 150mph or 155mph depending on factory trim. 

I just leave it in Auto. The car seems to know what I want most of the time. 

The sport suspension on mine is great for driving fast. High speed stability and comfort were two major factors why I bought an Audi.

 #x200B;

Safe driving is always a must! 

I drive very defensive, adjust to the weather, never let something distract me, never overtake with an excessive speed difference and always respect the speed limit. "
174," I think it's because Android auto streams everything the car and it doesn't have multi screen support. It only forward some information to the car. The map in the VC isn't a 1:1 google map. To avoid confusion Audi doesn't display it. If you got only got a center screen Android auto gets displayed there. Most cars have two screen and Audi choose to stream it to the central screen only. But that's just my guess. 

I switched between Android Auto and Audi navigation many times and there wasn't any difference in travel time. Some roads are not correct though. Googles time estimate seems to be better to a creepy degree, but Audi is just as fast overall. It estimates a lower time than google and it end up taking as long as googles estimate. So basically I check in Google when I will arrive and then use Audis navigation. My only experience is in Germany and Parts of Austria. "
175," That's what one of the lowest CW values in class gets you on the highway.

I also get 37mpg while commuting normally. Seems like we have a similar mix of highway and backroads. I probably drive much faster though. Haven't had a workday on summer tires without hitting 125mph.

Which drive mode do you use? Comfort only? "
176," Edeka

Good selection of products. Always fresh food and local food available. 

Not the cheapest but still reasonably priced. "
177," I knew the US only got a limited selection compared to Germany, but is it really this bad?

 

Besides quattro Audi is also known for their diesel engines. Just look at their LMP1 cars.

And yet there aren't any diesel engine in the US available? 

I could choose between nine engine trims for my car alone. "
178, Is this dice answer to the call of duty head glitches? 
179, Thought the football team as well 
180, Now add the skulls of Dinosuchus and Purussaurus 
181," Yes, but even two door coupes aren't the most mainstream thing to begin with. They just aren't head turners anymore, neither through their design nor through their rarity. "
182," They aren't mainstream. We have a few people who are into these sort of cars.  Comparable smaller offerings from other manufacturers are far more popular. It's the same with American Muscle/Pony Cars. The Mustang seems to become more mainstream thought, especially the ecoboost. "
183, Since I have my new PC I turned up the resolution scale to 200% on a 1440p 144Hz monitor. The game looks unbelievable sharp now and still runs great. 
184," Nay

For me it was the wrong BF at the wrong time.

Too similar in gameplay and setting to BF3 and I didn't like most differences.

Even today I would rather play BF3. Still managed to play hundreds of hours in BF4 though.

BF1 is different enough to make it worth playing for me.

So basically the order I play the games isn't necessarily representative for how great those games are.

Edit: play on PC "
185," So you used the World Banks definition. That one doesn't really fit for Germany. 

Let's take a look at the [German School System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Germany#/media/File:German_School_system.svg).

This graph isn't represantative for all German States but it gives you a rough idea.

We split the secondary in Germany in two. The sec II includes part of  our dual system where you go to a vocational school. This is relatively independent from our main school system,  you don't need abitur in the dual system and could start after year 10 of school. 

After finishing you can go further and get your  ""Meister""(Master of your trade) for example. Those are likely included under tertiary education. "
186," Depends on what you want from a road.

If high speed is you thing there are some great bits of Autobahn where you can floor it. The A33 has nice new bits for example.

Some have nice curves through a beatiful landscape. I can't remember the names. The southern part of the A7 is really curvy but is not in the best condition.

The Nordschleife is a great road to drive. It's classified as a toll road. The surrounding area(Eifel) is also nice. "
187, Someone elso linked my source already. Nowhere in this post is mentioned that these statistic include or vocational training and vocational school. **Your** definition clearly isn't used in this graph. 
188, One guy in my street has a mk IV diesel with over 500k on it. The car is fine but $2200 CAD seems to be far too high. 
189," So you are telling me either Germanies Federal Bureau of Statistic is completely wrong, Eurostat is wrong, those are not included or everything is bs. I go with the third option. "
190, 47.5% of Germans have done a vocational training. Because auf the dual system in Germany this includes going to a trade or vocational school. Add to that the peopld who did go to a trade or vocational school without doing vocational training and you end up above 50%. Some trade school degrees are already included though. 
191, If you include all trade and vocational schools then you could at a solid 50% to Germany. 
192," For me to take tfsi over tdi it needs to be at least an S-Model. 

TBH the B9 3.0 tdi didn't feel like a big downgrade compared to the S5 b8.5 and the tdi has many other advantages. "
193," I would probably take an improved version of my car, so an RS5 maybe.

I could go with the Panamera turbo SE or RS7, but those are too big for European streets imo. "
194," It's a pre production and modified car and the time was probably stopped the same or similar way to the claimed civic type R record.

The time is not as impressive as it seems at first, but I still think tesla will beat the Taycan with a new and improved Model S.

Porsche will probably come back with an improved and lighter version of the Taycan and beat tesla and so the arms race continues.

A great time to be an electric car enthusiast. "
195," Haven't really heard anything negative about the b9 Audis in terms of reliability. Some small issues you get with new launched cars. Like the glue on the winglets failing in hot climate, some bugs in the infotainment, the latches to fold down the rear seat failing etc. Most of it should be fixed or is relatively easy to fix. 

Multiple 100,000km test showed no major issues popping up. 

Is the car fwd or quattro? "
196," Which engine? One of the three 3.0TDI engines, the 2.8 FSI or the 3.0 TFSI.

Usually the 6 cylinder engines from Audi have less problems and 100k miles is nothing for a diesel. "
197," Need more information, but the engine is usually mounted longitudinal in cars with ""real"" quattro including the quattro. 

Side mounted engine cars usually have a complete Haldex system or are fwd. "
198," The US history was almost always tied to European events.

* Colonization(US as a side note) 
* Slave trade
* Independence was taught in context of the build up to the French revolution  
* The civil war was only mentioned in literally one or two sentences  
* Emigration waves from Germany to the US 
* Little involvement at the end of WW1 
* Great depression   
* WWII involvement mostly in Europe We talked more about imperial Japan itself than US pacific war involvement which came down to Pearl Harbour and dropping nuclear bombs.
* US after war involvement in shaping the BRD 
* Cold war, but the Korean and Vietnam war were only side notes   

We also did few lessons where we talked soon to be historic events which happened during our lifetime. 911 and Iraq War were big ones.

The US was also often used as an example in school and thus also US history. Capitalism, patriotism, racism and genocide come to mind. 

I know a whole lot more than I learned is School partially due to US media.

This was in NRW  around 10 years ago. "
199, She may be a bit dirty from the 1000km I drove to get there but she still looks stunning. 
200,  
201," WTF, No.

Certain trim levels can get close, but they are completely different cars. 

The Passat uses the MQB plattform shared with the Golf, A3,TT,Atlas etc.

The A4 is on the MLBevo plattform shared with the A5,6,7,8, Q7, Urus etc.

The engine placement alone makes a difference for example while changing directions. "
202," Thanks, I didn't know this was a thing. I always thought all areas like this were completely dissolved during WWI and WWII.

I'll definitely check it or similar places out when I'm visiting the north east. "
203," As a German I'm jealous of three things regarding the car market.

1. Cheap American Muscle/Pony cars
2. bigger selection of Japanese car models
3. Tuning/Aftermarket "
204," Yep. It's not the base engine because it's a bit more expensive. It does 9.8s from 0-62, but almost 60mpg. "
205, I think this is more due to space. A giant truck would be a pain in the ass over here. So almost no jealousy regarding the car market there. This would probably change if we could use those things and had lower fuel prices. 
206," The european market A4 is the same as the US A4 but the base engine is 150 HP

You can also get a 136hp one......... "
207," Curious German here. What does make this village German, besides this beauty? "
208, Also the Civic didn't use the now standardized timing setup. It could fully accelerate out of the last corner before starting the hot lap. 
209, It kinda was in the Alpha according to many. It got nerved pretty hard since then. 
210, The alcantara sports seats are super comfy. I have the sport suspension and it's also great for long drives. Maybe if you have bad roads where you live it might be to harsh. I commute around 86miles every day. 
211," I did 269kph/167mph the other day. But this was according to the tachometer. Still over the ""limited"" 250kph/155mph per GPS.

Today on my commute I did 237kph/147mph. "
212," I don't know if this qualifies as a personality change but I'm more outgoing and extrovert when I use English. I also make more compliments.

Sometimes I feel like I come across as harsher, blunter, more aggressiv and like I present my views a bit extremer. But those are probably just cultural differences I notice more because they don't sound that natural in English. "
213," Nope, the opposite. They might have looked a lot crazier. We found some with striped feathered tails, black feathers of all different types all over their body like crows, some that looked like parrots, some had bat wings and feathers combined and ceratopsia had long upright standing feathers at the start of their tails. 

There were feathered tyrannosauria living in colder climates which would likely be black and white like Wolves or Polar bears.

Dinosauriers likely were really eye-focused animals like birds, so features for sexual display might have been quite something to behold. "
214," I prefer the Porsche Caiman. They are low to the ground, yet great in wet terrain and they have a mean bite. "
215," Even? Audis are difinetly on the more premium and sporty side, It would be pretty sad if those wouldn't make a difference. "
216," How much is really changed when you put a 230hp family SUV into sport mode?

Quite a bit at high speeds. SUVs get really floaty and sensitive above 90mph. Even slight changes to the suspension and steering can help. 

On country roads those aren't really noticeable most of the time. There mostly the transmission makes the difference. "
217, The cayman is pronounce just like in English....... 
218," In German unlike Porsche the e at the end isn't pronounced.

So something along the line of Ka-yen just like the pepper in German. "
219," I met a Dutch in Austria who lived and learned German there. He ended up slowly speaking Dutch and we German. This way he was easier to understand than many of his Austrian colleagues. 

Met a Swiss-German speaker in France, I gave up.

I'm from North West Germany. "
220," NA isn't really a free market particular if US interests are at stake......
 

Lobbyism is also a thing in both the US and EU. 
 

But let's not get into political discussions in a car thread. "
221, There is a reason why the Jetta has no market share in Europe. The Civic and Corolla are just mediocre cars over here. 
222," You have to look at it per market segment. In the US the Honda civic and Toyota Corolla each outsell the VW Jetta and Golf combined by a factor of three. Korean brands are only slightly ahead of VW. Small cars are still the most popular in Europe. VW is dominant here, but you have a lot choice for this type of vehicle including cars from manufacturers not present in the US. "
223, How did you arrive at that conclusion? 
224," They are also compared to the Japanese and South Korean....

The market which is dominated by Japanese manufacturers in the US is much more competetive in Europe.

We got a lot more lower trim cars with diesel engines. Those have a much better track record than the petrol engine cars you mostly find in the US. Same with transmissions. Manual is the default in Europe and automatic in the US.

One good example are the B8 Audis. The petrol engines had major design issues and were unreliable. The diesels on the other hand ate up miles to no end. Those weren't sold in the US. Earlier automatic transmissions also had many problems especially if you didn't change the oil. The manuals didn't.

Audis are seen are very reliable here in Europe and judging by this US dominated subreddit not so much.

Opposite for Japanese cars. I heard several complaints about Nissans and Toyotas with diesel enignes. It's not as extreme as with Audis, but still. "
225," I think that. They have more usefull feature for me. Nvidias track record in builds i did isn't stellar either.

Nvidia usually has better driver for new hardware releases. Because first impressions matter AMDs reputation is worse. "
226, The sign could use an update. Even the arms on it are wrong compared to the skeleton mount 
227, We had a ts server and at the beginning we tolerated all kinds of players who weren't directly violating our guidelines. When the first woman joined we took it as an opportunity to ban all toxic players for sexism. The atmosphere was so much better afterwards. 
228," In school(NRW) the colonies were mostly discussed in the context of the change in politics after Bismarck. 

""Unser Platz an der Sonne"" 

We didn't really talk about the colonies itself, except the genocide. "
229, 2017 was the first year for the B9 S4. Maybe the US was late to the party again? 
230," Thank you customer for actually reading our terms and conditions. Send us an E-mail with the following content and we will send you a free box of chocolates. 

They did indeed send chocolate. "
231," The Volskwagen Aktien Gesellschaft (VW Group) so VW, Audi, Porsche, Skoda, Seat, Bugatti, Lamborghini, Bentley, Ducati, Scania and MAN. "
232," Yes, but all component are heavily dependent on each other. I would change everything related to the timing chain, before further related problems occur. "
233, I actually like Audis start stop implementation. Easy to control with the break. 
234, Debatable. A french had the idea patented first but couldn't do it. Then a brit could do it but got no funding and then a German did it..... 
235," You aren't dropping out...You finished school and can decide between going to a school for higher education and then university or go to a trade school while also being and trainee, It's a dual system and very popular. You can get a college degree in a certain field afterwards, depending on the trade degree you got.
You aren't a machine...You are trained, skilled and certified personal to for  example operate and maintain the machines. So someone who is highly sought-after. "
236," It's not only about the coefficient, you also have to add the frontal area which makes the I-Pace look even worse. "
237," Here is how you would get a car like this at 18 when you work in a factory. After you finish school in 10th grade you become a paid apprentice for two years and then work almost one year as a full time employee.

You have little to no expenses and work 50h a weeks. That should make it relatively easy save up for a used 20-25k car.

He's still only 18 and has all opportunities and no debt. He could just sell his car if he want to go back to school/university full time (remember those are almost free over here) if he wants to. Buying a expensive car is always a ""poor"" decision.

Telling someone that this car is the nicest one he will ever be able to afford when he's this young and worked his ass off to get it while you know nothing about him is just being an asshole. "
238, Back in 2014 the community here in the EU seemed much nicer. I came back after a few years without playing. Because of all the changes I was a complete noob again. I can't remember meeting so many so toxic players anywhere else. I quit again after a few games. 
239," Signs from M. Night Shyamalan. The home videoed alien scene freaked me out. Every saturday after my mum went to bed I watched stuff like jeepers creepers, saw, Blair witch project and so on, but nothing got close. Horror movies just don't do it for. "
240," 900-1350Km or 8-21h. It all depends on where I'm going and with whom. Driving alone 500km to Bavaria in one sitting and then 500km back in combined 8h isn't a problem. If I drive longer or outside of Germany I make much more stops. It took me 21h to get back from Oslo. I wasn't alone and made many stops, but no driver changes. "
241," You forgot one downside of Germany, modding. It's a pain in the ass to modify your car while maintaining road legality. 

It really depends on what type of car guy you are which country is better. 

I enjoy driving my fast stock wagon on German roads more than I did a Ford Mustang on Californian roads. 

Though I definitely recommend doing latter at least once. "
242," Oil consumption, carbon buildup and timing chain issues. So check the Oil, exhaust gas and pay special attention to the startup sound. If it rattle more than usual it might have problems. You encounter the issues even on dealer serviced cars. No dealer will change the pistons on a car just in case. The chain might be changed on those cars before they could cause any other damage.

I personally would stay away from the non facelift non diesel B8 cars. Look for cars from 2013 onwards. "
243," Both my VW Golf mk5 1.4 and my Audi A4 3.0tdi averaged 6.7l/100km (35mpg).

I mostly drove on the Autobahn and on country roads. The A4 is much much faster at the same fuel consumption. 130km/h vs 180km/h cruising speed. "
244," The biggest difference is size. So how much do you need?

Only the A5 offers real quattro. The TT has a haldex system. "
245, My archive is a giant mess of multiple 100Gb of short captures. Never had the time to properly sort them or even name them. If I want to find the few minutes of third person BF3 gameplay I need to search for hours. 
246, Thanks for the awesome trip down memory lane 
247, Next time I wash my car I will post something. 150km of fast driving every day makes even this color look dirty. 
248, At first glance it looks just like mine 
249, No only 9 km/h. Having a different number in front somehow make me feel anxious. 
250," 69 km/h Nice...

Driving 81 while only 70 is allowed..

I generally use Auto mode over efficiency. It's almost as fuel efficient and a better to drive.

On my 140km of daily commute I average around 6.7l/100km with an average speed above 100km/h.

The car can display more information above the rpm dial. You have to go to the right menu via the button on your steering wheel and set it up there. This is were I always display my fuel economy. "
251," Cycling. We(Mnsterland) are to Germany what the Netherlands is to Europe. We even use the similar word for bicycles ""Fietse"" or ""Leeze"" if you are in Mnster. Bikes outnumber people by 50%. There are also festivals for biking. 

While on a school trip to Munich the tour guide proudly told us how many bikers were around and that we should be careful. We were confused. Bike traffic in Munich makes up around 17% meanwhile in Mnster it's 39%. 

Inb4 the Dutch claim their want their stolen bikes back, you should have picked them up at the [Mnster central station](https://fahrradstadt.ms/2018/01/29/fahrradparken-am-hauptbahnhof-in-muenster-eine-bestandsaufnahme/). "
252, ....and Weser-Ems not Weser-Ams 
253," Center. American plates look horrible on Audis, Euro plates look much better, but having the option to have none at all is even better. "
254," They complained how bad it is for a few hours, saw it is an international survey, talked about how the others should be more like Germany and then answered with good... "
255," While fishing with friends in Sweden we met a group of people canoeing. They asked us how to get around the hydro plant and which route to take afterwards.

We gave them a detailed description and told them for example where dangerous rocks are. Then a friend asked me in German for a specific English word and they started laughing. Turns out they were from the same region. "
256," WTF. I had a 07 mk5 1.4 and have changed the timing chain with the regular maintenance at 120k km. I paid 180....

The car is still running perfectly 80k km later. I don't own it anymore though. "
257," My attainable dream car is an Audi S5. I looked at cars with the intend of buying for over a year. Everything had to be perfect, but of course it never was. 

Buying new wasn't an option because it was out of my budget as I have an aversion against financing and leasing. 

So I let dreams be dreams and saved a lot of money especially in terms of running cost and bought an A4 3.0TDI Avant instead. 

I love the car without getting anxious over every imperfection. Maybe in a few years I will get my true dream car. "
258, A shitty old Golf will outperform even most more modern non German cars. I've never been scared in a Golf driving at its top speed. 
259, Audis or VW in general are either hit or miss in terms of reliability. Some models are great some are awful. The worst offenders are probably all the direct injection petrol engines you can find in pre 2013 cars. Meanwhile 100k miles on a TDI in the same car is nothing. 
260," Was mich noch mehr berrascht hat ist, wie geringe die Bereitwiligkeit war die Sprache zu lernen. 

Ich kann verstehen warum man schlecht English spricht wenn man nur schlechten Unterricht in der Schule hatte, aber es nicht ansatzweise fr ntig halten?  

Der Unterschied war schon echt krass. Und die Noten hatten natrlich auch nichts mit den realen Kenntnissen zu tun. Whrend einige volle Punkte bekommen haben obwohl sie nicht mal die gelernten Vokabeln richtig in einem Satz benutzen konnten, wollte unsere Lehrerin mir nach langen Diskussionen auf Englisch nicht meine bersetzungen anerkennen, weil wir sie ja nicht so gelernt hatten. Ihre bersetzungen waren total realittsfern und die Hauptsprache in meinem Berufsalltag war Englisch.... "

That's why...... "
265, My dad had 240k miles on his A4 B4 before it was stolen. Almost everything on the car was original. My neighbor has 125k on his A4 B9. With the right transmission engine combination you can easily go over 200k. 
266, Even Matrix LED headlights? 
267, Cries in the country with most expensive electricity (that isn't a small island) 
268," Diesel is at \~$4,95/gallon. That's one reason why I drive a diesel. Might have bought an S4/5 if that wasn't the case. "
269," Well, I'm really close to the dutch border and they have the highest E5 prices in europe atm. "
270," Probably in another more expensive part of Germany. The prices can differ vastly from region to region and time of day.

In the Netherlands and Scandinavia the fuel prices are even higher. "
271, Cries in $6/gallon. 
272, I would argue that the competition in this market segment is much higher in Europe than in the US and the reliability isn't outstanding enough to be a huge selling point. 
273," I can only have experience with the 3.0TDI engines. My neighbor didn't have any issues at all besides a cracked windshield. His is from 2016 and has 125k miles on it. 

On mine only the left latch for folding down the rear seats broke. The car in now at 60k miles. On the inside everything looks, feels and smells like new in both cars. 

Just the regular services were done.

So far I have only driven the 440i. The Audi isn't as fun to drive, but not far behind and for me wins out in almost everything else. 

As a daily I would definitely rather have the A4. "
274, Which features does it have? 
275, It seems to be the other way around here. A friend got a fully equipped new A5 when he brought his Passat in. I guess they want to give you a taste of a more expensive car in the hope of selling one to you later. 
276, Are those especially rare? I think I saw some when I drove down to Bavaria. Those are definitely blink and you will miss them cars. 
277," Habe ich auch gemacht aber als FISI. Bin jetzt aber schon ein paar Jahre Vollzeit im Beruf.

Im vergleich zum Studium ist das Niveau in der Berufsschule extrem gesunken.

279, Is there something like the best gearbox? Doesn't that depend on vehicle and use case? 
280, I thought they represent the two highest engine trim levels. How does that represent the worst thing in the automotive world? Other companies sell those sporty badges without any relation to the actual sportyness of the car. 
281, I thought this primarily affected cars with TFSI gasoline engines build between 2008 and 2015 
282, Where are most of the cars you sell produced? Generally speaking I hear a lot less complaining over here where most cars come from the Wolfsburg factory. 
283,"  #x200B;

Do you know if the wastes policies are the same throughout the country?

It slightly differs from region to region how the exactly the household trash disposal is organised.

I think in most reagions you have at least three bins/containers at home. 

I don't know many exact details but there are probably many federal laws.

You said that thrash tracking comes up sometimes but was there any protests regarding this in Germany?

I don't think so. The topic seems to take a back seat to the Coal phase out, diesel NOx emissions, air travel, too much nitrate in our soil and water, too many antibiotics for farm animals, microplastic in our water, plastic in the oceans and plastic in general. There is kind of an out of sight out of mind mentality around the export of plastic, though. "
284," We recycle a lot of our waste. 

 Where I live we differentiate between four color coded types which will be picked up. 

Yellow - Plastic 

Blue - Paper 

Brown - Biowaste

Black - The rest(smaller Items) 

 

Then there are recycling container for glass of different kinds. 

For other stuff you there a companies which will dispose of the waste for you.

We probably the world champions when it comes to trash sorting. 

We recycle almost all of our trash. Well in theory. 

Plastic is a completely different story. A lot plastic is converted into energy(up to 53%), another huge part of plastic is exported to Asia with the false hope of it being environmentally friendly recycled and the actual amount of reused material is more like 18%.  

International trash tracking comes up as a topic from time to time because of it. There wouldn't be a change in our daily lives if we would increase our recycling rate. 

Another problem is that we are one of the biggest waste producers per capita. "
285, Where have you been? There is definitly a bigger gap between European countries than the states in the US. 
286, Also bei uns in NRW ging es bis 1990. Das war so um 2010. 
287, Bavaria is the Texas of Germany in almost every way. In terms of GDP this would make NRW the California. Cologne as the media capital would be LA. This feels sort of wrong though. 
288," Kind of. While travelling I noticed cars etc not being as nice in south western Europe as here in Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia. But I thought they just don't care about stuff like this and enjoyed better food, expensive wine and so on instead.

My Grandma always told me that living in a rich country meant to have a lot choice in terms of food, living in a poor country, referring to eastern Europe and Germany right after WWII, meant only having something to eat and living in a third world country in Africa meant having nothing to eat. This lead me to believe France and Italy were really rich. "
289," Sennheiser HD6XX for $220 are great open back headphones, but at this point onboard audio isn't good enough. Add a dac from Schiit or so for $130 later. With a modmic you get one of the best and durable audio setups for $400 or less. Not recommended for bassheads though. "

292," It was more like stereotypical than I expected, when I first exited the airport. But that was in Florida.....   

California and New York mostly matched my expectations. There is a lot of truth to the stereotypes but you shouldn't take them at face value.

297," Here in Germany depreciation is not as bad as lets say BMWs, Mercedes or Skoda. So its wasn't really something I was concerned about when I shopped for my car. 
How do I plan to deal with it depretiation?
I don't. I just assume the car is worth nothing after my first drive and just enjoy the car more. "
298, And thats why Matrix LED exists..... 
299," Mine also had one, but it was small diesel manual. It also had over 250k before it was stolen. Almost everything was original,  even the clutch. "
300, You can see this power degradation on the Autobahn. The top speed drops by over 35mph and at some point they have problems accelerating when they try to overtake a truck. It's not only the batterie which causes problems. 
301, Mine is a B9 Audi A4 Avant 3.0tdi. It also looks and feels like it came out of the factory a few weeks ago....... 
302, Here in Germany the natural habitat of a diesel is in a wagon on the left lane doing 130mph. The trashing you are talking about is mostly done with gasoline engines because tax and insurance cost generally outweigh the fuel consumption if you don't drive more than 15k. 
303, Then most diesels aren't build for that. Not the performances fault though. Diesels simply aren't as exciting and aren't great for doing short fast trips. I really wanted to see the R8 diesel or a supercar version of the R18. 
304," Diesel engines aren't really made for fast driving

Depends what driving fast means to you. Constantly driving 130+ mph or accelerating from 55 to 130+mph is no problem for a Diesel. 

They are also more efficient under constant load. 

It only comes down to gearing and power.

The fastest non hybrid car in Le Mans is still the Peugeot 908 HDI FAP with 700hp and a top speed of over 217mph. Audi was also planing to make a diesel R8(road car) which would have been fastest R8 at that time. "
305," I think an E200d would pass emissions tests, but nobody in the US wants an expensive sub 150hp diesel when fuel is cheap. "
306," There is little difference in power between a Veyron and late 80s Group C car in qualifying trim. I think it all comes down to power to weight and aerodynamics. Group C easily wins the former and the Veyron should win the latter. The Bugatti Veyron could probably hit 400.

Also the tarmac quality on the straight was worse than on todays and on the VW test track. "
307," Yes, I did. Even though most of my dreams are based in a fantasy world, they need to be authentic.

 Saying that the blower style cooler on the AMD reference cards is shit and causes overheating on models like the R9 290, Vega and now the 5700XT, to say their stock voltages are to high and their early GCN drivers were bad is true. Most things can be avoided by buying partner cards, which is frustrating because they always launch later.

Nvidia also has an extensive track record of cards dying due to bad design, bad drivers (in one case they were so bad that they literally killed your GPU), overheating, looking at you 480, and so on. "

335," I graduated around the same time. Every classroom had a chalkboard, some had old overhead projectors and 2 or had normal projectors, those were always booked. Till 2011 only 3.6% of pupils had access to a computer in school at once. No WiFi, no cellphone reception. The first computers I used in school still had Windows 95. That was in 2005. During class any kind of electronic devices besides calculators were banned, some teachers ignored it though. During brake nobody gave a fuck. My school was notorious for having really old equipment. But hey, at least you could find racist (biology)books older than WWII in our library and the equipment for our science classes was excitingly dangerous.

My brothers school meanwhile had at least normal projector in every class. And some classes were paperless. everybody just used laptops.

Why the stark contrast? My theory is that the school never got any funding because it was always above average when it came to grades and so on, my brothers was the exact opposite. "
336," Yes, but they are very rare and shy.

340, Not necessarily but it really helps. 
341," In certain cases like BFV the RX Vega 64 is better than the 2070. 

But in the games you mentioned Nvidia is better. Over here in Germany you can find really good models for the same price as the RTX 2060s, so 'reasonably' priced. 

I like the feature of AMD driver more than Nvidias. 

AMD always sold less GPUs than Nvidia independent of value. The market share of Vega is pretty small but its still growing so at least some are buying it.

Here on PCMR many have Vega cards in their flair. Mostly Vega 56 though, because that card is awesome value. "
342, Sapphire 
343," The pixel density of 2k on 32"" would be far too low for my taste. I would recommend to aim a least for 1440p. In that case relatively good VA panels should start at around $350. "
344, My water cooled one got 7229 in Superposition 4k while drawing up to \~375W 
345," Yes, but I have to be in the mood for it, 

just like a good wine. "
346," If you have really annoying neighbors more than just old people care.

really pointless to call the police

It depends. If you clearly annoy the police more than others you it's pointless. But if you really frequently have problems with your neighbor, the source of the noise can be taken away(sound system, gardening tools etc.) they can get a 5000 fine and you can get a rent reduction from your landlord. "
347," Sonntagsruhe(Sunday), Mittagsruhe(noon) and Nachtruhe(night). The enforcement depends on the state. I think Bavaria has the strictest rules. "
348," In Germany, it depends on the school.

It depends on state even more. 

Where are you from?

In NRW we started learning English in 3rd grade, but I think today many schools even start in 1st grade.

In 6th grade we started learning a second one. Most of the time you could choose French or one alternative language. In Gymnasium it's mostly Latin. In 9th grade you could choose a third one. After that it depends mostly on School staff. We could also learn Dutch, Spanish, Russian, old Greek and probably some I forgot. "
349, But have you actually checked the color setting in the driver for the monitor? The drivers might choose a different profile due to your monitor and this could cause problems. It's just a guess. I'm not at home and thus can't try to reproduce the bug. 
350," Thanks. That's definitely one I haven't seen before. Have you checked the HDR settings in game, windows and the AMD settings? "
351, What are you talking about? I know many player with AMD systems including me and this is the first time I heard about this. Maybe its something related to your settings? 
352," It seems like it's platform depended and on PC hard/software dependend. 

I have a full AMD system and performance was never better. I also have many bugs like the stutter I get when I kill someone with a tank, but nowhere near as many as people here complain about. "
353," To clarify, I agreed with your choice of motherboards, I disagreed with you saying that all AM4 Asus boards have bad vrm. "
354, That's for b450 and does not apply for x370/470. If you want to get good vrms on an asus board you have to get a more expensive one. Asus sucks  at price/vrm performance 
355," Asus VRM's kind of suck on their boards.

They don't. Asus has both bad and good VRMs.

But MSI has usually the best VRM for the money.  MSI b450 Tomahawk or Gaming Pro Carbon  Asus Prime X470-pro Strix b450-F "
356, That was the plan when I bought mine. 
357," If you want to be really really pedantic: There are 6Gb versions. But not on a normal retail GTX 970 video card.

GM204 allows for 6Gb, for more you have to go to GM200. So no GTX970 with 8Gb. "
358," 1ms response time

That's usually the pixel response time of a tn panel. The Monitor itself has also lag.

Which monitor do you have?

How many fps do you get ingame? "
359," Diesel has 25% more energy per liter than gasoline. The difference from all cars above is a lot higher than the 25%. 

The thermal efficiency of modern car diesel engines is \~43% while petrol engines can hit \~38%. There are diesel engines with more than 55% thermal efficiency.

Diesel is also cheaper here in Germany. Petrol costs \~1.4 per liter(\~$6 per gallon) and diesel \~1.2 per liter(\~$5.20 per gallon).

You save a lot of money. There is a reason why diesels are so popular over here. "
360, Ask again in 10 days when Zen2 is released 
361," You need an external DAC and AMP. A USB headset has an external DAC and AMP so it should resolve this issue.

If you already have a relatively good headphones i would suggest to just buy an external DAC and connect your headphones to it. "
362," The funny thing is that BFV is sponsored by Nvidia, meanwhile AC Odyssee is sponsored by AMD. "
363, In DX11 pre-rendered frames is basically enabled by default in other games than BFV without a possibility to turn it off. 
364," $200 includes the headphones. Just go down from an i7 to an r5 for a dac and you don't need to think about it for a decade.
You can also always get it independent of your PC. 
I just think more people should consider it and it's good value for more people than you think. "
365," Or you could have bought Sennheiser HD580 back in 1993 and still have really good headphones today, depending on how you treat them of course. Due to interface changes you maybe would have changed your DAC once or twice in the same time. If you would have spend $100 10 years ago you would still have a good solution today and in the years to come. Sure you don't need it just like you don't need an i7.

Some of those guys are by no means audiophiles. They just listened to what the audiophiles got on LAN-Parties and decided the small investment is worth it. You don't need go overboard. Even a $200 investment gets you a lot. "
366, Or you can get a new RX570 for $120 including Division 2 and World War Z and you can play all games at 1080p. The card is twice as fast and has twice the VRAM. Even used the value of the 1050 is bad. 
367, It's not as uncommon as you think. Everyone I know has good headphone and audio solution independent of their rig. A good audio solution is a much better long term investment than higher end components. 
368, If you don't get a really good deal on that PC avoid the 1050. It's horribly overpriced and 2Gb isn't really enough anymore for modern games on 1080p. 
369," Also do a disk cleanup. Windows accumulates a lot of junk on C through updates etc.

rightclick on C-Disk Cleanup-Systemfiles-mark the biggest ones-ok "
370," I'm planning to replace my current 1700X with a 3900X. My board is an Asus Strix X370-F. I know my 32Gb 3200 CL14 can clock higher so I will try to hit 3600. 

The main goal is to always get above 100fps in the games I play most. In theory the 3600 would be enough. 

But I like to do all sort of things, so it wouldn't be difficult to put all 12 cores to good use. 

Besides that every time I upgraded the thread count increased, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16 and now hopefully 24. Without more threads it doesn't feel like an upgrade to me. "
371, Around 175 000 normal people per hour 
372," It's the same over here, we just don't have a general speed limit on four or more lane road with a barrier in the middle. If this criteria isn't met the limit is 100kph. "
373," It's really dangerous and there are a lot of accidents

When it comes to highway accidents the Autobahn is in the upper third of the EU.

This is quite remarkable considering the high traffic density. It's also a lot safer than country roads. 

Could it be safer? Yes. But there are a lot of other more effective measures to make our roads safer. "
374," I have a friend who also has trouble pronouncing the ""th"". He uses ""z"", ""f"", ""w"" and ""d"" instead. Ze pronounciation can change multiple times wifin a sentence like dis one. "
375," No, we have ""Geschwister"".

Google translator shows ""enfant de mmes parents"" as a direct translation.

So I wondered if somebody actually used something like it. 

I've only heard or read ""mes frres et surs"" before. "
376," Do people sometime use something like ""the children of my parents""? "
377," Nuclear Power.

 #x200B;

While I'm not on the circlejerk level that most of reddit seems to be at, I'm in favor of keeping our nuclear powerplants a bit longer and phasing coal out first. 

In 2011 nobody seemed to share my opinion here in Germany. "
378, But not with guys like the one filming not pulling completely to the left 
379," I'm a bit defensive, because there is a big discrepancy between the perception of the relations in said survey and I think the US and Germany as the two biggest western economies should be working more closely together, but there seems to be no effort in this direction at the moment. "
380," According to surveys Germans question the friendship with the US much more. 

Many Germans trust the US government as much as they trust Russia. 

 

There are many good reasons for that. 

Spying on the government, human rights violations, the trade war, pulling away from the Paris agreement etc. "
381," If I remember it was something related to the turbocharger. But this time it wasn't the turbocharger itself.

Something between the turbocharger and intercooler broke so the engine didn't have enough air to generate power. "
382," Not really any specific ones.

As a rule of thumb I always with the stock on ryzen 5 except I do higher OCs  

then I go directly for bigger air coolers from be quiet or Noctua (NH-D15). 

 

I thinks it's best if you try the stock cooler first. You can always upgrade later. "
383," If you aren't going for a high OC, there is no point in getting an AIO. They also aren't as effective at that size.

Get a normal air cooler instead or use the cooler which comes with the cpu. "
384," As always it depends on what you want to do. For normal 60Hz gaming there is no need to upgrade your cpu.

If you are after those really high fps Zen2 might be worth a look. "
385, Both only work in certain hz ranges. Due to the validation process the range is typically wider on Gsync. 
386," It can have higher energy density per volume and already has per mass
 
It's not nearly as temperature dependent as EV's. 
 
Batteries use more rare-earths and other scarce materials. 
 
Today hydrogen still has a lot of problems regarding production and storage. It has a lot more development potential which is why hydrogen could be the future. Simply dismissing it now is also stupid.
 
EVs however are already here. "
387," Both systems have their advantages and disadvantages. 

 

There are many reasons why Japan committed to hydrogen and some big manufacturers showed interest in it again. "
388, Any specific recomendations? 
389," I really don't want to live where you or most people of this thread do. 

 

Around here everybody seems to be much more concerned about accidentally being hit by a car because of the darkness. "
390," He still got part of the money because the threat was regarded as unjust treatment, but I don't think the case belongs in this thread. "
391," Are you talking about Gfgen?

He was threatened with torture and not actually tortured.

He argued that the threat of torture itself is also torture, which the ECHR ruled against.

We actually hold a trial as an exercise about the case in school. "
392," I kinda fell for the current hype this time.

 

But in hindsight nothing about the improvements I got couldn't be explained by the nature of windows feature updates and a complete gpu driver update with ddu. 

Hopefully we will get some big improvement next month. "
393," I'm the opposite. 

 

I'm usually the squad leader because I'm the best at keeping track where my squad mates are and set squad orders so we get the points even if our current main objective is a different one. But I'm horrible at setting squad reinforcements, so usually at the end of a round a squad mate get to use the V1 and is in the best squad scene at the front. "
394," What is it about the political questions that ruin your day? Are they condescending toward you? Is it the frequency? Or are political question a really touchy subject in general?  

 

I like discussing politics with foreigners, but don't want to offend someone. "
395," Doch!

There are many reasons why German is considered a harsher beside stupid WWII movies. 
German is very popular for dog commands for example. 
But even normally spoken high German is harsher than many natives realize. "
396, We didn't ban Scientology. We just made it hard for them to do stuff. 
397," Yes, but I would check the oil and tire pressure at the first gas station. 

 

I drive 100 miles everyday, I would be really anxious if I wouldn't think my car could do more than 1k miles. "
398, Without 
399," Well, It was designed and build near Cologne Germany. Last time I checked the UK and Germany are parts of Europe. "
400, Still no Peugeots for the US till 2023. 
401, The US doesn't get any Peugeots until 2023 and Doug doesn't seem to make Eurotrips. So I highly doubt he will review the car ever. Which is a shame because they are really quirky cars. 
402," Would go to euro meets with you car from a European brand which was produced outside of Europe?

They don't have any brands which originated there. The cars which are produced there didn't have their origin there. 

Vladivostok is also a hub for importing Japanese cars. "
403, A friend of mine got a fully trimmed A5 and A4 when they had to fix his dirty diesel Passat. Nice upgrade. 
404, Not anymore. Today it's more commonly used for Audis. VAG sends their regards. 
405, The 2004 Tsunami was a definitely big thing here in Germany. I would think it has gotten a lot more attention than for example the Haiti earthquake. 
406," I wouldn't use curved dual monitors. 

I think a ultra wide monitor is much better. "
407," Both device will be good for what you do.

I think the decision boils down to your way of taking notes and writing.

If you write a lot and I mean a lot on the keyboard then the Laptop is better.

But if you can make use of the pen for taking notes and sketching drafts the Pro is the device to get.

The moment I got my pro 4 paper became obsolete. The screen is just about big enough for coding in VS. "
408," I play either on a 4k OLED TV or a 1440p 144hz ips monitor. 

If you tweak the settings the RX Vega 64 can play games on 4k just fine. 

In many cases 4k is not worth it over 1440p 90+fps on a 144Hz freesync monitor though.

I wouldn't bother with a cheap 4k monitor. You get a monitor for the picture quality and there is more to it than just resolution and framerate. 

If my TV only had 1080p60 I still would probably still game on it over my 1440p monitor, but the input lag with almost 20ms and burn in stop me from playing all games on it. "
409," In the last week of its warranty a RX480 Nitro broke down in one of the PCs I had build. Got a RX580 Nitro+ back. 

 

The vendor didn't want to replace it, so I contacted Sapphire.

I send the card to them and a week late got the RX580 back, most likely a refurbished model. It had small scratches on the cooler but the one I send them had bigger ones. 

I'm a happy Sapphire costumer for a decade now. "
410, Do you know what happened to IBMs GaAs chip development? 
411," Yes they are terrible at OpenGL, but the Vega 56 is not much worse than a 1070. "
412,"  It's called Allroad because it's made for all road surfaces not for offroading.

 

In Sweden for example there are many unpaved roads in the countryside and you can get a lot of snow in the long winter. You don't need a full Offroad vehicle, but I also wouldn't drive my new A6 there.  I think something like an Allroad is a good trade off. "
413," Bad rapping in and otherwise solid non rap song.

That makes me flinch every time. "
414, Delidding is very effective on those CPUs. So if you really want to minimize your temps that's the way to go. 
415, HBCC activated? 
416," A beefier cooler doesn't help that much with the type of heating issues the 7700k has. 

The CPU is not soldered and thus doesn't transfer heat as fast. "
417, Without an OC that cooler is a complete overkill. It's as good if not better than 240mm AIOs. 
418," Audi kinda loses to both of those esp on styling and interior.

In the last year I've driven a lot of new Audis and BMWs and Audi is far ahead when it comes to interiors. 

They feel nicer, are more ergonomic and some features are just better, the virtual cockpit for example.

The exceptions are the plastic shifting paddles. The over reliance on touch screens in the newest A6/7 is also a turn off for many.

Styling is really subjective. "
419," It's not just this subreddit. Over here in Germany I know many people who prefer the looks of them over the saloon. The rears of Audis, Mercs and so on just look weird to me especially the newer models. "
420, Then 500w is fine 
421," It's pretty good, that's why I also bought it. But it's not a complete overkill like other boards.

The 16 Core ES also ran at 1.572v. A high OC for me is one you only do for benchmarking or short workloads. 

1.4v without sub ambient should be possible imo. A bit over a month to find out. "
422," It should give you at least some Idea on what a CPU is able to take. In the same way we can assume the final CPU will probably be able to hit 4.25Ghz.

The final product should be better, but still be able to be pushed to those extremes power and voltage wise, though not in the same relation. "
423," Sry, my phrasing wasn't great. I was talking about his specific board(Asus Strix X370-F) not X370 in general.

Zen+ limit is not 1.4V, even if you want to run it 24/7, though I wouldn't be comfortable with that either.

I was basing my assumptions on the leaked 16 Core chip which ran at 1.428V while using 248W and wasn't chilled, and some 7nm experiences with Radeon 7. "
424," Depends on your definition of high. We don't know how much power they will consume. But I wouldn't do the equivalent of going beyond 4Ghz on my CPU on the 3900X. 

So above 1.425V is definitely a no go zone for me. "
425," What are your other components? 

 

500W Bronze for a RX vega 56 is completely fine, if your other component don't use much power. "
426," The RAM stability is the biggest unknown for X370 boards. 

That board itself should be fine even for the 3900X if you don't plan on getting a getting a high OC. "
427," My 1700 does 3.975 @ 1.30v.  I can use the stock cooler

Congrats on your golden sample "
428, Probably one of the Call of Duty games 
429," The only Italians I know visit Italy less and less. 

They own restaurants in Italy and Germany and they say the situation is sad,

simple things don't work, because nobody wants to make it work.

 

Also considering everything else I hear about Italy it makes sense. "
430," I'm tired of 'mainstream' music in general. 

 

I also like music where I can't understand the lyrics and I also really like music with no lyrics at all. 

Sometimes understanding the lyrics helps to elevate the music to a new level and sometimes I wish I would not understand them. "
431," I can't say I mastered the language, but there are a few notable moments.

 #x200B;

When I realized I suck at English the same way I suck at German. 

When I just stopped giving a fuck. 

When I attended a course for a B2 certificate. I immediately decided to skip the course and directly do the exam. 

When I came back from a business trip and had to adjust to German again. "
432," Just what I thought. The player count does seem to be lower in NA than in for example Europe.

Others like levelcap also appear to complain a lot. "
433, Which reagion? 
434," Generally speaking yes. There are apps/programs which actually make you computer faster by deleting a lot of junk which accumulates over time or tweak some settings which makes the computer seem faster.

But a lot of programms don't do that or do a bad job at it and damage you device/OS. 

If you want to make your device faster, just do a factory reset, install the necessary drivers and only stuff you really need. "
435, But they are more expensive and weren't around when Zen1 launched. An upgrade from the I7 2600 or earlier to a R5 is completely reasonable. 
436," It is not only about  who caused the accident, It's also about the severity. You worsen the damage when you drive to fast and you are made responsible for that. "
437," Ich kenne leute die sehr stark in der CDU involviert sind und bekomme somit am Stammtisch so einiges mit. 

 

Es gibt Leute in der Parteispitze die total Realittsfern sind und bestimmte Sachen mit einer Selbstverstndlichkeit von sich geben bei denen man sich nur an den Kopf packen kann. Es hilft nicht das diese Personen sich mit Gleichgesinnten umzingeln(echo chamber). Beispiel Anja Karliczek. 

 

Andere hingegen sind nahe zum Burnout und werden von z.B. Aktivisten in den Wahnsinn getrieben, so dass man mit Ihnen schon fast richtig Mitleid bekommt. Beispiel Christina Schulze Fcking.

 

Viele in der Spitze fhlen sich antagonisiert und nehmen die Kritik auch deshalb nicht ernst. 

Es gibt auch noch gute junge Leute in der CDU aber auch sie werden nicht ernst genommen. 

Selbst viele Parteimitglieder haben bei Fridays for Future mit gemacht und diesmal nicht CDU gewhlt. 

 

Die CDU zerstrt sich grade selbst und bekommt es nicht mit oder will es nicht mitbekommen. "
438," While It's not ""supported"" from AMD there should be no problems actually running windows 8.1 with one of those CPU's. "
439," Actually yes. One of my online gaming friends is a Russian-German born in Kazakhstan. He spend most of his life in Germany, but still has family in Kazakhstan. 

He doesn't understand English, but is fluent in Russian. For me it's interesting to talk to someone who is completely removed from the anglosphere.

 

I have never been to Kazakhstan myself. "
440, And AMD is holding back their 16core part. 
441, My point was renewables are sustainable. It's supposed to have a sarcastic undertone. 
442," You can invest as much as you want in hydroelectric power, but It wouldn't change anything. We simply don't have the capacity. 

 

Renewables have the best long term sustainability. Fission power plants runs on a fuel which would run out way before our sun dies. Fusion would be a different story though, but we aren't there yet. 

 

Our power grid isn't fucked up by renewables itself. Current estimates are that our power grid would be completely stable at 80% renewables. "
443," AfD - nazis  
  
NPD - dumb nazis

I thought It the other way around. 

AfD - dumb Nazis who don't want to admit it

NPD - violent Nazis 

 

(you have to be really dumb to be a Nazi anyway) "
444," Yes, I own a car. I live in a more rural area, but you could still get by without one, It just would be a pain in the ass.

Besides that I simply like driving.

I hate city driving though and avoid it as much as possible. 

When I was living in a city I didn't have a car. 

Cars should be a luxury item and not the default way to get around. I'm completely in favor of more bike lanes and public transportation. "
445," Broadly speaking I agree. I think German is great for the type of music Rammstein makes, which is part of their success. English, Russian, Italian, Spanish and French would feel out of place, which Rammstein know and take advantage of. "
446," I strongly agree with the second part. People always argue about taste. But I don't get the feeling that anybody is really upset. 

I really like Rammstein and a friend hates them. We always argue. 

I really hate Schlager and a friend really likes it. We always argue. 

Nobody is upset. I think it helps to understand each other better. "
447," Maybe the chewing gum thing is known, because I heard it a few times. "
448," The British heavily bombed the area. During that time my (great) grandparents had to hide in a nearby cave or a bunker just like everyone else.

During the war there were 2100 air raid alarms.  

  

During the last days of the war the Volkssturm decided to make their last stand in/close to the village I grew up in. The village itself wasn't something special but it was easier to defend then the town behind, which was valuable. 

  

Nonetheless the British were seen as the liberators in 1945 by the civilians, partly because the Volkssturm wasn't comprised of any locals. 

When they arrived the Volkssturm destroyed all the bridges and took a stand in the nearby hills. The Tommies arrived with some 400 Artillerie pieces and besieged the Volkssturm. 

Then they attacked under heavy losses during easter 1945.  

 

There are still a lot of undiffused bombs and grenades around here. Some farmers can't even be bothered to report them. "
449," A typical German... complaining about our government all day long but when forced to take a step back or talking to someone not German saying it is ""OK"".

They/we are not wrong though.... "
450," North of Munich does seem to be a hot spot, at least that's what I noticed the few time I was there, though I doubt it's as bad as you make it seem. "
451," The main reason I usually do something like this is simple. Gear ration and peak engine performance. If I need to overtake a tractor for example downshifting makes sense, but I don't get much more performance out of my car when I downshift trying to overtake a truck. Engine power output flatlines slightly above 3000rpm and the normal gear at that speed is already close enough. No real need to downshift.
Also you are trying to accelerate and thus basically automatically Rev matching. "
452, Does this include creeping forward in slow traffic downhill or rolling the last few meters without breaking? If yes I broke the law when I was in CA. 
453," While slowing down I stay in gear and try to shift as little as possible, meaning I slow down till almost idle rpm and than schift in neutral for a complete stop or to the corresponding gear. 

I try to drive as smooth as possible, but usually don't rev match. Some examples where I do include downshifting for going up a steep mointain or when I make a fast turn.

My 120k mile clutch still feels like a 10k one.

Almost everyone I now doesn't rev match, but tries to drive/shift as smooth as possible.

That's taught in driving school here in Germany. "
454, Where do you live? Never heard It's illegal 
455, Based on this statement and your username I assume you are talking about Germany. 
456," I encounter people from all over the world due to my work. I regularly talk to Americans and Canadians via phone/Skype etc. 

Some of them live in Berlin where we also have offices. 

Never really encountered Mexicans while I was in Germany. But It's hard to tell because I don't really know how a mexican english accent sounds. They might as well be from any other spanish speaking country.

 

I live in a more rural part, so I don't encounter many foreigners on the street, maybe some Dutch. "
457," I have/had absence seizures.

My parents got me tested by multiple doctors. But they found nothing and thought I just daydreamed a lot, which I also did. 

In school I had a lot of absence seizures. Teachers got mad at me for ignoring them and daydream instead. 

But then after I finished school I had a bad seizure which broke my back, twice. 

Then we knew what was going on. I have Grand Mal Epilepsie and the trigger for my absence seizures is being tired. I was always tired when I was in school but never when I was tested. "
458, Don't forget the friendly banter with the Dutch about which country is better in statistic X. 
459," It was hard for me to learn in school. I suck at learning language the way we do it in school, this includes my mother tongue (German).

Then I discovered the internet and from that moment on learning the language somehow just happened.

The differences between spelling and pronunciation are annoying. For the most part I just stopped giving a fuck.

My skills improve by just reading and hearing enough until it feels right. "
460, It does push PC hardware to its limits though 
461," First of all their size.

The concept of sharing one big pizza is somehow strange to me. 

When it comes to taste it's all over the place. There seems to be much more variety in all forms good or bad. 

I prefer the classic more simple Italian pizzas. 

On average the US overdoes it when it comes to food, too much, too sweet, too fatty etc. 

But you got plenty of choice.

Most of my experience is from California. Got only very little experience in Florida and NYC. "
462, Why? Paddles are basically just convenient to use buttons. I never really got why they are not used in many more cars. 
463," On the left lane you have those Germans thinking that driving 220 km/h is an expression of freedom.  
  
 I really hope that we finally get a general speedlimit on the Autobahn.

They introduced a daytime speed limit on part of my commute. With the speeding mentality it didn't help. Those guys are still annoying AF. Maybe even more so, because they are always only a bit faster than me while overtaking and force me to brake behind a truck much more often. It doesn't even really matter how fast you go, they are always 5-10 km/h faster, will always overtake you and always have someone with the same mentality behind them.

Only introducing a speed limit isn't enough.

I wish they would remove it. 

Sry for my small rant. "
464," We already have too many stray cats. Aoshima is ridiculous. If you want to keep mice/rat population low cats don't seem to be that effective. They are better at killing birds.

475, There are also some Irish towns which share a name with German once like Munster. 
476," This. 

In my school we never really had students who caused major problems, were violet and so on.

We had peaceful student organized protest against things our school did, which was seen as bad behavior by authoritarian teachers.

We had edge lords who did Nazi salutes just to be edgy. Those guys were actually quite the opposite of Nazis. They still got in a lot of trouble because of it. 

 

The school my brother went to was the opposite. Crimes, constant fights, drugs, actual Nazis who carved swastikas into things where guest workers stayed etc. 

Nobody wanted to send their kid to that school but because it was a 'rural' area they often had no choice. "
477, You mean Elsa Lothringen!

490," Georgia is on my bucket list of places to visit.

495," The European mindset would be to get an economical car with less horsepower and spend all the money somewhere else. Fuel is much more expensive and you could get a lot for it. Hence the many smaller engined ""luxury"" cars over here.  "
496," Here in Germany the ""Abwrackprmie"" seemed to have worked reasonably well. So I didn't thought much about hearing it for the first time. But it really hurt when I read more about C4C.  "
497," American cars (in general) are no where near as stable at speeds in excess of 100mph as German cars, because they're not built to be that way. 
 
While this has been true to a degree there are still many non-German cars on the Autobahn and they don't seem to cause any issues. 

 "
498," Building a new stretch is a pure nightmare and takes ages especially because of the high population density. 
 
Germany is also a federal republic with 16 States and many things are handled on a state level as well. 
 
Still I do not think a Autobahn in the US would be realistic simply because of scale. Americans need their cars to get around, for Germans cars are luxury.

504," I don't watch much anime and when I do its subbed. Some of the more recent dubs seem to be good from some snippets I've heard. I only come across dubbed ones on Netflix and Amazon. Set your VPN to Germany and browse Netflix for a bit. 

I would avoid the cliche 2000s anime, as their dubs are heavily made for a young audience. Thus many things are Germanized and don't really fit in. I would also avoid dubs for anime which are close to the Japanese culture even when they are not Germanized. 

Not recommended for learning German.

Most dubs done by the same three voice actors. 

Although those three voice actors probably produced better dubs than most English ones. But they are strange because they do things like use the Japanese -sensei,-kun, etc. in combination with a German pronunciation of the Romaji names. For example Sasuke from Naruto has a pronounced u. 

 

I've watched Cowboy Bebop in German, English and Japanese on Netflix and all dubs are great. 

Not an anime(?) but Avatar was great.

The Studio Ghibli movies also have great dubs. 

 

Those also use proper German which is actually used. If you ignore the setting specifics that is.

518," Disappointed: I recently had a BMW X5 M50d. It basically was everything I expected from a BMW, but not from a diesel. It felt like they just put a powerful diesel engine in there and changed nothing else. The transmission is not suited for it. It's almost impossible to put the torque of the diesel engine to any use. It would always immediately upshift. Also the fake sound is horrible. BMW just made a horrible attempt to hide it is a diesel. Why not embrace it instead?

Impressed: Coming from mainly BMWs I expected Audis like the A5/S5 similar or slightly better comfort and quality. I was surprised how much better it was. The B8 facelift A5/S5 interiors look really outdated on pics but irl they don't feel and look that outdated. "

532," Usually a VW Golf is the typical beginners car. I got one, many of my friends have one. We are only slightly older than you. It is the perfect beginners car here in Germany. We all had your Budget. In the first year I drove 32500km in mine. All the Opels had bigger problems over the years. Most of them startet around 100k km, especially 3 cylinder cars. I don't know about the used car situation in Sweden.

A friend of mine collects old Volvos and we often drive to Sweden.

The cars are cheap, reliable and easy to repair, but they use a lot of fuel.

I've also seen many older Mercedes beater cars in Sweden, those would probably fit in your Budget, but I can't really say much about running costs.

Usually I would recommend a small diesel for you commuter distance, but you will run into problems in the Swedish winters if you don't park your car in a garage. Got first hand experience on that one. "
533, I would advice against cheap Opels build after 2000. Also make sure you get a four cylinder engine as they are more reliable if you make a lot of km. 
534," I think its also due to aerodynamics. There isn't a big difference till you reach 130km/h, but after that many get louder than their German counterparts. Guess it also affect handling. "

Almost everyone I know has driven their car at speeds higher than 112mph just to test it. Almost everyone I know has done over 112mph in driving school. It's a thing you do every now and then, but if you want to get somewhere its not economical.

544," Had to look that one up. If you are in the Netherlands and parts of Germany, I think most would understand you. It doesn't sound too different from people here speaking fast bad english while being drunk. "
545," In Germany the culture is definitely more similar to their neighbors. It has more to do with our history than the actual proximity to the border.

The Dutch border is around 40km away. Crossing the border for shopping, working, partying aso is more common the closer you get to the border. The difference between Germany and the Netherlands isn't big enough for anything ""special"". "
546," The Netherlands, Its only a 30min drive, followed by Sweden or Denmark if driving through it counts.  "

560," Both. But usually I'm a visual thinker. 

 

Your question was in English so I thought about it in English. If you would have asked in German I would have thought about it in German. 

It usually depends on the topic I'm thinking about which language is more prevalent. 

In my head it doesn't matter how I use the languages.

The big problem is speaking in a different language about a topic than you are used to.  "
561, Happy Cake Day! I work in the IT at an international company. I'm sitting between West Germany and our European headquarters. Germany likes laws and regulations and has a big economy. I think your German skills can be put to good use in your field in one way or another.

568," Highways in Europe have 70MPH(110KM/H) speed limit during winter and 80MPH(130KM/H) speed limit during summer.

In which country? I can drive 130mph in the winter which is only limited by my tires. Road conditions are a different topic.  

The numbers you have are typical speed limits for different countries not different seasons. "
569," Germany has a very strict annual safety inspection 

The first inspection of a vehicle has to be done after four years and then every other year.  

 

Many things I've seen in the US would land you in trouble in Germany. Just like driving at Autobahn speeds in the US would. "
570," If that would be the case, I wouldn't want to drive in most of the EU. When it comes to death per driven km Germany is in the lower third.

That being said, you need to change your driving style on the Autobahn a bit compared to most other highway system. "

576, Piss and weed. 
577," I learned the basics in school, but didn't put any effort into it. Then I discovered the internet. I became fluent in understanding and writing it. My writing skills are bad, but that has nothing to do with the language itself. I only started speaking it fluently in college. Almost all my courses were in English. I don't have a specific accent. Americans can just tell I'm not a native speaker, but they can't tell where my accent comes from. "
578," Yes. I usually start with the most familiar first, but end up playing as a minor more obscure faction I like the most.

If the game has ancient rome in it,  its always rome first, If not then anything related to where I live. "
579, Where have you been in Europe?  
580," Roughly 4% of Scandinavians, Dutch and Germans own a caravan. So my guess would be that roughly 10% did such a road trip. "
581, I think you are wrong. Many people with caravans or campers do road trips. They usually don't stay at one place or country.  
582," It's not about top/average speed, how good the cars are. It's about acceleration mostly. In my experience those guys may buy good cars but with the cheapest engines in them, get stuck behind trucks on the Autobahn and never know how and when to overtake. Then they complain how stressful it is to drive. 
 
Just a general tip. You don't tailgate a truck like I always see. Just fall back a little, look for a gap and accelerate on your lane accordingly to 130. Don't just wait till a gap on the left is big enough for you to directly pull over at 90km/h and then accelerate. "
583,"    
I'm completely with you on that one. I like driving thats why I drive this much. But someone to whom it is just a mode of transportation it should not be the best option. I rather take public transportation into the city than driving into it for example, because there it is just a mode of transportation for me. 
  
1,3 ton-vehicle

You whish. 2+ton SUVs are getting more and more popular.
 "
584, It's probably because they try to change the status quo and there aren't really any non emotional arguments for no speed-limit. 
585," Solution for what? 

My opinion as someone who drives over 100km on the Autobahn everyday in cars ranging from an old 75hp Golf to a 400hp BMW is that a general speed limit is not necessary.  

There are some bits I travel frequently where they introduced a speed limit of 120km/h from 6 to 19.

It didn't had any positive effect. As many traffic jams and accident as before. The severity of those didn't change either. There still are as many noticeable bad drivers and assholes as before. I still have to brake as frequent as before. My fuel consumption didn't go down compared to driving at Richtgeschwindigkeit before. 

 

I don't think driving with a speed limit is more relaxing. 

You have to do the same things anyway. Don't use a speed limit as an excuse to not be aware of your surroundings. 

  

I see no point in introducing one. Let the ones who want to drive fast, drive fast on bits which allow it. 

 

If you really want to lower accidents and traffic jams, introduce dynamic speed limits/signs.  

If you want to help the environment, make driving fast more expensive and invest that money to make more environmentally friendly modes of travel more affordable. 

 

A general speed limit is more of a cheap out imo. "
586," Same. Most people I know who are strongly for a speed limit rarely actually drive on the Autobahn, live in a city or drive a slow car.

It doesn't seem to have anything to do with generation.  "
587, You can match a 2080. I speak from experience. My card averages ~1700MHz in BFV and 1100MHz on mem. 
588," It's crazy I can play BFV at almost 2080 Ti performance with my overclocked V64

With 2080 performance not 2080ti. Or do you run Liquid Nitrogen? "
589," It offers everything I want/need.

I'm a driver and usually only smaller people are sitting in the back of my car. So the headroom is enough. I would be fine with a bigger Coup but those rear doors are really handy. Nobody needs to move if someone in the back wants to exit the car. The ease of access to the cargo with folded seats and through the bigger tailgate is just a must have for me. But I do not need the additional cargospace a station wagon would offer.
So it sacrifices everything I don't need on a station wagon, for a look I love.  "
590," I always thought that word is used for money in general and not for the Euro in particular? Similar to the German slang words '*Ocken/cken' and 'Kies'*  

  

But I'm not dutch "
591, I usually do that for around 2h before and after sleeping. Except if I have to get up for work. 
592," On this level everything is a generalization. 

Its the point of Jens Bttiger or my interpretation of the point, not necessarily my opinion.

I've been to the US and I've seen seemingly desperate veterans selling flags and other stuff outside of a Walmart.

You simply wont see stuff like this in Germany. I've also seen plenty of unselfish acts by Americans for other Americans.

The difference being that they are not that well reflected on a legislative and political level. We Germans are mostly exposed to this outwardly proclaimed patriotism. This plus our history and how we are labeled by others leads to our smugness especially to Americans about stuff like this. 

  

Also, nationalism sucks. We all live on the same grain of sand. There is nothing more important.

Completely agree "
593," I don't think anybody was disputing that. I came across that article while searching for a new psu a while ago. Temperature fluctuation and load difference will offset those results. 

 My reasoning was this: 

more consistent 80Cfrequent heating to 80C and then fast cooling it down to ambient again.

Or 
 
Slow temperature changes fast ones  "
594," How many people are begging to get into Germany? Not many

  

 Thats just wrong.

According to the UN Germany is migration destination number two in the world, behind the US. When you take the population of both countries into account its the same.  "
595," The German word for 'Patriotismus' is synonymes with 'Vaterlandsliebe', which simply means to love your country.  

  

As you can see in your English definition the way a person expresses his love is the main difference. 

The point is, that Americans tend to outwardly proclaim that their support for their country while Germans do other unselfish acts to support Germany and Germans. The Former is seen as an more nationalistic thing. "
596," They are orderly  

Not when it comes to queing up for something

 #x200B; "
597," So do we in Germany and sometimes you even have to pay for them. So does almost every country I've been to. 

I think how many things are broken differs though. "
598," We Germans like to complain.

When it comes to such things we tend to have the attitude that everything here is bad but everywhere else its worse. "
599, WTF happened to you? Living in the city is expensive still not over 50% of a household income payed in rent expensive. On the country side its much cheaper. If you can't afford it don't move into a big city.  
600," Get up at 6:40  

Drive to work at 7:10 

Work from 8 to 16:30  

Back home at 17:15 

Do the mundane living stuff 

Play video games with friends from 19:15 till 21:00 

Watch Netflix and co till 22:00

Sleep.  

Repeat for 5 days a week. 

 

ps: I need to stop browsing reddit in my car and start driving home. "
601," The last time I had one it was the newest one(2018) with not even 2k miles on it. One week later it had 5k.

I think you most likely get one from the newest generation, so 6th generation facelift model. They were introduced in 2017.

At least judging by their parking lot. Haven't seen an older one. That was in California.

That means no V6. So either an 2.3 EcoBoost inline 4 or an 5.0 TI-VCT. Because you don't know I bet you'll get an EcoBoost. On the plus side it has more torque and better fuel consumption than the V6. "
602," The longer wheelbase of the 4Gen subaru legacy of 2,670 mm in comparison to Miata's \~2300 mm certainly helped you there.  

 #x200B;

 #x200B; "
603," Dream Car: Dauer 962 LM or any other road legal group C car.

  

Attainable: Audi S5 SB. I'm about to buy one. "
604," Is a miata that unstable at high speeds? My shitty old Golf topped out at 120 and was completely stable at that speed.

 #x200B; "
605," Germany should be slightly above 50k and France almost at 45k.

Same with for example California which is above 55k. "
606," I never had this many issues with either of them. However my friends, who always ask me when they have any, did. Didn't matter if it was an Nvidia or AMD card. Be careful which model you buy and make sure you can rma them, because most cards which fail will do that in the first few weeks. You can change the target temperature in the overclocking menu. If you do not like zero rpm modes, don't buy an Asus Strix model. They have the worst implementation of this feature, at least on their 1080 Strix. 
  "
607," edit; An analogy to what you said would be arguing that my car's engine was designed to run over 6000rpm, so I should keep it there.

A car engine is a great analogy but not how you think it is. Your car engine is designed to stay at a certain temperature independent from your rpm or engine load. Big temperature changes are much more dangerous for the longevity than components running a constant 80C. "
608, The summer and 3 weeks in the winter in Scandinavia then a few weeks in fall and winter somewhere warm by my standards and the rest back home in Germany. 
609, You have to leave at all to be the last one leaving. 
610," One could say the same about Nvidia. Broader speaking nothing you mentioned is an AMD only issue. The specifics might be different.

Never a GPU again?

and last but not least, anyone else notice the fan's on their cards don't turn on until they reach 60C? That's a stock setting almost designed to cook your card. the gpu die can probably handle it, but what about everything else?

It's a feature and completely harmless.  "
611," The Germans would be the first to arrive exactly on time and the last to leave. They would stand in a corner drinking keeping to Themselves , sometimes chatting with someone they know. Until they get drunk. Then they awkwardly party and are 'best friends' with everyone. "
612, I benched at the Launch of BFV to check if everything is running like expected. In Timespy I got 8614( GPU 8545; CPU 9032). In Fire Strike I got 19662(Graphics 27236; Physics 19931; Combined 6331). 
613, Thats not it. I get perfect memory scaling in firestrike and timespy till 1180Mhz. In theory I can push 1200Mhz without artifacting or crashes but the score will be lower. What scores do you get in FireStrike and Timespy? 
614, My GPU runs at \~1700 Mhz in game and HBM at 1100........ 
615," I did that too

 #x200B; "
616," Same. I started with everything on low, tested dx11 and 12, future frame rendering and so on. The increase the settings I deemed more important until I felt a difference in performance.

Still my CPU remains the noticeable bottleneck in 64 player conquest which is game mode I almost exclusively play.

Which performance capturing tool did you use? I used the in engine one and amd performance overlay.  "
617, How did you do that? I've tested every setting in BFV extensively as it's the game I play the most. Even with the CPU and RAM clocks and timings in my flair I'm not able to achieve that. 
618," To be fair their test suit for games was biased towards Nvidia.

But not overall 9% biased. "
619," My question now is: can anybody tell me how many fps I can get with ""high"" settings in BFV? My monitor can do 144Hz, so I try to get 120 if possible, with the best looks possible.

With Balanced settings without noticable impact on visual quality, that's definetly possible with RX Vega 64.

You CPU will be you Bottleneck and you will get lows below 90fps.  "
620," I get 120+ FPS at all times in BFV with Vega 64 and 1600X at 1440p.

No you don't. At least not in anything with 32 player. or more You CPU will bottleneck hard. Or does it run far above 4GHz? "
621, The UK for example has the same birth rate as the US. France a higher one and Germany a lower one. The EU only a slightly lower one. But all including the US are below 2 children per Woman. So almost every traditionally western country gave up on the future. What's your point? 
622," Having loans scares the shit out of me.

Never had any and hopefully never will.

I'm currently saving up for a nice car the old school way. 

Every time I see someone younger than me driving an expensive car I ask myself who is the owner. The parents? The bank? "
623," On paper I'm a native German and B2 in English.

I suck at speaking in both equally or not depending on your viewpoint. 

I use both everyday. I'm at a point where I don't even realize which one I just used.

Because I suck at most things language related besides understanding, I can't motivate myself to learn another one.

 I can understand some Dutch and low German, but not at a meaningful degree.  "
624," Not exactly. Generally B2 means that you can hold a fluent and spontaneous conversation with a native speaker without great effort.

However B2 certification isn't a realistic indicator for this.  "
625, I have a Sapphire branded HD5870 engineering sample used in one of those showcase PCs. Only been in use for 8 Years. Can I have 300$ now?  
626," If you order an ordinary VW in Germany, you have the option to get a tour through the factory in Wolfsburg and pick up your car, which only rolled from the factory into the parking tower. So overall not even 0.125 miles. Double that if  you let it deliver to your local dealer. "
627," In theory yes. The states are still working on changes and the federal ""Medienstaatsvertrag"" can not be changed till 2020. 
Until then nobody give a shit except someone reports you, which is a dick move. A Streamer Lizenz will cost around 100 and they are basically just there because its a law and has to be enforced somehow. "
628," Still has nothing to do with freedom of expression, though. In that regards nothing changes.  

  

One could say that Germany and France want to copyright strike Youtube itself. "
629," Yes. Check your sources. I'm German and I frequently tune into livesteams on youtube, be it German or international ones. "
630," The difference between the German twitch and the UK porn laws for example is, that the German laws predate the internet and the UK porn laws were made with the internet in mind. Article 11 for was already about to be implemented in Germany under national laws but was deemed unconstitutional. 

Germany is an overregulated bureaucratic nightmare and is not able to react fast enough to things like the internet, is overprotective towards copyrightholder, has strict laws against unconstitutional behavior and is backwards when it comes to technical implementations. Many things are still this way because of the conservative party(CDU) being in government for the last 14 Years.  

 

The UKs government tried to censor the internet because they deemed content as immoral/indecent. 

 

That's why the UK is on the list of enemies of the internet from reporter without borders and Germany is not. "
631, Don't underestimate the scientific illiteracy of the masses. 
632," Which level would the us be if treated like any other country? 

Level 2? Increased caution due to high gun violence, harassment and arbitrary enforcement of local law?

or even level 3?  "
633," Same in Germany.  

If you aren't breaking any other laws you are usually just told to go somewhere else. 

If the police is involved there can be a fine of anywhere from 5 to 80. Or 500 if you behave like a complete a-hole.

 

I have never seen anyone actually paying a fine for just sleeping. Littering, loud noise or open fire on the other hand. "
634," Not counting my own and countries I've only driven through. Sorted by the number of visits:  

The Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, France, Norway, Austria, Belgium, Hungary, Poland and Portugal.  

So overall 10 "
635, You forgot the most important one! Murcedes 
636," No family reasons. I could move tomorrow. Got friends currently working in the US. 
 
There are many other reasons why. 
 

I probably wouldn't be able to find work in my current position in the US. I'm in my mid 20's and by far the youngest. The average age of my colleagues all over the world is double that, which seems typical.

I know that I  wouldn't downshift and work myself to death or don't work at all. Both of which would be unhealthy. 
 
I don't like the work environment.
 
Health reasons. Insurance companies don't like me. 
 
But most importantly I like it here in Germany. 
I like the region I'm responsible for. I like driving up to Scandinavia, the Netherlands or down into the alps. I like the people more for everyday life. 
  
  
I wouldn't be able to stand the outgoing and smalltalk nature of most Americans for more than a month or two. I wouldn't fit in that well. It's great on vacations on the other hand. 
  
 Two of my friends also are happy to move back to Germany after a year abroad. (Florida and Washington DC). I think it would be the same in my case. 

 

 "
637," Something like  Carbiketrain/bus

At least in North West Germany. "
638, I'm German and have three. I use just one and don't know where the other two came from. I guess I'm Nordic too. 
639, Can confirm. Work in IT. Earn much and have good benefits but my American colleague salary is absurd. Even more so after tax. I still wouldn't move to the US. Looking forward to my next vacation to the US this year though.  
640, They already did now its just a little bit easier  
641, I thought we already had Norway for that  
642," Europeans don't consider North America to be a continent

That's new to me. Where did you find those idiots? "
643, I know some who pay their rent by cash because they had to file for bankruptcy. 
644," Are your 95k in miles or Km? Because roughly 95,000 Km was when the problems of my moms car started. "
645, Was it a mexican VW? 
646," Couldn't agree more. This is why I drove my mothers Opel only twice. I hated every second of it.

They also Fall apart after 60k miles even if they are well maintained.

 #x200B; "
647," I had luck with the 15ft one and bad luck with the 30ft one.

Length does play a role. "
648," This applies to low/mid tier boards (b450, cheap X470). 

On the high end Asus and Gigabyte have good features combined with good VRMs. 

 #x200B; "
649," Apparently by working in Germany. I seen so many poles working here in the west.

You guys are driving like suicidal maniacs but do a good job in my experience.  "
650," Switches are just ""dumb"" hubs connecting various devices, as far as I know...

It's the other way around. Switches know which device is on which port and hub's basically just broadcast.

The latency added by a switch isn't noticeable. Get a proper Gigabit switch and you are fine. Gaming switches are bs. "
651," I mainly play fps.  

  

Mouse: Logitech(G402 wireless) best form, best sensors, best wireless technology, good value and good quality.

 

Keyboard: Got a Logitech one. Isn't really anything special, but I don't need anything special. 

 

Headphone's: Sennheiser. They might not have the most accurate sound curve on their mid tier, but their Headphones deliver very clear sound. This makes it easy to hear everything around you. "
652," Germany should implement speed limits

Not that unpopular.

 traffic lights to the far side of the street

I guess most just never thought about it.

#  "
653," I'm only sometimes myself.
I make many characters and often slip into their shoes.  "
654," Yep, this aspect indeed reminded me of Berlin, when I was in NYC. 

 

Berlin is also quite different from the rest of Germany, thats probably one reason why I noticed the difference instantly. "
655, They are a complete joke. That's their point. Their votes on subjects are quite similar to Die Grnen and Die Piraten. 
656, I did this all the time. Now I don't because it had a seizure after 10h of daydreaming... 
657," I've been to three different states.

 #x200B;

First I was in Florida. I was surprised how clich everything was. Overly friendly and loud people were, Lawyer billboards everywhere, everything was bigger, Walmart people, that people had either totally white teeth or none at all, how divided the country is, how 'casual' everyone was dressed, how boringly planned everything  was(straight roads for example), US Flags everywhere, and so on. I saw a billboard on the highway which read 'The NRA is a terrorist Organisation' and a few meters behind it was one advertising guns. 

 #x200B;

Then I was in California. It felt much more like over here than in Florida. It was much more diverse in every sense. The gap between rich and poor was really big and in SF there were so many homeless people. 

 

And then NYC.  How poor and rich everything was at the same time. Many things were badly maintained, but it almost seemed like this was celebrated. How other cultures displayed as something special.(in a hipster sense). And the typical NYC versus European city stuff, like many skyscrapers and so on.

 #x200B;

But one thing I wasn't expecting and really hate was the chlorinated tab water everywhere. "
658," The card performs like mine in Firestrike. The only benchmarks where mine performs that bad in GTAV and FFXV, which are kinda broken. "
659, Oh my mistake. I just looked at my old [benchmark](https://imgur.com/ssNSlQt) and am very disappointed now..  
660, Faster than I expected. Especially if you consider that those benchmark heavily favor NVidia GPUs. 
661, Rarely. Most of the time I develop characters who can be the ultimate bad asses in certain situations.  
662," I'm really apathetic in rl. But the characters I created get to me.

I'm not emotionally close to anyone I regularly talk to, maybe that's a way of coping with it with emotional solitude.  "
663," Yes it takes forever. I pulled all-nighters. I got seizures, because of it.
 
 Usually it takes a bit over an hour for me to sleep. One trick I use to sleep is dreaming about relaxing situations I experience through the eyes of my characters.  "
664," Same but with ADD. Turns out I have vivid imagination and school was just boring for me. They considered to put me higher grade but didn't because I already was the youngest. So I kept on dreaming in school. I never learned to put any effort into something, which came back hard in college.  Forward a few years and it also turns out I have grand mal epilepsy, which only shows when I'm tired like I usually was at school/college. "
665," Yep, I'm the weird German and always meet the well traveled Dutch. Bar in the middle of nowhere? If I'm there, there is also a Dutch....  "
666, Similar story here. 37.5% after tax returns...ouch 
667, und Falls doch mal berholt werden sollte bitte auf Richtgeschwindigkeit beschleunigen 
668," Ofcourse It's both. Music, Movies, news and so on.   "
669, You would be suprised how many many of us can name. US-media has a big influenz over here. 
670, That's a country 
671, Old county would be more accurate. 
672," Alsace-Lorraine

That's part of France now. If you use it in context of Germany its called Elsa-Lothringen. "
673," I'm in my mid 20s. Heard the term only a bit over a year ago. Heard something like this was a thing 15 years ago, when being tested for add. "
674, A lot of bad things happen to my characters. That makes them more interesting. So I agree with the title. 
675," Longest distance with toilet stops and refueling was roughly 1300km from North west Germany to Oslo.

 #x200B;

Longest traveling time with toilet stops and refueling was from  Bordeaux to North-West Germany. 1250Km in 22h. It was a huge mistake driving via Paris during rush hour. 

 

Longest non-Stop trip was from North-West Germany to Munich 700Km in 5h. "
676," I can lucid dream, I think. The major difference for me between LD and DD is that in LD I'm always a character/myself and in DD I can choose not to be and the sensations in LD are bit more intense, touch for example. While DD your actual body is always kinda there but while LD your body is completely in your dream.

 

It doesn't help irl. It only deepens escapism imo.  "
677," I think once you are an adult you realize how childish it was trying to be an adult.

You need to stop or cut down your daydreaming because/if it's detrimental to your (mental) health not because you think it's childish.
 "
678, Don't forget to also stresstest your CPU for maximum heat output. 
679," 99% full of Gouda  
  
Every time I go to France I bring back a load of cheese and ration it

That's true and I do the same, but its still much easier to find good cheese. 

In California and New York I could find some but price don't compare, even adjusted for those states. In Florida I didn't search enough. 

In California and Florida I wasn't exactly in big metropolitan areas except SF. "
680," Pretty much any high quality cheese, depending on my mood.

 

I missed good cheese so much when I was in the US. Most cheese over there are disgusting. I searched for an eternity and paid a fortune for cheese which would be consider normal in most of Europe. "
681," I don't experience something like this. When I'm really focused the day dreams seem to write them self, just like actual dreams. Sometimes something strange happens and I take the active control back. "
682," I felt this way in the past, but got over it. I know my dreams will never come true, maybe for the better. I'm happy that I can dream them. IRL I'm also finally in a good place and don't have the urge to escape into my dreams like I did for so many years.  Now I kinda feel bad who doesn't have the ability to DD this intense.  Next goal is to share those dreams. I just have no idea how. (Im a really bad writer for example)  

 

I'm hoping you can overcome your psychiatric issues and find joy in both. "
683, I definetly suggest driving from Yosemite over the tioga rd to mono lake and then to death valley. 
684," I like it cold. I like temperatures from -20 to 20C if its dry and sunny. Up to -25 and 25C is also Ok.

Between 16 and 22 is ok with almost every weather. 

Highest temperature I experienced outside was 50C and lowest -28C.

I usually only wear thin but wind resistant clothes when its cold. 

In the summers I usually drive to Scandinavia. Last year the weather got me there as well..

685," I build almost all PCs for my gaming friends. 

Sapphire was my got to for builds in the last 10 years:   

HD5870, still running after 9 Years  

HD6950, still running after 8 Years  

HD7970, Dead after 5 Years(I overclocked it to death) 

HD7950, Still running after 7 Years   

HD7870, Still running after 6 Years  

HD7850, Still running after 5 Years  

R9 390, random death after 3 Years    

RX480, still running after 2 Years  

RX480, random death a day before hitting 2 years  

RX580, still running after 3 Month, rma replacement for dead RX480  

RX Vega 64, still running after 1 year

RX Vega 56, still running after 1 year  

 

The cards where pretty much in continues use either by them or younger brothers, cousins aso.

Awesome track record if you consider that almost all cards run with a pretty high OC.  

I never had any QC issues. That's why I was stunned by threads like this and hope the quality didn't drop. 

 

After running into a few problems on Asus, had the exact same issue as op on a 1080 strix, and MSI NVIDIA cards, I switched to EVGA

 My short EVGA track record:

GTX 1080 TI, still running after 8 Month

GTX 1080 TI, dead after 2 Month  

 Not really saying much. 

 #x200B;

 #x200B; "
686," Europe is pretty diverse and you can't generalize like that. The EU has great costumer protection laws, but how they are implemented is very different. Many countries had similar or stricter laws in place.   
  
 
I have worked with/instructed service desks for many different countries. There are key differences between countries. Italy and France for example need native speakers and a more personal feel, while Germans generally don't care as long as shit gets done.  "
687, I'm from Germany.... Even EA has a pretty good customer support here.  
688," I had a different experience. 

I rma'd a card on the last day of the warranty. The shop refused to take it back because the card would arrive two days later (Sunday in between). I contacted Sapphire one day later showing that I contacted the shop within the period of warranty. After I mailed them the RX480, they send a refurbished RX580 back.   

There were big difference between my and your case though. The GPU was dead without a doubt and I had clear information from the etailer.

Did you show them when you bought the card? They can't pinpoint the end warranty. Maybe someone saw the number of the card and that it was shipped to a retailer way before you got the card and then closed the ticked. Sapphire usually only does rma if the shop refuses it. So maybe if you make the situation with the retailer more clear they will help. 

  

Its still really unprofessional of them to make you go through all of this, especially with that lack of communication on their part.  "
689, It's not that rare. I've seen it happen more often than not when traffic comes to a complete stop. Or a most will at least save some space in front of them in the case they need to pull over. Polish drivers are the worst in my experience. I think they just started to be much stricter. I don't doubt that on average the execution in Austria is better though. 
690, TBF Australia and the US are really big and less densely populated. Thus public transportation is not that widely available. Cars are necessary to get around in many places.  
691," Not my PC, but the PC of a friend.  

Someone spilled almost a whole bottle of beer into the PC. Every component was wet. 

I managed to clean the PC and get it running again. Only one RAM dimm was dead.  

  

I blew up my own PSUs, one while overclocking and another one which was set to 120V instead of 230V.  "
692," Sapphire is my go to. Best looking, highest quality cards. They are a bit more expensive but totally worth it. I'm a happy customer for 10 years now. I rma'd a card on the last day the warranty expired. The shop refused to take it back because the card would arrive two days later. I contacted Sapphire one day later and after I mailed them the RX480, I got a refurbished RX580 back.(only slight scratches on the cooler, similar to the ones the RX480 had).

On the AMD side I would advice against cheaper gigabyte models and all AMD ASUS models because they basically only slap NVIDIA coolers on AMD cards, unlike their old AREZ cards for example. XFX should have the best warranty on AMDs side.

For NVIDIA I would probably go with EVGA, even though they fucked up in the past(GTX 1080 thermal pads for example). But they handled it well. Their product also are high quality.

ASUS and MSi are also good options for team green. But ASUS fans did have problems on a GTX1080 ROG STRIX i put into a build. "
693," I don't know. I've only experienced this in west Germany, but I'm also from the west.  "
694, The dx12 implementation in BF1 is broken. Use dx11 instead. 
695, Do you use DX12? 
696, Any specific reason? 
697," The older generation does it sometimes, but very rarely.

Mostly in the context of food aso.

Something like this: What 3 for something? Back in the day it did cost only 0.5 Mark. Thats like 25 euro cents "
698, The EU has really spoiled us 
699, The Xbox One X would be a good fit for Cap. he moved the hammer a bit and there are some games were 4k 60fps on X is possible.

And also

 #x200B; "
702," Because the 1060 3Gb is much faster otherwise. It also gets confused with the 1060 6Gb a lot. 

At that price point of an 1050ti you are much better of with a RX570, anyway. "
703," around 1070 performance levels

1070ti not 1070 "
704," The RX 570 is \~80% faster than the 1050ti at the same price. The RX580 is also quiet a bit faster than the 1060 3Gb at the same price. Also 8Gb vs 3 or 4Gb. AMD is a no brainer in this price segment. If you can find a GTX 1060 6Gb for cheap its also a good pick.

 

In gaming the Ryzen 5s are slower but also better value and I think a better fit for the gpu mentioned. Except if you want to get closer to 144fps in cpu heavy games and are willing to turn down settings. Then the i7 is the better choice. "
705, Downgrade/sidegrade your cpu to a newer one. Get a RX570. It has almost twice the performance for the same price. Get a SSD. Try to squeeze faster 16Gb in there. 
706, That's what good headphones sometimes do to me. If I can hear every instrument clearly I just have to imagine them being play right around me. 
707," Better overclocking and in game performance overlay are some neat features on AMDs side for example.

AMDs control panel looks better, but its performance is a bit more sluggish.

 #x200B;

 #x200B; "
708, Doesn't mean Its a bad product. It's most likely a limited production run due to better than expected yields on the MI50. The Card might be competitive at its price point in a niche market. Besides that the card isn't even released yet. 
709, Please elaborate 
710," Depends on the game and Setup.

 

I have a 1440p 144Hz ips Monitor which I use for most games.

Right next to me I have an 4K OLED TV with a low latency. I use that for couch gaming, with a controller in titles like Witcher 3, AC aso.

Sometime I switch to 1080p 120Hz on my OLED TV. The picture quality is simple too good to not use it for gaming. "
711," As a guy.

why do you think this is?

Some female characters just got so interesting that they became my main characters.

How did you you develop this characters?

It just happens. I develop many characters and some are female.

How does your character reflect you and do you think you relate to them better than someone of the same gender as you?

I can relate to some female characters more easily than to some males and to some not as well. Some barely reflect me some reflect me very well.

Are there any realizations about yourself that youve arrived at?

Not really. Maybe a better understanding of other people IRL?

PS: Research into certain topics to make your characters more real can be quite awkward.

712," It's incredibly difficult for me to write them down. Not because they loose their magic or something. I'm simply awful at reading and writing stories. I don't say something in my head, I see and feel it. This may sound kinda strange, but not even dialogue is necessarily in words.  I also can't decide if they speak in English or German. I just switch between them on the fly.

When I try writing it down, I always get frustrated after just a few words. "
713, Perfectly normal 
714, Your old 7200rpm should load a bit faster than a run of the mill 5400rpm one. 
715," You shouldn't swap the hard drive just put it in as a second drive. Its almost as easy as connecting and formatting an external one.

 #x200B;

Are you sure your 240Gb Hard drive isn't an SSD? 240Gb isn't a typical HDD capacity today. SSD's are much faster so I would keep it as my main boot device. "
716," In terms of average read/writes, yes. Peak read/write might be lower due to modern cache on HDDs. So browsing/copying small files on it may feel slower, but actually loading should be as fast or even faster in sustained loads. The improvements where made mostly in other areas than speed. "
717, Nice GTX 960 nudes you got there. But what brand of clothes is she usually wearing? 
718," Sometimes, but only when flying. "
719," Seems about right. During my BFV session the other day.

GPU power max: \~330 W

GPU Clock: \~1700 Mhz

HBM Clock: 1075 Mhz

Core temp max: 65 C

Hot spot temp max: \~95 C

VRM max: \~70 C

 #x200B;

If I recall correctly.

The clock speed can have a pretty high average due to a cpu bottleneck. "
720, Its the quietest AIO I've ever came across.  
721, Usually you just ask the host. Most of the time they don't want to have the stuff. If they don't want it its considered rude to leave it there.  
722,"  I have more trust in the ""Norwegian krone-zone"" to remain functional than I have in the Eurozone  
  

That's something I can get behind.  
  
What exactly annoys you?  
  
Calculating how much something actually costs, Always having different currencies in my wallet just in case(maybe that's the paranoid German in me) and additional bank fees.
I was in five different countries last year, where I purchased with something other than the euro. In six countries with different currencies. I'm used to it, but its annoying. I always appreciate it when I can pay in euro.
 "
723," Dividing everything by seven, then complaining about the high prices and then being surprised how much i actually spend worked out pretty well the last 10years. I will just continue doing it like this. "
724, There is still the exchange mark up. Either direct or indirect. And you need to calculate what you are actually paying. 
725," May I ask why you are happy that you don't use it?

It's pretty annoying if you frequently visit different Scandinavian countries.  "
726," Exactly the same for me. My Job and the internet is almost exclusively in English, but I'm a native German living in Germany. So it depends on the topic I dream about. Most of the time I don't even realize in which language I dream. It's not something I do consciously.  "
727," This still depends on what you want to do. I use edge for my office stuff, taking notes, research, and as a pdf reader. Firefox for general browsing and chrome for google services. That's the best balance I've found. "
728," You can't really compare edge in an business environment with other browsers or non business environment. I'm currently sitting in front of 2 PC, one is my ""work"" pc and the other one is my oos work pc. I'm using edge on both and the difference is night and day. "
729," I also think the fact AMD released the card is because they decided to go along with the price fixing, I mean why the sudden announcement when they said they weren't releasing it(? correct me if I'm wrong there, haven't done a lot of research on that)

You are right, they said they wouldn't release it last year, which is also why I didn't expect the cards. The VII branding just popped up relative recently, which was assumed to be Instinct branding for Vega 20. The Radeon VII as a prosumer product looks rushed. They saw a quick opportunity to make money and took it.   Without better yields than expected and the high price for an RTX 2080 the product would probably not exist.

 #x200B; "
730," No, I'm not forgetting the Tensor cores.  TU104-400/A (TU104)  is  545 mm and Vega 10 is  486 mm. Vega 20(Radeon VII) has to have a bigger memory controller and the difference in size between 14nm and 12nm is next to non existent. But due to 7nm Vega 20 is  only  331 mm, so it should be much cheaper right? I don't know, but Nvidia also had the possibility to go with 7nm instead of 12 like most of r/nvidia seemed to think not that long ago. As you said both companies want money and nvidia based its decision to go with 12 on that. Yields are better than expected according to AMD which is probably the reason why we have this card. Still I don't think the cost per chip is that different. 

So I don't think its price fixing.

That being said 699$ is still too expensive and not a good buy for gamers at all.  "
731, Samsung charges 80$ per 4Gb stack....Nvidia pays Micron 94$ for the 8gb on the RTX2080 and 2070....Just to put things a bit into perspective. 
732, Both on Stock? 
733, The first gen of gcn was released in late 2011. 
734, That's true and probably the main reason why this product exists. Still the whole hardware is pretty expensive compared to Nvidias. Though Nvidias chips are bigger this time around. 
735, Kinda the opposite today. AMD drivers are pretty good. But their hardware is pretty lacking in terms of gaming performance to say the least.  
736, I highly doubt it's price fixing on AMDs side. 4 Stacks of HBM2 are really expensive and 7nm is a completely new node. 12nm is well established and gddr6 is not that different in price to gddr5.  
737, shouldn't be a new chipset sufficient for PCIe 4.0 support? 
738," I didn't realize gypsy was referring to an ethnic group for a long time. I just assumed everyone meant those aggressive beggars who didn't want to integrate at all. 

 

I bet there are many who don't know it as well. "
739, Depends too heavily on usecase. The only thing which is consistant is the higher power draw. 
740, The MI50 runs at a max boost of 1600MHz and for the performance it looks like this thing will do 1800. It will most likely just be like MI25 vs. RX Vega 64 
741,  In BFV for example I just turn down one or two settings to high and got almost the same performance at 4k with my overclocked card....I'm definetly not upgrading. 
742," 7nm aint cheap, too "
743," If you take it seriously I highly doubt you will do more harm than good. Sounds to me a bit like religion. If you do good according to it, you will go to heaven and so on. "
744, Similar. They accused each other for ruining their lives. They were married till me and my younger brother graduated. He only really realized it when we were in adulthood. I didn't take nearly as long. I mean he showed of to me with pictures of his gf while he was drunk. I was 14...... 
745," How long does it take for Intel between announcing something and releasing them? Shouldn't be too long. I doubt we'll get something this month though. Price drops will be felt before that however, because demand of old components drops as most are holding of for the next generation. "
746," I have a DAC and good Sennheiser headphones. I play a lot of Battlefield and the sound in those games is amazing.

It helps to hear exactly what's happening around you, the sound is clearer. But for gaming a midrange setup is usually sufficient. Music with a range and at least 256kbts or Dolby atmos is where you have the most gains from high end audio equipment. "
747, Its subjective and also depends on which media you use. But there can certainly be a huge difference. 
748, Its an 14 year old game after all. Single thread performance is king. 
749, Thats to be expected if your bottleneck is elsewhere or the framerate is locked. 
750, Basically yes. There is almost no difference in performance between an 4k super resolution and using native 4k. The driver lets the PC think it has a 4k display connected and then scales the resolution down before sending it to your monitor. 
751, This is PCMR. We prefer to use a wired connection. 
752, You can set a superresolution in your graphic drivers. The game will render in 4k and it will be scaled down to 1080p. I used this as an AA method for a while. 
753," If your cooling and MB is sufficient, 1.34V should be safe. "
754, Doesn't hurt to wait one day. Prices also might drop even further due to Zen2 without it even releasing. 
755, Wait till tomorrows AMD Keynote at CES for Zen 2 (Ryzen 3000series) 
756, This kind of setup is ideal for 1440p gaming with adaptive sync. 
757, For gaming? NO 
758, Your Bottleneck will bounce between CPU and GPU in games like BF5  on 1440p ultra. You wont always stay above 100fps even if you lower the settings(CPU bottleneck). But its never the case that one component will slow down the other to much if you stay on ultra. 
759, It can get really expensive in some countries. Although I heavily disagree with the statement that Vega is non-viable and always worse than similarly priced Nvidia card. 
760," Power hungry computing beast, which are fun to tinker with. The RX Vega 56 can be really great value. They are awesome for certain games like BFV and COD BO4. There are some really good AIB cards out there (Sapphire and Powercolor) which makes most Nvidia AIB look bad in comparison. The drivers and features are also better imo. "
761," rtx 2080ti it is

 #x200B; "
762, I have the 850 G3. You are fine if you don't do an excessive OC. You should OC and undervolt you GPU. With a +50% power target the card pulls 325W with peaks up to 375W. If your other components besides cpu aren't using a crazy amount of power you should be fine. Peak efficiency of you PSU is around 90% load anyway. 
763, Tomorrow is the AMD Keynote at CES. I would wait two days and then decide on the components.  
764," That would be the time I broke my back in two different places. The feeling is worse than the pain though. It feels like you upped body isn't connected to your lower body and its just resting on top of it. If you try to stand/sit up it gets much worse. Painkillers didn't really do much, if anything. It took over half a year for the pain to go away. Luckily I don't have any permanent damage, besides being 1cm smaller. "

771, They aren't dinosaurs but were covered in a different kind of fluff.  
772, Dinosaurs covered in feathers as large as 9m long Tyrannosaurids have also been found.  
773," You forgot the /s. 

For those interested:


Penguins have a completely different body structure and types of feathers than T-Rex would have. Stegosaurids aren't a theropod dinosaurs.

Dinosaurs fossiled with feather imprints. 9m long Tyrannosaurids(Yutyrannus) with feathers were already found.

779," Yes, when I read I visualize the scene immediately and when some new details pop up I add them.
But when the new details don't fit in my current picture I need to do it all over again. This gets frustrating really fast. I end up dropping the book and dream up my own story from the bits I've read. Similar situation with audio books. Some books I have powered through, but it takes really long for me to finish.
I have no problems with science books, comics/Maga and watching movies.  "

781," 512Gb Nvme SSD + 2*256 SD cards. I put my games on the SD card, which works surprisingly well.  "
782," I never had an excuse and got into trouble for it a lot. For example teachers thought I didn't want to talk to them. Turns out I had absence seizures. Im also a heavy daydreamer so those two amplifyed each other. Now I can use it as an excuse even though sometimes I'm just daydreaming.

Soooo yeah make sure there isn't a legit excuse first. 
 A diagnosis would certainly had helped me to at least get out of trouble.  "
783, I dream. The main difference is that in my dreams I'm always the protagonist and in my daydreams I'm rarely. I sometimes can control my dreams. It's really hard for me to distinguish between actual dream and daydreams at night after I slept. That's why I asked.  
784," Do you dream?   

  

Have you noticed some big differences between your daydreams and your actual dreams?  

  

Do you have nightmares?  

  

Can you control you dreams?

785," Being bored or not interested in what was happening around me. 

 

When I was bored as a child I started daydreaming. I discovered that my dreams where more interesting than most of rl. Its like having the ability to watch a good movie anytime anywhere. I replaced everything boring with daydreams. I dreamed my way through school, replaced boring social interaction with daydreaming and so on.    "
786," There are plenty of those somewhat well paid jobs in IT. 

And even if you only MD all day long you are more productive than some people I've 'worked' with........  "
787," Also driving manual should help a bit. It's hard to stay focused especially on American roads. All those Damm long straights. Don't know what I would have done on my California road trip without those nice vista's and the mustang.
I was surprised how little I mdd when I first started driving.  "
788,"  Try to think ahead while driving, try to anticipate every action of other drivers as much as you can(we call that ""vorausschauendes Fahren"" in Germany). It will make you a better driver and stop you from mdd. Keep your mind occupied. "
789, Same. As with everything moderation is key. 
790," This is probably the one thing im different than most of the community. I certainly don't mind a good progression system, so do as you like. But I don't give a fuck about it as long as all gameplay relevant things can be unlocked without a grind.  "
791," Could someone kindly point me in a direction of a good video or guide regarding overclocking RAM, more specifically tweaking the settings shown in the image above?

Yeah was under a different impression. "
792," Which platform? If you got more slots than actual lanes, you steal bandwidth from another device connected over the same lanes. If you got some spare ones you can use stuff like NVMe SSDs, network cards, usb cards usw. If not do nothing with them. "
793, I think he's looking to get more performance out of his components and tightening the timings does improve the performance. 
794," Those calculators aren't anything to go by. I think it means that when you get a 20% better cpu your fps will improve, but when you get a 21% better cpu you will have the same performance, because now for example the gpu is at 100% capacity. Its really depending on the task and hardware where your bottleneck will be and calculator can't take everything into account. "
795, Same goes for Germany as well 
796, HBM doesn't like it hot. Try to stay around 65C on HBM and test again. If it still has that behavior roll back the driver. 
797, My card still crashes if i use any of the auto clocking features. So personally I can't recommend them. But your mileage may vary. Just try it and monitor it with the performance overlay. Then decide if its good enough. 
798," Not really.

NVIDIA also focused heavily on ray tracing at gdc.

Whats new with those approaches is that its hybrid rendering. AMD does it only on the software side, while RTX uses hardware acceleration.  "
799, For now I would recommend to use your gpu encoder with only little compression and a high bitrate. Record to a SSD and compress the files afterwards. The big downside are the large file sizes. 
800," Its your CPU. Every 4Thread one on stock can have problems with getting 60fps, especially the locked non K ones.

I would try to get my hands on a cheap i7 for your socket/chipset.  "
801," If you don't need that last extra C, you can use the stock thermal paste. If you need it use a separate one, but clean your cooler and cpu throroughly before applying. And remember less is more. "
802," Are you using future frame rendering? Do your have DX12 enabled? 

A 4Core 4Thread CPU can bottleneck you hard in 4Player conquest.

How many frames are you getting in Singleplayer? If its much more its very likely a cpu bottleneck.Or do you have less than 8Gb of ram? "
803, This humanoid style of body is really advantagious for the use of tool though.  
804," Thay did catch up with the latest drivers. The best thing is you don't have to register for anything. 

But it overall has still more problems than shadowplay. "
805," Reducing stress helps me. Get stuff out of mind. Then I can have sweet dreams. If I don't I start to feel miserable. I also need a topic to dream about. A thing I find fascinating, a feeling, a situation, a story, a character aso.. I make some time where i do simple task such as walking or simply nothing. Music also helps, but I need the right kind fitting the mood. I literally take vacation days to DD.  

I do all of this to make a balance and stopping my DD to turn into MDD. "
806," For me its not one game but the Battlefield series.

Im pretty consistent. On Average a bit over 250h per year since 2008. So 2500h.

Some guys I regularly play with have that in BF4 alone.I'm still kicking their asses. "
807," No, why? "
808, The R7 has more cores and is much better in productivity workloads. For gaming the R5 is only slightly behind. So i would go for the 2600X for a more balanced build for gaming. 
809," Unlikely. It's not mentioned anywhere which Bluetooth standard it uses. Usually the marketing is keen to point that out. It should have at least BT 4.1 APTX for the sound quality it tries to achieve. 

Its most like some other proprietary technology.

840, Not necessary I believe you. Its just unusual.  
841, So you are telling me Gigabyte payed Intel royalty fees to use XMP on AMD chipsets even though its not required for the ram to run out of CPU spec? Maybe they just wanted to use it because its more convenient (easier for compatibility with many different RAM manufacturers?). On ASUS boards Its DOCP which does almost exactly the same as XMP. 
842, Which board? 
843, Getting it to 3000 shouldn't be difficult. even if docp doesn't work. Or is your CPU overclocked to the max? 
844, XMP is intel. DOCP is AMD. Set DOCP to DOCP(standard). Of your ram is on the list from the mb manufacturer it should set it to 3000MHz.

Something like limited screentime or collecting the smartphone when it was time to sleep, seems to be fairly normal.

Absolutely no restriction on dating and curfews were very loose especially in teen years. Heck I did come back home at 3AM at the age of 14 or so (pre smartphone). Forbidding junk food would be considered strange. Its normal to eat healthy at home and junk while going out with friends. 

Age rating on games were a completely different subject when i went to school. We had a few school shootings in the 00s and Videogames were blamed. So no violent video games. Today nobody really cares. "

859," A friend swapped to pascal, because Vega took so long. One thing he didn't realize was that he had to use different drivers. He complained a lot...

I cant imagine what the experience will be if you do it the other way round after this release. "
860," Manfred Weber is pro (internet) surveillance which many people on the internet don't seem to like.

861," Can I give the typical German answer? No! It depend son the working field however I rarely do any small talk, not even in during my breaks here in Germany. Then again almost everyone I regularly meet at is 20+ years older and a something something manager. I also have many international contacts, mainly Europe and you notice the difference. The more south(maybe east) you go the more you talk (when they speak English or someone talks to them in their native language). Norway doesn't seem as bad as Germany but they are not exactly talkative. For whatever reasons Bulgarians and Hungarians on the other hand are very talkative. "
862," It matters. Have you ever played on 45 or 30 vs 60 fps? You will notice it even though your reaction time is much 15x or 10x  that amount. Same with latency. Why is playing with mouse and keyboard so shit on a TV even with only 21ms delay?
It feels smother. You could also argue that your eye can't distinguish between two pixels on an 27'' 1080p or 1440p monitor why should anyone use a 4k one. The difference in both cases is miniscule but noticeable for almost everyone who plays shooters regularly.  "
863," For fps gaming? No! For many other genres this can be viable, but not for fps. Even if you don't see the difference, you can feel it because of the lower latency.  "
864," I would go so far an claim that BF profits more from the higher res than 240Hz, due to the long engagement distances.  "
865, 2.5s of spewing bullets at a squad should be enough to kill them + better capability of killing one or two guys up close. Doesn't seem useless to me. I can't wait.  
866, That was 11th grade for me. In 12th I dropped art and Latin.  
867, Sports was usually on Wednesday from 17:00 to 18:30 uh and German from 15:15 to 16:45 but every other week we had history instead.... Monday was chemistry and Math  so only one 45 and one 90minute one...... Total chaos 
868, Corrected it 
869," For example I had Math LK, Physics LK, chemistry, programming/edv, philosophy, economics, German, English, Art, PE and history. That was roughly 30h per week of pure lessons without any breaks. And that was the minimum. We could also choose Music, biology, religion, education, sociology, geography, French, Spanish, Dutch, old Greek(one of our teachers was very passionate), Russian and some I probably forgot.

Edit: and literature  "
870," It also was depending on the subject if it was bi weekly. Religion/Philosophy for example was one 90min lesson and another 45 Minute one. In rare cases we had 135min lessons with a brake in between for example in Art or Programming/edv.
Due to G8, too many students at my school and this kind of structure, we had up to 6 90min lessons per day. This meant 35h+ weeks and sometimes even staying in school from 7:45 to 18:45 + Homework... Some students had burnout at the age of 16.  "
871, What a relief. Let the experimenting with different loadouts begin......I can't wait to test out the high fire rate tree on the MG42 
872, So you are telling me I don't have to purchase the other part of the tree? God dammit.........  
873," I use every gun and vehicle in every Battlefield. I do not care if I have to grind for cosmetics as long as I can have every gameplay relevant unlock without a huge grind. After 75h and 50h of them on lvl50 I got almost every weapon/vehicle at lvl5 with one path unlocked. My coins run out and I'm not able to respec, which is the problem.  "

876," Italian ones are great

Italian sports cars. Not your normal fiat. They are also viewed as something designed/build with passion and not as an engineering marvel.

Volvo gets a lot of praise here. Weird tail lights but they are seen as well build.  "
877, I had a similar childhood. One time I injured a friend so bad he had to get stitched up at the hospital. We went on a camping trip together the next day..... Never really bin in a serious fight. Simpler days indeed. When you told someone to fuck off they did exactly that.  
878," Some are just really bad at articulating stuff. I've got two friend's both are really intelligent, one is good at it and one really bad. One ends up translating for the other through asking the right questions. The process is pretty entertaining.  "
879, I have the opposite problem. Im really really bad at citing. A always have to triple check when im quoting something. Makes people think I'm pulling that stuff out of my ass..... 
880," If the videos or Wikipedia articles have good sources listed, why not? Certanly easier than list a bunch of studies.  

 But more often than not those people are drones who repeat stuff, especially on youtube. "
881," I am sorry, but many drinking cultures are not represented in this survey. It seems to target a specific American culture.  "
882, And with all your additional information I went from 3300USD to roughly 17000USD. What about software? That Shit adds up..... A couple thousand more.... And I'm only in my mid 20's and paid everything from my hard earned money.  
883," When I start daydreaming while exercising I know I'm not pushing myself hard enough. Its a way to find my breaking point. This way I'm always improving. Well, until I go beyond my breaking point and it gets really unhealthy. 

Or you could say a make it an ACTIVITY instead of something I do passively.  "
884," Here in West-Westfalia we got surnames ending with -hues. So for example Kalfhues(Calf house).
Haven't met a hues which didn't originate from this region.  "
885," He was the chancellor, which is equivalent to prime minister and effectively the closest thing to the american president here in Germany.  "
886," We dub everything so some videogames have a really good dub. The Witcher series is one of them. A huge plus is that it's a polish game so many things are familiar to Germans and translate really well. I think more so than the English version, which overall dub i don't like that much. "
887," I don't think it's a coping mechanism for a trauma. I'm epileptic which I only found out when I already was 21. Maybe it had something to do with that. Also my ability to express my thoughts feels muted and because of that I mostly think about stuff without actually expressing them in any way.

But I do think many use it to cope with trauma.

888," One of my colleagues, who hosted an international online training for upcoming changes in the IT-Infrastructure, had Ryzen logos everywhere on his PC (desktop aso). Now the european management and a few hundred people think he's either a consultant from AMD or a huge AMD fanboy. "
889," No and I don't want them to stop. Stopping would be like killing a huge part of me, the creative part nonetheless. I for sure would dream less and not that excessive, which are the main problems.

892, There are different forms of FGM just like there are different forms of MGM. Circumcision is just one of them and  as harmful as some forms of FGM.  
893," As a fellow German, I couldn't agree more. During the elections the only german Trump ""supporters"" I know said he is the lesser evil, because he's completely incompetent and not just straight up evil.  Their view on the US was already pretty bad. "
894," Yes, ofc were we mad. The view of the US under Obama got a pretty hard hit because of that. It got better over time. But that was almost nothing compared to Trump. "
895, The button press would likely also make most of its damage via climate change. 
896," Because of comments like this I expected most stores and fast food restaurant to have open all the time in the US.

On my first visit I was surprised how much is actually closed. Its much harder to find a fast food restaurant besides McDonald's (which is sh\*t in the US) or an open Walmart after 11pm than I was expecting. I'm talking about CA here. "

Next platform DDR5 and PCIe4 "
901, My exact thought. Even the left one looks shit.

907," I think EA customer support is strongly depending on the country you are in. 
 
Here in Germany I only had great experiences with the EA support. Beeing part of such a huge company they only can directly do so much, but they really try to help you.

911," In BF1 it was easy for me to be MVP in CQ64 if there were no ace pilots around.

Im upper mid in BF5, but that's mainly because im still testing out stuff. Im sure when I have everything figured/tested out I will be top again, just like in the alpha and beta. It will be so satisfying to see my stats always increasing over time. "
912," They they do a bit. Dice did a good job with them, but they are a bit too loud compared to the male ones. It could only be because they are higher pitched. Still I think DICE should slightly lower their volume. "
913," Around 90fps everything on ultra and future frame rendering on at 1440p. Sometime above 100. If I lower some setting I cant get close to a locked 144fps without any big visual sacrifices, at least in the SP. For 64 Player Conquest Im CPU limited with dips into the 90s. I guess I will increase my OC again to stay above 100 and maybe play around with dx12. My Hardware is a Ryzen R7 1700x, RX Vega 64 liquid cooled and 32Gb DDR4 3200 cl14 "
914," Na, they want local bot matches for training "
915," Gigabyte - UD PRO 512 GB 2.5"" Solid State Drive

Yes, but it sends mixed signals. One the one hand it uses a reliable controller which supports ecc. On the other had its designet for MLC and the rated read and write cycles are lower than on the competitors. So idk. 

I only have experience  with Samsungs EVO/Pro, Crucial MX and an intel SSD which name I forgot. All of them turned out to be reliable and fast "
916," You usually get better value out of an 3 or 4Tb drive. You wont necessarily need it, but when you do its really nice to have. Also the drives are usually a bit better quality wise as 1TB are almost always budget drives "
917," While usually refurbished is worth the risk, an OLED is a different story. OLED has burn in and doesn't last as long as LED. It isn't an issue for most, I have and LG OLED a year and no burn in, but its much harder to tell what already happened to this TV. Wait for black Friday and then get a new C7/8 or something with the same Panel "
918," Get yourself a better drive with more capacity. I for example never had a WD RED fail on me.

I wouldn't recommend RAID1 for desktop use, simply because its much easier and safer to just make regular backup to an external HDD.  "
919," Wait for black Friday, get whatever is best value and then save up for the other thing. You can always pick up enough games for a few bucks later if you are on a budget. "
920, Get a height adjustable one if you can afford it. Your back and neck will thank you. 
921, Both 
922, With the ASUS model RX Vega Model you have to be careful because the VRM isn't properly cooled. With the strix model I wouldn't too heavily go to the extremes. Only go down with the voltage to around 1.15V. That's still enough for Overclocking.  The cooler is good otherwise. If you are lucky you can get close to 1600MHz on 1.1V and with \~300W power draw. You should be able to get the HBM over 1000MHz. Wattman is good enough and works quiet well. The Crimson drivers also have an overlay for monitoring you performance.

926," They are in an grey area. They are legit in the terms that they work when you get them from a non shady source. The worst thing that happens is MS deactivates the key because it wasn't meant for redistribution. So you have get a new one maybe from the same source for free as a replacement. MS doesn't bother to check those licenses so its unlikely that you will run into problems. Most of these licenses are from OEM systems sold to companies who used their own windows licenses.  So Microsoft already got their money twice. From the OEM and the company. I'm currently sitting on 200 unused OEM licenses, but cant use any of them due to policies. If you want to be completely on the legit side there are key stores which have retail licenses for 50 bucks. "

I'm into world building and the world most of my stories take place to this day was conceived when I was in 2nd grade 20 years ago.
I was wandering on a beach while waiting for my little brother and mum to catch up. It started with an abandoned castle in the desert, a guy returning and the question how it got there. Or in other words I saw a sandcastle and gave it a history.  "

The blower is a non issue if you undervolt and only overclock the HBM. The towersize doesn't matter.

934," Can It run Crysis? 

 

Crysis 3 is still one of the best looking games imo and I like the gameplay. My library looks similar to yours. "
935," Either your Motherboard, cooling or CPU are really bad or you are doing it wrong. Which workload doesn't work above your overclock? "
936, On an mid to high AMD combo there is little difference. Just a bit more CPU usage. 
937, A don't feel for the dead. I only care about the living. If some in close dies I can't stop myself for not caring. Sure keeping good memories is important but mourning for the dead? Funerals are just a chore for me. My brother tried to beat me up because of it.  
938, So the menu point DXR Raytracing is locked at Ultra in the advanced menu for custom settings?  
939, Can you change the RTX settings under advanced?

941," We are only talking about the powergrid of germany which is as of 2017 sitting at \~35% renewables, lignite is at 25%, coal, nuclear and gas at around 13%

In the case of france 70% is nuclear. Thats where germany wants to be with renewables in 12 Years.

Overall consumption is a different story.

The target of the current government is 45% in 2025 and the greens want more. "
942," We would need to more than double the output of renewable in 12 Years, just like we did over the last 12 Years. Seems doable.  "
943," eah, let's burn coal for the next 32 years, a very good idea indeed, and very environment-friendly.

Its not like they will shut down all coal powerplants in 2050. The target would be to shut down the biggest offender in the next three years and then the rest till 2030. Fossil fuel contains more then just coal, gas for example and everything gradually.

Come on, what's the avg energy income of a solar panel or a wind generator per square kilometer in watts? Is it even comparable with fossils?  

Ok lets make a comparison. 

The powerplants Frimmersdorf and Neurath are fed by the surface mine Garzweiler. They produce combined 6624MW. Garzweiler alone has an area of 30.96km. An inland Windpark can make on average 24MW per km so on the same Area it would produce 743.04MW. If we look at a solar in Germany we get 50MWp/km or 1.548GWp for the Garzweiler area.

Not too far off.

The great thing especially about Solar energy is that you can spread them out. The bad thing is their inconsistency.

 Nuclear is a completely different beast. "
944," If I open the YouTube trends for Germany I see a lot of Turkish stuff....so I guess that's popular? (I personally can't stand anything on there, be it Turkish or German).


Nordic detective/crime thrillers are also popular.

Everything is dubbed....  "
945," What exactly did they want?

To be Completely fossil free till 2050.

To power the massive german industry with windmills?   
  
Yeah our flour industry is ginormous..... 

They want to achieve that with the use of renewable energy like windturbines, solar installations. Depending on the stage they want to mainly use different gas Powerplants to bridge the gaps. First fossil then synthetic. Maybe after 2050 also use fusion plants as a fall back. Currently they are inciting also hysteria regarding coal power. We seem to get there in the same time it would take to build and upgrade our nuclear powerplants.  "

954," No. Mainly because of budgeting. Our government has a huge surplus, but many things are managed by the local government, some of which have a huge deficit. It would also make things like education more homogeneous.  "
955," Not mine, but on a friends 2500k. I run a Ryzen/Vega system.  "
956," 1. Its really hardware taxing, but still playable even on an 2500k. It runs really stable frame time wise on amd hardware.
 
2. At first glance the maps don't looks special but the way they play out makes the special. Overall I really like them. 

9/10 awesome gameplay, menus are a bit frustrating, missing some content though I personally don't care for the typical cliche  WWII stuff. I don't care for the sp either even if it was good.

959,  The network quality of for example O2 is shit here. And the 20 are either older contracts which are used mainly for telephony or are more expensive d1 contracts with smartphones included.  
960, I was just thinking on the top of my head how much I paid in the past and how much my family and friends pay all of them have only one Sim.  
961, 20 includes telephony and SMS. You can get it cheaper than 5 if you don't need any speed or high availability. But we are basically a African country in cost per GB. We can afford it though.  
962, At least 5 for one Gigabyte. But it can also be 20 per GB. In many countries you can get unlimited for that.  
963, Yep. Has a bit the taste of an inferiority complex to me.  
964," You are weird because you think you are weird.

Nothing else seems weird to me.  "
965, I create whole worlds when I dd and I stay long in them. I'm male and first all my main protagonist were male. But the more developed the female side characters got the more they started to be main characters as well.  
966, It's just more difficult to communicate. But besides that it's awesome. I can stare at a wall for hours and not get bored.  
967, Just like your vision. If I focus on something it's sharp but everything else is still there. I think if you can change you focus very fast everything seems more sharp.  
968, I first make a picture and then make it move through logical associations I have. Not really words but kinda. If someone says a snake is slithering and I imagine the most neutral picture of a snake I can get and then apply the movement. Ask me later what someone said to me and the scene comes to mind. I may have forgotten the words. I answere with the most neutral words I associate with this scene.  
969," I'm heavily on the visualization side.  
 
It's really difficult for me to read books. I make a picture/movie of a scene immediately and every detail which is revealed later makes me visualize the whole scene again.  It's very frustrating. Reading papers is really easy for me but writing them is difficult because it's hard for me to find the right words. I don't think in words I thinks in logic association. That's also why I'm bad or better slow at debating. Describing things takes a long time for me. It's as easy for me to remember numbers as it is for me to learn names. Makes remembering passwords really easy. It's easy for me to take things in but every way to communicate or express those things is difficult and it seems muted. I envy artists for being able to do it but I loose my patience.

One time in my German class(I'm German) we talked about the origin of language. I remember one girl seriously saying we can't think without language. I was shocked, because it's was unimaginable for me to just use word or language. This was the first time I was made aware of the fact that It is a spectrum.  "
970, Are you sure about [any cat](https://www.catsthatlooklikehitler.com)?  
971," Germany is very decentralized, especially in the west. The east was behind the Iron curtain, is much more centralized around Berlin and to this day behind when in terms of gdp. Berlin doesn't really have a big source when it comes to gdp. Hamburg has its harbour, Frankfurt has its financial sector, Munich has company headquarters and so on. Usually these things are all in the capital, but Berlin not being in the west is missing out here.
 
On a positive note Berlin has a growth rate which is 1% higher then average.  "
972, Ach Berlin. The only capital in Europe which lowers the gdp per inhabitant of the whole country.  
973, Screwdriver  
974," At 1600Mhz with an undervolt my card draws around 280W. And the 390 should draw around 250W. Now Add chill into the mix which you should already use and Vega profits more than Grenada and you end up with nearly identical power consumption to a Vega 56 and your card.
OK mine is watercooled so at 1600MHz the average Vega will  will be over 300w but if you go near stock it should be the same.
 
But in your case I still would recommend to upgrade.  "
975," Why is it bad? In this case it means the earliest they can get out of prison is in 14 or 13 years. They can stay in for longer.

The legal system is built around rehabilitation and not punishment. Which is more effective. It's great imo.  "

978, As Su said they also don't scale well when it comes to overall more performance. The only reason to have them on the same die is latency.  
979, It's also there for direct communication between the cores on different chiplets. That's the interesting part. We don't know how fast and how high the latency of that is.

From our perspective here in the north west, Bavarians and Austrians don't seem that different. We understand you both equally well so....both are almost a different language.

988," I don't live in an area with many tourists.
So the biggest stereotype is that Dutch caravans crawl on the left lane of the Autobahn. 
 "
989," It's the best cooler in terms of noise and temperature I've ever had. At 350W power draw that thing stays cool n quiet. Mine has a tiny bit of coil whine (my fault, wasn't present before I did some stupid overclicking). The only reason I notice that is because that thing is so quiet. On other cards it probably won't be noticeable due to fan noise.  "

992,"  I did go to school in the 00s.
 
Violent video games were blamed for the shootings.
Some teachers took that very serious. When the teacher caught wind that we played them the parents were informed and we had to write essays on why they are bad. Meanwhile we played counterstrike on the school computers with some other teachers. Fun times. "
993," A lot of them seem to dig holes which is incredibly ugly, and seem to be somewhat rude oftentimes. They seem to assume everyone in the Netherlands speaks German, not even asking if you do before starting their German rant.

995," I would say to most here the separation seems a bit unnecessary, rules/laws should be followed and there are many idiots on both sides.
It's not that we don't get that Catalonia is very different, we just don't really think it would be beneficial for anybody involved.  "
996, Where did you get that idea from?  
997, AKS-74U 
998, I think it's cartel and drug traffic related. So many violent crimes but they may not necessarily impact not directly involved citizens that much.

1000," I've met a Dutch in Austria who was living there for a couple of years. He had the funniest German accent I've ever heard.
He ended up speaking Dutch to us and we spoke German.  "
1001," **Budget:** Up to 200 (Germany)

**Source/Amp** \- Bluetooth Samsung Galaxy S8 and Surface book 2

**How the gear will be used** \- Home and travel usage. Good sound isolation and only little sound leakage. I want use them for listening to music and watch some movies/Videos either at home or while traveling at the Airport or sitting at home. They need to be Wireless because the headphone jack position on the surface book sucks and I need more freedom. One charge should last for more than 5h. They should also be in ears because of size and I also want more freedom for head movement when I'm relaxing in bed for example. Being able to use them while doing sport is a nice plus but very low on the priority list. I wont do any phone calls with them.

**Preferred tonal balance** \- Im not a bass-head, I like a clear sound.

**Preferred music genre(s)** \- Metal, Rock, Classic. To name a few: Led Zeppelin, Eagles, Black Sabath, Godsmack, Marylin Manson, Rammstein, Babymetal, Cult to Follow, Blind Guardian, Hans Zimmer, John Williams, Howard Shore, Johann Sebastian Bach, Ludwig van Beethoven aso. 

**Past** **gear experience**  \- My main pair of headphones are Sennheiser HD598 which are great. The current IEM I want to replace are Sony MDR-EX650AP which are sturdy af. Im lacking in in-ear experience because i simply used the ones which came with  apple devices for years and then I bought the Sony's after to many of them broke down. I have listened to quite a few headphone and dac/amps but not many in ears.

**What** **aspect of your current listening experience would you like to improve?** I want to hear ""more"", than I currently do with my Sony MDR-EX650AP while also loosing the wires.  "

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

*The build should be Black and white/silver. 
 
*Provide enough headroom to get a R7 1700 to 3.9Ghz (less if I loose the silicon lottery)  
  
*Silent  
 
*If possible 32GB RAM at 3200Mhz 
  
*8 SATA connectors would be prefered  
  
*White/RGB LED would be a nice touch but not necessary  
 
*Enough power for a RX Vega card  
  
*At least a 80+ Gold PSU
   
I want to do an Ryzen/Vega build for my 1440p 144Hz FreeSync Monitor. This build will be purchased after the AIB RX vega cards hit the shelfs (early september i hope). When RX Vega will absolutly fail I will change the GPU to a 1080ti if I can find one in the right price range, even though i didn't like Nvidia cards/software in the past. The main parts Im unsure about are the mainboard, RAM and PSU. 
  
I like to tinker around with PC components so tweaking isn't a problem (bios update, overlclocking and so on).
I have done Ryzen builds in the past but not with a budget this high, thats why I want to be sure and asking /r/buildapc. Any kind of advice is welcome.
 "
1003,  
1004," I thought I would share a story about why you shouldn't buy custom PC's from stores if you don't know much about the subject.  
 
The story began after a friend ascended in 2011. 
  
Since had witnessed the glory of PC gaming for the first time, he wanted a gaming PC. So he checked online some requirements for the games he wanted to play. Then he went to the next best PC seller he knew and got himself a gaming rig at a somewhat reasonable Price. The specs on paper were a decent intel CPU(cant remember exacly which), 4Gb ram and a 560ti. He didn't wanted me to build his PC, because he wanted a warranty for the whole system and didn't wanted the hassle with troubleshooting. For a few weeks he played non demanding games like AoE and so on, but then Battlefield 3 was about to release. He downloaded the beta and suprise it didn't work. After telling me the specs he invited me to help getting the beta to run, which i did. The first thing I did was checking if the monitor was plugged in the mainboard. You know the typical rookie mistake. It was. But then I saw that the 560ti was missing. I asked were it was and he just showed me the bill which contained the 560ti.  
  
On the same day we went to the store and demanded the GPU, but the salesman refused even though we showed him the computer with the metal covers still on the case. After a short rant I demanded to see the manager. I made him check his whole inventory. There it was one spare 560ti! He offered to build it into his Pc, but I just took it. 
 
Ok until this point the store just could have make a mistake without malicious intend.  
 
Then my friend told me his neighbour recomended this shop to him. He also recently bought a PC there. 
Of course I asked him what specs he had. Same processor, ram but a 560 non ti (both were non oem). He paid a little more for it than my friend, despite both systems having the same Hardware/Software except GPU and were aviable to him for the current prices. The reason for why he bought the weaker system was that the salesmen told him the 560 was newer and therefore better.  
 
Now both of have rigs which they build themself with my help.  
 
The moral of the story is don't buy stuff without any knowledge about the subject or consult an independent third party.  
 
TL;DR: Friend and his neighbour got screwed over by a shady system seller. "
1005,  
1006," In May 2017, many pieces of information regarding the RX Vega series was unveiled, including the names of the cards in the lineup, the prices and approximate release date set to be in June 2017.  
  
  
Thats why you shouldn't trust wiki without looking at the sources. (cough Wccftech cough)
Maybe someone should update the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_Radeon_400_series#Vega) . "
