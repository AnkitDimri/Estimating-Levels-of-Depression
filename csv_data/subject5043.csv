0, I left it blank for the case beacuse it's your preference on what case you would want and I forgot the monitor 
1, I built you a system more powerful and for cheaper https://pcpartpicker.com/list/XnnZ8M 820cdn without case you should add a ssd or a m.2 ssd I threw this together in a a few mins so it may need a few tweaks to it 
2, I think it might be bricked it thinks it's a CD drive 
3, You can get a used gaming laptop laptop for about $500-$650 cdn I can send you a link to one 
4, Try re installing ram and the gpu if that does not fix t try your old card if you have it if it works fine with the old card your card came dead 
5, It's 2019 he can be a attack helicopter if he wanted 
6, I installed the driver for both my apu and gpu and it went blank screen and showed nothing so I re formatted my ssd and it fixed it but when you boot up before installing Windows disable the igpu if you don't have a igpu then this will not work for you 
7, we reposted it got removed in about 5 mins we just forgot the flair smh 
8, I was there it was funny AF I feel bad for the guy but its the best story I ever heard 
9, I was there it's funny af XD best story ever I feel bad for the guy but it's to damm funny 
10, Are the fans working now 
11, Possibly motherboard problems I have never heard of this if you have a spare on hand swap it out and see what happens if not try different fans 
12, Nice my 16 is on the 27th close behind you 
13, And thanks for the info 
14, I will take a break for a bit to see if it gets better 
15, I am going to talk to my consular about it and try to see what happens from there and I am going to slow down for a bit and take a break 
16, Yea I am going to try and talk to my consular about it and I am going to slow down on smoking for a bit 
17, Thanks for the info I picked up weed a few months ago but I had hallucinations and voices before I started smoking i don't get paranoid at all when smoking I am very chill and just stare into space but the voices don't get me paranoid i just listen but I never remember what they were saying 
18, Boneless chicken 
19, It's time for a crusade! 
20, Try to take out the bois battery and the laptop battery and unplug the charger and let it sit for a few mins then put the battery back in and the bois battery and try then or it could be that the fan is unplugged or it does not pick it up so it shuts off once it realised that the fans not there 
21, Looks like a skid mark 
22, He must be on that good good 
23, you can pm me anytime I am down to chat 
24, If you look about on eBay or Craigslist for a old gaming laptop like those thiccc ones and they go around $500-600 if you can get a little bit more budget you can pick one up with a i7 cpu navida gpu and around 8-16gb ram 
25, Look up how to de fragment your hard drive it will speed it up a bit 
26, it should work fine I do it all the time unless it's old it should work fine but just do a thermal stress test to check just run a few benchmarks  and check the temps during the benchmarks 
27, You could leave it there but if it gets worse bring it into a shop or use warranty to get it fixed 
28, That's to little to have built pc but if you want to go ghetto get a old desktop for around $100 and shove some ram and a gpu in but if you get  around 400-500 here's a pc that can handle most games for cheap but you could put a gpu in down the road and it will run anything https://pcpartpicker.com/list/2PnKw6 
29, Yea get it it's a good deal 
30, Looks like water or the LCD panel is on it's way out 
31, Get any gaming laptop and get a drawing tab to plug into it most gaming laptops don't have touch screens or you can look at some laptops with touch screen but does not run aswell as a gaming laptop I would look for something that has 8gb ram or more 4 core cpu I can't really give you a good gpu recommendations as I don't have much experience with laptop hard ware 
32, Just go up to the router and get your self a Wi-Fi booster and connect a wire to that to the booster and connect to the booster Wi-Fi I did that all the time when my parents blocked me I just connected to a booster and they never knew a thing or if you want to be a dick and you find the login info for the router on it and login on it you can unblock you're self or change pass words  if they all ready have not 
33, Keep us updated 
34, Don't know much about water coolers but I think that's just the pump inside it or it might be low on fluid idk I have never had a water cooled pc 
35, Ah shit here we go again 
36, Yea I will try too thank you for the input 
37, https://pcpartpicker.com/list/2PnKw6 made a parts list for u very good deal 
38, Good deal is to go with computers that use ryzen cpus I would look for a ryzen 3 2200g and 8gb ram 1tb hdd and the cpu has a gpu built in you can get a system built like that for around $350-400 very powerful for the price but you may need to find someone who can build it for you because if you don't have very good knowledge about computers it's very easy to break something 
39, Try doing a clean wipe of drivers you need a program for that tho to get a clean uninstall then reinstall the drives 
40, Not really unless your running lots of stuff at once and having lots of tabs open on your internet browser 
41, Did you try reinstall the cpu if that does not fix it the mother board is prob dead 
42, Try re installing ram or try to hook up to a other monitor and see if that fixes it 
43, Yea I might tell someone about it 
44, try re seating the ram 
45, yea I might try to talk to my schools consular about it but they would just tell my mom then the next time I am at my psychologist that the hospital I was at put my into a temp program to get me help only saw them once about 4 days ago but if I tell them they would prob admit me and send me off for observation or some shit or just think I am going thru a short period like this but this started a few months back then just recently I started hearing things I am a little out of it rn I have feeling like I am high a lot for no reason I have not used in months 
46, i might call some place like that thanks for the advice 
47, Try reinstalling the ram and does your cpu have a gpu built in if so try to run it off that and see if it works better or it might be the hard drive is dieing I would recommend doing a back up asap just in case 
48, The fan is most likely worn out it's a older card might be time to upgrade but it should work just fine for a while 
49, When yo chair gets haunted by ya dead uncle 
50, It's prob your Wi-Fi not able to put out enough bandwidth to the laptops I don't really know much about macs so I can't tell if this is a problem with the laptop itself or the Wi-Fi. it's prob the Wi-Fi 
51, I had a Acer aspire that  I thought it fried it's self just went dead no lights no charging lights at all but the fix was to take out the battery and the cmos battery and wait for around 10 sec then put it back together it might be your fix 
52, Yea then there would not be that spot in the middle that the image looks fine if it was a monitor problem that shows me that it's a hard ware problem with the computer not something with the monitor and even if he yanked on plugged in cords  it could cause them to stop working or cause the image to freak out or it would work like a broken charging cable but it would not do it like this and I have good experience with stuff that has broken HDMI ports  and it does not do anything like that I had a ps3 with a broken one my brother ps4 had a broken one and my brothers Xbox one has a broken one we had to unplug and plug then in all the time so that's what's caused them to break 
53, Why are you just going after the fact that he has rage problems it a %100 hardware with ram or gpu even if he did punch it. it would be clearly that the monitor is broken the monitor is fine and your just attacking him on his personal problems and blaming it on that fact he has have rage problems 
54, Try re seating ram and gpu plus the HDMI if that does not fix it your gpu is dead 
55, Yea good idea that's what I will prob use it for 
56, Pls post this on r/wellthatsucks but dann I would be pissed off they should send you a new laptop for the damages 
57, It came with my mom's new e smoke battery 
58, Our house has bad plug placement but we have plenty of cords. but this small like damm it's around the same size as my index finger 
59,  
60, And I am still a bit out of it most of the time when someone was talking to me I did not even know what they said I listened to them buts it's like I forgot what they said a few seconds later 
61, Yea I know but I am just checking to be sure and I don't really trust my phone to well but it's better then nothing it can give a ball park figure and when I was at the er my bpm was going up and down the range was 110-160 and they said my blood pressure was very high I forgot to put in i am getting aswell hallucinations I see something dash across the room and in am bed room in the dark I see like black sticks like spider legs around my room and the room does warp a little from time to time 
62, Yea I am on a very cheap budget and don't care about looks and the case is from a old win 95 workstation I found 
63, Yea I might get a second stick from my bro and in the future I might get something like a 970 or a 750ti 
64, It's going to be a Apu build so it will be a ryzen 3 2200g 8gb ram I will up the ram when ever o he the cash I am also selling my laptop for cheap so I can get the cpu and by the end of the month I will have more cash and get a 8 gb stick that's my plan for it and I do have 2 hdd there from old computers I have a 500gb sea gate 7200 rpm and this other one it might be the same drive i cant tell because its in a case that i will have to use  a saw to get it out but I know it works and I don't really care about to long loading times 
65,  
66, Some caps in the psu or on the motherboard went 
67, You NEED thermal past I am surprised your cpu is not dead get some good stuff too the stuff that comes with it you can use it but it's not the best 
68," I think you should get something like this

 sorry for the long link

69, You need a better cpu cooler it's not going to help much adding the other fan 
70, You can sell them for around $50 
71, Yea I have been feeling worse these past few days but I am but I have been talking to my consular 
72, my mom will only listen to my school about a lot of stuff and she might not even do anything i feel like taking my self but it feels like i am high but i did not take anything so if i go outside i will prob get lost 
73, i have not i am 15 so i would have to bug my mom but i cant bring my self to ask i had to get my friend online to call my school about my depression and suicidal thoughts and my mom does not really help with mental issues i almost called 911 when it started to have this happen i was freaked out i feel very off rn 
74, i would keep trying if it does not go anywhere admit your self to the hospital it might be the best place to go 
75, Yea thank you my school and my mom are not really helping at all it's good to know that I am not alone 
76, It might wine a bit I don't have much about water cooling but I would rec if you have a friend that is  good with computers take it to them  
77," Sorry for the late replay I got busy 
Is the pump marking noise does it feel full anything not the right color it may just need to be cleaned "
78, Or try a new pump and fluid that might be your problem 
79, No problem 
80, Or try replacing the fluid or pump 
81,  i would just try putting on new thermal paste get something med grade it will do you fine and if you don't know how to put it on get friend who does 
82, If your willing to go second hand I would look for a old gaming laptop you can find some with good specs around 500-700 or if your looking for new you should get somethings that has 4+ cores 10gb or more of ram and a few tb hard drive I don't know much about gpus in laptops you may need to ask around 
83, Plug in your cpu fan it's over heating do you have any thermal paste on is your fan running  
84, Here comes the airplane VROOOOOOOOOM  
85, I could not bring myself to tell anybody  I know irl about my depression and suicidal thoughts 
86, Next stop for you better cpu cooler 
87," Sorry for grammar and spelling on phone
And I can't put shit into words for the life of me

I will get a pic of the bike when I get home

I ride my bikecyle to school every day I was 14 at the time on my shitty bike it only had one working break and I was riding to school one day and I have to pass a elementary school that had a place to pull in and drop off your kids and I was in the bike lane going at a good speed but not too fast for the school zone and this ep pulls out of the drop off area doing a u turn to go the other way (there's sign every where saying you can't do that) and she pulls out and STOPS I only had about 2 seconds to slow down then I slammed into the car at not fast pace i hit the handle bars with my gut then I flew back and hit the tip of seat with my back and then I fall over I get up because of adrenaline and just book it after the car and because start to drive so she pulls over this is how it goes

Me: WHAT THE FUCK WHY WOULD YOU STOP

EP: IT YOUR FAULT FOR NOT STOPPING

I don't remember much about it because it was about 1 year ago

My mom was dropping off my sister and my mom pulls up after seeing my bike on the ground and she go up to me

Mom: What  happend 

Me: she pulled out and stop blocking the bike lane and I crashed into her I did not have time to stop
(My mom is a bit of a dumb ass when I comes to this kindive stuff)

Mom: well it's your fault for not stopping

Me: TF SHE PULED OUT AND STOPED I ONLY HAD 2 SECOUNDS TO STOP 

Mom:  JUST GO TO SCHOOL I WILL DEAL WITH IT

Me: fine I will go 

I go to the school office told them what happend they call the nurse and gave me a ice pack then that when the pain hits it was not too painful then I was told to goto class right after getting a ice pack I went into class sit down I am visibly in a bit of pain with a ice pack and my teacher asked what happend I told her she sent me back to the office told me to call my mom and to go home so I do that a ride home on that even more broken bike

So I go home and theres my mom I ask her did she be the info so we can make a claim she said no because it was my ""fault"" ( mom just did not care about me being in the right)

So I beg her to take my to the ER to get my back checked out she gives in and we go and I was told I was fine no x-ray or anything went back home and just sat in bed all day and my mom would not let me claim the crash and now I have back problems

Tl:DR so thinks it my fault for her pulling out and doing a u turn causes me to crash my bike and causes my to have back problems. "
88, Call cps or ask a friend to call if you can't do it yourself or try finding a watch dog group that deals with this kindive stuff 
89, I am not good at grammar it a developmental disorder 
90, [removed] 
91, I think her mom might be abusing her I would call cps just to be safe I have lost good friends of mine just drifted apart but shit like that is not normal from a person I know people from homes of abuse they kinda act the same way you try and find a away to contact her and ask if she being abuse she will most likely lie the first time u ask but I hope the best for u 
92, Yea Canadian can be dumb. as a Canadian I have seen few like the one person pulled out of a school drop off area and stoped blocking the bike path and I only had 2 second till impact into the car she blamed me (she was doing a illegal u turn and in a school zone with signs saying you can't do that) and my mom is a bit dumb in the head so she did not let me report it thxs mom for letting me suffer in pain ( I flew it the handle bars flew back and the bike seat slammed into my back) for someone being a dumb ass and letting them getaway with it

94," I love working on cars I am only 15 and could basicly do pretty much everything that could be needed for a car like breaks, belts, oil and tires .etc and I am good with electronics so I can fix those and I can weld (poorly but it better then nothing) I could be very useful in that setting "
95, I had a dream where I had no heart just a hole in my chest and I was walking around like nothing happend then I realise wtf i am missing a heart then I wake up 
96, Thank you I just have been thinking about how I could get out but sometime the bad thoughts comeout to mess with me 
97, Thank you I can't sleep tonight and I am trying to keep my thoughts off grabbing my pills and taking them with me to school and just taking them all I just can't stop thinking about how it would be better if I just gave up and just ending my pain been trying for weeks to get out of the big hole I dug myself into but i am having a little progress and keep falling back in 
98, I do it a lot too but I do it because I can't sleep 
99, It would be best for you to go get help i know it would be hard for you to go 
100, I don't have many people other then my dad that understands me he's done a lot of bad things hard drugs dealing guns went to prison he one of the nicest people I know I don't have a gf and I prob would not get one in time for this shit storm coming because I am just a socially awkward depressed 15 year old and just sits alone all day 
101, I want to give up in school too but you should tough thru high school at least my dad never made to high school and has never had a real job other then under the table I don't want go end up like my dad at my age getting into fist fights to eat his dinner 
102, Keep up the good work and you will see the day when you look back and say how did i let myself go this far 
103, If you don't know what to Do it's just best to call 911 
104, Do you know any near her 
105, I feel the same but I don't have any help people they don't see the depressed side of me they don't see me crying my self asleep all they see of me in just the lonely quite kid no one knows I go thru this I am getting to the point if I don't get help it not going to end well it could be tomorrow I snap or next year I feel like any day i could lose my mind blackout and never wake up 
106, I might have a very big trigger that will take me deeper down this hole. coming up in a few months my dad is severing my mom papers to get more visitor rights and I know she will flip her lid at me and if my mom starts to fight back she might end up in jail for takeing child support of child that was not in her care (it was my brother living with my grandparents)  I am hoping that it goes well so it does not affect me as much 
107, My cat has to watch when cook and she gets her own chair at the table to sit and watch us eat and if you don't let her on the patio she will meow at the door and flop over acting cute to go outside 
108, No balls 
109,  
110, Haha I would give gold but u I am dead ass broke 
111, he killed him self to escape the pain but you got to be stronger then him 
112, the internet because it my only place where i go to not be alone and it keeps me off my thoughts its the only thing  know. its the only think i see. its the only thing i hear is the internet calling my name when i am not there. 
113, you can talk to me i know your pain that you cant sleep i am all ways open 
114," i have been wanting to die for a long time but i could never do it my survival instincts kicked in a would not let me take that knife to my arm i have now brought my self back down into that hole if you are going to kill your self try to think do you really want to do it because you can never go back. msg if you need to and we can talk

 #x200B; "
115, For the price it not very good and vs a 1080ti 
116, Yea it worse then a 1080 for gaming  
117, Its prob the gpu or bad driver or bad ram 
118, Yea your ram if fucked easy fix just get new or try taking it out and putting it back in 
119," You could use
Something like a 1050 or a 1080ti ik it's expensive but it will last you a a long time before you need to upgrade

And dcs is a ram whore so I think you should get 32 gb if you have 4 slots on the motherboard just get 2 more of the same ram sticks you have
 "
120, You could use more ram but you might have a shit ton of malware or you just might best for you to reset your computer (reset it around 1 time a year) 
121, Woosh  
122," If she lays a finger on it just call the cops she won't bother you ever again 

It will save your ass in the long run if she touches it when the cops get there file a police report so its on record that she was trying to take your stuff and if she breaks it it gives you a LOT more leverage in court "
123," I would tell her touch my fucking computer I will call the cops and if she does touch it call them and enjoy the show and when they get there say to your mom welcome to the thunder dome motherfucker

 "
124,  
125," Its prob a cpu over heat or it is a unplugged cpu fan if it the cpu fan (this is different on most mother boards) it will shut off like it's lost power around the time you login into Windows or when booting up it will give a warning that the fan is unplugged then shuts off or boots up no problems
 ( I took apart my laptop to fix a problem and had to take the fan off and forgot to plug it in and it did the same thing) "
126, Could be a bad cap on there I think it's dead you might be able to get it fixed at a shop but they will charge you a arm and a leg so it better to get something like 1050  
127, Good luck for finding that for that price you would need to get a older laptop like mine with a quad-core i7 10gb ram navida 540m (My ram is upgraded) 1tb hdd if you look for a fixer upper with a small issue could get around that price the laptop that's good for that is a sony viao model pcg-81312m  
128, Thank you I will look at it 
129,  
130, Best thing for u to get next would be more ram around 16gb and a better gpu if wanted but your 1060 should be fine

160, That is so true 
161, It uses standard connectors on the board but there is other boards around there like adapters for the cpu water pump fans leds etc 
162, i got it for free without the power supply as my uncle who owned the psu died a few years back and the old gpu out if he replaced with 1080ti a few years back and the old 580 it not working well i have found the power supply for it online thxs to u all who helped me finding the right one
