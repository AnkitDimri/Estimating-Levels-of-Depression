my dumb brain = chest

1st pile of coins lower then chest = 50
2nd pile of choins under said pile =  1
3rd pile of coins bottom left = 500
4th pile of coins right side of bottom left = 10
so DIXL? but doesn't work? am i entirely wrong here? help lol "
118," yes but i'm stuck on what order. i have the letters right indicating the numbers, but i must be doing the order wrong :/ "
119,  
120," in regards to the quest with one of the puzzles, with the coins on the floor, how do you know what order to do the numerals? "
121," bit confused with the coins on the floor. i get it's roman numerals. but what order do you do the numerals? 
confused :/ coins are 50 / 1 / 500 And 10 so i wouldhave thought LIDX would have worked but nope

 (puzzle 2 if it helps) "
122," imo the original trim and comp capes are impressive because they have a nice looking simple design. maybe i'm just ignorant and don't like change much. 

maybe some of the ideas originated from this can go towards 200m capes or something even if it's cosmetic. "

127, It's nice when they do add more dyes for variety. As for Smoke I guess it's feasible. Maybe even a lava dye. Hope they implement a gilded dye   rainbow dye though just to see how it would look. 
128, it ended up turning out really well :) so im happy lol 
129, Also a klutz and very clumsy lmao so that makes me feel better 
130, 5 kids! Wow lol. But that's great you guys make time for fun still. That sounds like a good method. Were you nervous the first time doing that? A different place and all? 
131," He understands my concerns and goes at my pace. It's just me mentally processing it beforehand and being glad I have a platform to talk about my fears I guess. 

Yeah we communicate constantly so that's not going to be a problem. Just me having bit of confidence is the hard part. But knowing the right way to mention it also helps so thanks. "
132, It sounds like a fun experience lol :) 
133, A foreplay experience there does sound more easier. It's weird how I've been a bit hesitant but I guess that's just because it's something new being a different kind of situation 
134, We tend to have rough sex only because I enjoy it so much. But yeah we just go with each others pace usually. Yeah maybe pain killers might help. 
135," Our 1 year anniversary is this week actually and we do have a wonderful sex life in the bedroom. I cannot get enough of him lol.

Thing is we've mentioned shower sex a couple times now and I haven't been quite sure. I guess my own anxiety goes tenfold as I over think situations. But with a theme park trip and hotel this week, shower sex might be a possibility.

Not sure what I'm nervous of if anything, I love him very much and he looks after me I 25 f / he 34 m

i know i'm not going to change /
and you are wherever you are /
in that California paradise /

all i think about is emptiness of a friend and now whatever you are feels more and more like a question mark /

timid solitude but the waves are crashing /
my fury burdens me but i am forever lashing /
soon to be 26 and yet heavily undermanned / 

thinking of a day and night without fear or pain /
thinking of a slumber where i might reawaken sustained /
thinking of a sunrise that sunsets into quiet bliss /
a holiday doesn't suffice / a empty stones throw doesn't do this justice /

i'm looking for a answer that's scuffed to the max /
i'm pleading for forgiveness without knowing how to get up those steps /
i'm fearful of work and of working to the future /
i'm fearful of everyone and everyone's self expedience /

i bite away at all the lack lustre promises inside my head /
i feel like a structure that has titled and bent into oblivion's descent /

i feel like a magnetic magnitude of anger and wit /
i feel like a cunning lioness with a pitfall of guilt /
i am forever a blooming flower in the nightly twilight essence /
i am full of thorns, jagged edges and remain never fully understood /

i hate people / animals are innocent and kind /
i hate personalities like my own that clash with the obstacles named human kind /
i hate the parasites that swarm this earth / knowing i'm probably one too but nodding into the deepest depths /

Losing the Elite tectonic armour in dangerous PvP will result in a fraction of the original draconic energy being dropped on death, based on how degraded it was, rounded down. For example, if the robe top had 52% of its charges remaining, 218 draconic energy would be dropped on death. "

Nothing wrong with showing your feelings. Fuck those who think differently. I wasn't raised to be a sheep and from the looks of it neither were you.

I'm glad you're getting support. I have nightmares, take antidepressants daily and still have good days and bad days. Music, writing poems, getting feelings out is so good for the soul. 

I'm so glad your best friend was there at the right time. Whatever happens, I hope you will find yourself first, in the sense of self love, worth, and just to look forward somehow.

What it means to smile /
To have wrinkles under my eyes and blush /
To have flaming locks of envy /
To hold his hand under the stars 

Is this what it's like to believe /
To forgive and forget in his arms /
To be caressed and nurtured / 
To smile and fall in love "
400, Beautiful

402," Long-term heartland / background insanity /
Okay sounds like another stone to water / 
Patchy halfback / hint of crescent bluebird / 

Yeah morning was something I enjoyed a decade or two ago / back when the devilish horns were out of sight / 

Patterns reversed / pull back the preliminary heart / forget the quarter / forget the temptation

Stop callously grabbing at air / let go of the road of loneliness / forget the road that folds his clothes / breathing forward and focus on the memoirs to manage in a few hours / 

Heal me spiritually for you constantly remain in my darkest night "
403, Please don't kill yourself. I can't expect you to listen to a stranger. But it gets better. I know what heartache feels like and it's horrible. I'm sorry you feel so much pain right now. Internet hugs. : ( 
404, Kinda looks peaceful to me :c 
405," As fleeting as the week passes by /

All I know is myself / same old song and dance /

And yet the beat clamps down on its own irregular accord /

Wasn't life supposed to be perfect?

And yet after getting what I want, I still want more?

In the downtime of loneliness, of ones own destruction /

Set the fire out /
 ash turns to stone;

 stone ignition by Clementine / foggy leaves in the wind turbine, jetfuel impaired by science and radioactivity, /

Deserted by man, self induced by a coma of sin /

All is quiet but noise stills upon thy cheek / amber lack lustre on the cord of the ropes into the creek and crevice well before me /

Yet light fades through the black and I'm still here /

Friday; drained by anecdotes of pity /

Painful rouse of seething headlights / staring; blinking without respite / and yet onward to the next of kin / the road of the damned and the road of the sin

East to valleys / moons / the defiled and the noteworthy marooned /

Life remains withered / imperfect and red /
Red as the sun's birth and amber as the Sun's death "

Surrender to your hand / let me accept that you no longer need me / surrender to myself I miss you but it's over / I've been thinking about you in my dreams / but it's just lust like a miserable vine whip

Surrender to the point of no return / accept my new happiness is healthy and free without conflict /
Bite your hand away / forget you exist / maybe then I wouldn't have to bite my teeth "
410," So you hid some darkness of your past / I didn't give my truth until you told me mine / I hate myself for thinking about him again and again.

Tortured but not blind / I'm a monster in disguise / I am not disgusted by you / just a little disappointed by the wait. 

Daddy issues until the end / ceramic concrete / disdainfully unspent / horrific events in my life with unease / conflicting information about you and him / should I end towards my solo route or choose a castle that's been battered by opposition

I'm flawed as you are / deep within my head / mousey waters / fleeceless Brown / angry angels set fire to my stones / devil's advocate playing tag with my head / confusing reminders of newsflash hellsbent / 

25 years of 25 to life / when will the prison gates release my mind / dead as the darkness that drowns me in daylight / supress my quicksand until the limelight of respected distaste 

Aftertaste of a madman / birds sing and the owl hoots / shoot me to a plantation of peace / history / hellfire to solidifying memories. / hate myself to the ground and back / darkness impaired by blinding taillights. 

Is it so much to ask to be set free from my head "
411, Beautiful as always.  
412, okay. i really found this helpful thank you 
413, Well I appreciate that you liked it. I miss my ex even though it was a online relationship and I never met him. It's stupid because all we used to do was argue and have lust as our output. I miss him alot but time is the only healer in that :/ 
414, its eyeballs are mini galaxys D: 
415, thank you for a detailed reply. and a kind response. i am hoping it will be a longterm thing but if it doesn't work out that's okay. just want to do my best on my part as he's been so honest and upfront with me. 
416," We met on a dating site. He's told me his past which is quite serious and I can still see him for him. I've also mentioned how I have baggage from being bullied throughout adolescence. 

I smile alot, and am comfortable in his presence. But I just would like to know that my gut instinct is in tune with my heart. I'm not expecting miracles or anything. I know it's new, fun and well exciting in itself. 

But if anyone can guide me with some pro's and con's of a healthy relationship especially being my first one I'll really appreciate it. Thank you.  "
417, The pain...the relief o.o 
418, yeah. i would like to have my cape back without the pvm requirement such as reaper. but obviously i doubt it will happen. it's a nice idea overall though :/ 
419," 
This is new.

And fun.

And scary.

My eyes are open,
My stance is lighter,
I smile more,
And laugh often.

You give me chills,
And comfort in the darkness,
Freshly smitten in the lighthouses silhouette.

Defined by genetics,
Made several flaws,
Sacrifice boundaries,
Withdraw my walls.

War isn't so fiery,
Instead there is space for joy 
How wonderful to be allowed,
Time to enjoy oneself in,
The particular moment of freedom,
Of courteous demand.
In that he gives me a feeling of warmth. "

437," Depression and anxiety cuts deep in so many forms for different people. Some lucky folk have never experienced anything like it. Many hours have been put into this game. Like all doses of balance, it's helpful for some time out.


Escapism however in the long-term is never the cure. I found that out the hard way. Been getting counselling recovery sessions for the past 2 years and even with antidepressants, cbt, it's always good to walk away from scape if it becomes the sole access to escape. 

So young to have a stressful situation as you've found yourself in but I wish you a recovery. "
438," I know you are with her / somewhere in the dark / I know deep down you must love her / more then what we had

I have simon / you have your rose / I think of you sometimes / not with him though / I wish it wouldn't come to feeling like this / confetti aside / honeymoon bliss /

Simon is nothing.like you / simon is more / and yet at 2am / I'm thinking of you across the shore / not in desire but in envy / envy of what / which makes me question me

I never met you / I never will really / it was for the best / our online output ended with zest

Yeah it's time to give up on you / I just wish I knew how to feel less shit / thinking about you. "

First boyfriend I've had / do I call him that / too soon to tell / company is nice / we've kissed overall 3 times.

Overlook the ocean. / female to male connection. / 
The problem is / I've put up so many mental barriers over the years / been hurt quite bad / but he seems patient. 

He's not a looker / nor am I / yet he's understanding and quite peaceful / yet I'm so persistently obnoxious and vulnerable instead

Too early to tell / is he a keeper / I'm unsure
Don't know a red flag when I see one / but he's not controlling like my dad was to my mother. 

What do I do / do I see him again / or leave the darkness to fill my black head with negative energy again. I still feel scared / darkness impaired / 
But I sleep a little better "
461, beautiful 
462, thank you. alot. 
463, i'm to blunt in itself to pretend in any form. i just cannot fake my feelings. if im not interested theres nothing there 
464, im glad you have someone who understands you 
465, it's quite terrifying to have :( 
466," thanks. i guess the worst case scenario is him standing me up. or rejecting me, somehow, its weird what the mind does to make everything extremely negative when in reality it's probably a simple solution "
467,  
468, I do this alot. Then every now and again I'll be in a car journey and it'll go past a pedestrian lane without the steel bars/fences in the sidewalk. that has some flowers on it. And then you realize someone died there. Better to be safe than sorry. It won't always prevent an accident but sometimes crossing the road without a traffic lights option nearby isn't the wisest choice 
469, Just asking for the look of death really lol 
470, Now I'm thinking what if there ever was a seafloor staircase/hidden floor and a bunch of gold inside. Yeah I think I'm overthinking the goonies without the ship part. Anyway lol 
471, i had my first kiss. the date went alright. :) 
472, Probably lion king on sega or super Mario 64  
473, i'm not religious at all per say. i got bullied alot at school and honestly the comments have stuck. self esteem has been low for a while but i'm at the stage where i might as well try. i mean we only live once. 
474, Yeah. I'm not a fan of being insincere. I'm a honest person so I don't feel the need to pretend to be who I am. It doesn't really work well doing that.  
475, Yes folks and family know my plan tomorrow. Escape route is clear. That's the good thing. 
476, This makes me feel a little bit better. 
477, yeah. some red flags would be if it goes aggressive real quick or something along the lines of that. thank you for your detailed reply. 
478, thanks. 
479, yeah i just don't want to come across as clingy or weird. lol. i feel so nervous.

482, cheers. 
483," So who knew in 24 hours / I could give in and try something new. / Went on a dating app because what the hell, my heart was broke and I needed something else /

Just took one person / to be empathic and understand / just one person to be honest and not reprimand / so instead of being so terribly down, I have a date in the week later on. / 

If it goes well / I'd appreciate it. If it doesn't / such is life / back to burying my head in the sand. "
484," so you moved on, you lost your health, you have a new girlfriend and drink it all to hell.

i shouldn't miss you but i fucking do. i'm so bitter, loneliness is destroying me as usual.

i should be happy for you but the picture grits my teeth, you are smiling and i am obsolete.  

fat ogre on the shelf again is how i am feeling, ill in bed with a fever, being a hypocrite, grieving, i pushed you too far and now i pay the price. too little to late.  "
485, Lol yeah I'm not good at all but I just don't feel comfortable at the hairdressers so fk it  
486, Last line is painful. 
487, Yup it's gotten to the point I either cut me hair or let me mam do it cause then I'm not paranoid about what other people think and it's in the comfort of my own house. Also saves money really

489, Thanks for all the comments thus far. I really appreciate it 
490," support network is the only thing that'll keep you going. i was in your position for 4 years and it let to a mental breakdown. make sure you got family and friends around you. and if needed have a word with the doctor, be it counselling, or just that you're struggling.  "

No I am not pregnant (virgin) lol. Any advice would be wonderful. I was hoping to go swimming and now I'm worried.  "

609," Live with mam and stepdad. Stepdad's son has learning disabilities (age 21 but mental age is 10)

My life is considered spoilt. I don't cook. I barely do anything. I play games and I live on benefits because I can't cope. 

I was vigorously bullied at school and have nightmares to this day about them. Moved away from hometown a decade ago and still can't get on with life. Live in countryside. Should be at peace. Definitely not.

Over 20k hours playing a mmo since 04. Barely play it but it says alot about what I've missed. Virgin, cannot be bothered. 

I see people who are my age having kids, in a career and growing up independently. None of it seems worthwhile. Dog turned 6 yesterday.

I colour in books sometimes. I live near the ocean but it's cold. I take daily antidepressants to keep going.

My mam is alive. My stepdad survived a heart attack and triple bypass surgery. I am not. I've never dated a guy except online. Cringe but it's something.

I wake up and hate myself. I go to bed and hate myself. So much fear these days. I'm selfish and manipulating. I am quiet with rage built from years of pain. I stress over the littlest things. I have one friend my age I see every few months.

I literally cannot be happy nor bothered. Here I am. Little miss princess bitch ranting in bed after another nightmare. I don't even want to ask for help. I am stuck in my ways. Might as well become one of the normies and get this thread buried like I bury my head in the sand.

the game is what you make it, and seeing as aside from the xp caps to 200m per skill, you can really do whatever you like, i suppose that's where the enjoyment of runescape has always thrived upon; being able to do whatever you want in the moment. i still wish there was more content this year. so far it's been pretty scarce, but yeah. reaper is easy money too.

(brutal rant but from a players perspective)

i find some j-mods genuinely care about the status of updates and the core game. these collaborate with neutral feedback and others are not so set about tweaking content they've made.

apologizing only works so many times and frankly, it's almost become a weekly thing. there is something wrong WITH THE WAY IT'S BEING DIRECTED IMO.

how many sorry's is going to fix the game though? being vocal about it in a direct video is some indication of feedback. we love this game, we care about it enough to complain when we can see what it should be. is the bar too high? when we look at the history of updates, and how overtime, the amount of fixes from content that is game-breaking, that isn't properly coded, has to surely be changed, not just talked about. 

damage control isn't necessarily a fix for change. it's a step in the right direction but as it's a common thing now i don't know what to hope for. i just want updates without a hotfix every-time there is an update. is that too much to ask?   "

rs forums being censored/ruled by the top pyramid (j-mods/rs 'forum mods' (power hungry rule targets)

I am very aware our community can be toxic but over the years there have been alot of diamonds too. Runescape has been an escape and a saviour. No other game has brought the amount of joy and sustainable motivation to keep playing. And to see the day that I acquired a completionist cape. It gave me something to focus on that wasn't destructive.

Here's a little poem. Cringy or not who cares.

Thanks runescape.


Time has passed /
Quite quickly too /
A shadow of misadventures anew /

Back before the glory page /
A simple island designed by fate /
Illiterate noobs at the gate /
Kids, teens, adults alike /
Bots / trees / pixelated daytime /

Time progressed /
As did age /
Secondary school was met /
With bullies and rage /

Sadness and isolation was commonplace /
Yet I'd run home from school /
To a welcoming place /
A place to laugh, have fun /
Not feel like the only one /

Some regret playing so young /
Not I, as it had been the only one /
Rejoiced feeling like I was accepted /
Sick and tired of feeling tormented /

There were nights that were overcome by tears /
Fear, misery and alot of jeers /
Yet here I could woodcut for hours /
Chill out and skill, feel empowered /

Over a decade has passed since school /
Still enjoying scape for good /
The bullies have gone /
Yet my nightmares stay /
I'm beginning to think /
They'll never go away / 

Thank you runescape / 
I thank you most /
For your still here /
To relieve my haste /

Good and bad days yes /
But I do try my best /
Thank you for all the years /
No more tears drowning in fear /

Someday I hope my cloud will leave /
For now I will live day by day /

Thank you runescape.

946," It was constructive feedback mr swearbox. Get over it? Just because I state my opinion you want me to hush up. Sorry I don't do that to anybody, especially an individual as rude as you. 

It isn't just cosmetic items, it's the principle behind it. I'm comped if that means anything to acknowledge there is more to the game then this event. I'm expressing my disappointment.  "
947," necessary or not, it would be nice to have the opportunity for the option of receiving tokens outside of said area. hell even daily challenges, if it's 5-10 then it's something isn't it. 

it would be nice to see them to go above and beyond to make up for it - not just 5 x rate of tokens/sorry *no xp changes/any other kind of status but thanks for the response either way. "
948," i think what this new plan is, just isn't adequate to make up for yesterday. perhaps give us scapers 100+ (everyone - f2pers included) tokens/tickets as some kind of refund/benefit of the doubt?.

it would also be nice to earn a minimal amount whilst skilling/slayer etc. i get it's a fair. it just isn't very satisfying to bother with i suppose. idc about being downvoted, i just say how i see it, some might think well they've U-turned. just not enough for me to be content i suppose? "

978," Hits home as my stepbrother has global learning difficulties so on the outside he looks like a normal 20 yr old but on the inside he's about 10.

 More so worried about his innocence of the world vs me knowing how corrupt and evil anonymity can be.

It's a struggle also having anxiety and depression myself but don't let people get you down. Just do you.

I have always found runescape to be a safe haven irrespective and regardless of the people that play it. 

However yes it's truly difficult to trust people especially on a social platform but it's hard to trust people in all walks of life.

Baby steps is the best option. I say you and everybody is welcome to rs. Some abuse that right but if it's serious enough, consequences will remove    said players from the game (harrassment/extreme threats etc)

Good luck and I wish you the best. "

996," Shockingly I have had a similar situation. Lass from peterlee asked if I was ok. (Mental breakdown aug 2015) I said no.

Advised me to a doc for sicknote and told me there's further help available. Thank you.

Had a psychiatrist, cbt, thorough counselling and every day is a struggle. But this lass gave me a opportunity to feel human. To seek answers to why I felt shit all the time. Why I had anxiety getting out the door and the constant negative attitude.

 Sertraline here too. 200mg/daily and it's still a long way to go. But people like her aren't just ticking the boxes. They care. "

1020," 
Hear this out. It's an idea but this might work. Have a read.

As they've brought a t.a.r.d.I.s into the game. Could redo a mini tutorial with a penguin, hinting at quests, start out at lumbridge, somewhat small flashing arrow towards outside of the castle, has a right click skip option for quick access to the game.

The tutorial would involve said penguin (ping and pong for humour perhaps) who give you a penguin screwdriver. You are led to the penguin tardis which you use the penguin screwdriver to open it. 

Said tardis would feature a few portal's. No requirements, more of a visual if the player wanted to. 

Portal one would be access to tutorial island before it was put under the sea.

Portal two would be a bit like gnome-copters/ more of a pretty HD visual having interactive use of looking around each city/main area/anything to show the variety and true beauty of the game. Again only if the player wanted too.

Portal three would have a room of all the beginner npcs gathered outside lumbridge castle grounds, examine texts, all the basic lumbridge resources, trees/interior/exterior to show the player the general consensus of what most areas will look like.


This penguin screwdriver would have a easy-to-use wearable faq for new players which would remain a cosmetic item.  "

1025," Depression is pretty much the on going issue, anxiety has been since childhood. Frankly I don't know what I need. What does 'need' mean truly.

Considering I am lucky to live with a bed, food, for now my mam is alive, a dog, 

Needs are met by my dose of daily sertraline, but I suppose I wish I could get out of this rut. Where's the magic wand or sonic screwdriver or bernards watch to let me chill.

Lol sadly reality is brutal at the best of times. Struggling for me is a continuous morning of a cuppa, sorrowful lying on the floor with my dog, talking out my weekly counselling to me mam, and still feeling stuck no matter what.

Ide like to be cured but I don't think that's possible :) so realistically? It's hard to say. Being on a budget? Or dreaming of anything regardless of the cost. Welp I'm rambling. Lol.

I'm at the point I'm beyond looking at crossroads, it's just a mere scribble of black. Turning 24 this year is kind of scary too. It's amazing what people expect of you if you look normal on the outside, if they only saw my head, welp.  "

1038," Maybe try nox bow an make sure you've got death touch bracelet/amulet/ring of death, also maybe get a mazcab scroll to unlock the op ability, so worth it.

why must i be stuck in your hatred that yields /
demonic almost but why can't i be free /
i hate you for all your misery you have put in me /
i can't enjoy the sun /
i can't enjoy the light /
when in my head it's anxiety and doomsday fluctuating in my gate /
i hate you dad /
no blood of mine /
disregarding me; disowning me twice /
well you monster; you've not won yet /
as much as you've liked to have guessed /
you've produced only a fear but not a truth /
my heart instilled isn't an illusion; it's not obtuse

see harry (pet dog) 7 years you may be gone but you showed me delight /

i miss you so much but you were my life /
some say you were only a dog /
keep the memory and stay away /
but you were the remedy of my pain /

i may have nightmares /
i may have tears /
but i am young still /
and trying not to fear.

i hate the crowds /
i hate my mind /
i may hate you but your hatred isn't immortal

however you continue to wish throughout my head /
i know i am loved, and continue to be loved instead /

i wish my subconscious leave; exit in delight /
resist losing my mind to your doubts /
but father please know this /
although you may not know me /
i still try to resist /

people say forgive and forget /
but the damage is done /
isolation and loneliness wasn't made in a day /

no longer will i feel in guilt of the escape /
that was led because of your monstrosity of hate /
forgive and forget /
i don't understand /
religion seems foreign /
memories and love seem stone /
i realize i am not here forever /
but forever i am in this cage of fear /
it isn't my fault / 
i wasn't afraid when i was born into this sphere /

they say the world is your ocean /
but my eyes are the sea /
i would like to feel released from your misery /
and yet as i type i think of my mother /
my sister, my niece, my uncle and brother

for as much as i feel trapped /
and as much as you would like me to leave (self-doubt) /
i have a dad twice the size of your cage of doubts /
not in blood but a angel of love /

sunset and the sea /
didn't think I'd live the ocean by twenty-three /
trying to be happy /
is a tardis of strings /

although love hasn't set me free of your toxic waste /
i am reminded of my love from a freedom gate /
acid may burn /
nightmares may sting /

I wonder sometimes if drowning would hurt? /
Options and crossroads; it's all the same shit
How will I fly if I cannot get out of here /
I look at the sky and I wish I could see /
Except all that's here is foreshadowed misery /

I deny myself a physical smile, and yet I question these delusional miles. Thornes inside my captivity /
Digging under me and yet people feel better without the noise.

No. /

An apples eye /
Understand my fate isn't according to your woes /

Time stands when you begin and when you end /
Yet I'm the lighthouse of eternal suspended wit /
Rotate your clock /
Do what you must /
For I am the lighthouse /
For all; unjust /

Fiend or friend /
That is uncouth /
For in twenty-four hours /
Your mission is replenished /
I will stop /
Only by the sun /
Or when eternal darkness /
Is accompanied by one /
For treatment and treasures are spellbound by fate /
Greed, disdain...unfortunately late /

For when the sun explodes with trickles of starlight /

Perhaps then I shall decompose /
Or if fast fate settles /
Perhaps the time will be /
That the lighthouse of myself /
Will be sent to the depths of the sea /

Glorified and turned to ash /
perhaps my fate is sealed from the backlash /

You never see the other side until you are wise with regret/
Perhaps Saturn's rings could enlighten some magic yet. "
1117," Foremost a withered spine /

it became so soon /

that all that's here /

is really meant to be /

as i contemplate confusion /

at every crossroads arrowhead tree /

prayers are seldom /

but yet here i am /
staring at the sea again/
hoping for a little sunshine/

in my own bubble of mine/

aloft in the loneliest primetime/

where technology progresses at such a speed/

that only we can breathe after a calm cup of tea/

nightfall looms overhead tonight/

lost in thought/

of a previous lifetime /


not of worry nor care /

but with a childhood head. /

lost yet found /

within myself /

not needing one  /

to sustain my wealth /

sleep tonight /

young butterfly /

wisp the willows under the buttercups of twilight/

 /
let the shadows shimmer /


and the dust turn to ash /

we can be winners /

if we all but relax / "
1142," random poem that came in my head /



and so it is /
another night of /
quiet silence /
yet loudness in my mind /
although it seems bleak /
as the sun fades to black / 
remember tomorrows another day /
so don't fear the end /
as tomorrow brings a new light /
let strength come up and soar /
you through your hopeless /
and be rejoiced and sing the song of a lullaby /
such a group like this can bring /
joy in spite of tragedy /
a holding hand along the pain /
and let's move past aprils rainy days of bleaky pain/
so soon bright may will be /
or june /
or july /
or august; old summer memories? /
whether it rains /
it snows /
whatever the time /
a friend is someone who is there /
and that can be the biggest comfort /
of a lonely mind / "

intricate sparks situating over a forgotten silver skyline |
shattering shades of Saturn, my blues are not evading |
your intimacy is neither here nor there, yet i love you all the same |

times are ever changing in this fast paced airwave |
i look above and see the oval paradise of twilight; 
yet i see blackness and misery awaiting my fortnightly incomings. |
not only are you lost, boy but i am lost too |
except you're a man now in your puddles of mild-mannered consciousness |
And yet i bloom like the sun under your company, fickle like a rosy mistletoe that's ready to sleep. |
weary, my friend i am tired.
not of you but of my own regret; of a cowardice profound like no other. sick of comparison and sharing!, |
sick of my own innocence, prejudice and disbelieving! |
sick of hate, almighty justice, encompass me upon this thistle-bud and show me compassion, i am tired of waiting. "

If there is something like this could you put me in the right direction. I am very broke so I hope it doesn't cost a horrific amount. Please be kind, and please don't troll. It's quite upsetting when I can't find them as I kind of panic. Thanks.  "
1151," I've had reoccurring nightmares from my school years im always about 14, always a different episode. Almost always particular bullies are in different scenes. Most of my dreams involve people that had bullied me but they seem like my best friend or talk to me or we run around the school. Im talking 30/50 different episodes as different people up to this number had bullied me in that particular school. I am 22 now and sometimes these dreams are 5/7 nights a week, sometimes once a month and sometimes once every 3 months...obviously this has happened for about 8 years now. I iust wish I knew why they keep egging at me/haunting me. Very upsetting "

my trying has extinguished and the will is gone/


i want justified happiness in living/

it's not frightful, it's terrifying/

this midnight calling, tragedy from the morning light
enlightment isn't all but a housed terrice here/

this monster doesn't remain under the bed
it's there stalking passively/

this blackness deepens the best of us/

yet some lucky folk seem so lucky and transferred into positivity/

yet i have is undoubted misery and mercy/

my question for this apathetic life is : when the mercy will run out?

/
long overdue is my responsibilities yet here i am laying on the floor again/

24 hours of nothing changing/

and all i really needed was acceptance/

empty house/empty phone calls
/noone comes/

let it end and let it be/

noone deserves this stupid idiocy
that is called loneliness /

but alas my addiction stays/

in these 4 walls/

day-to-day/


wake me up pill to numb my misery/

take me home i hear you cry/

become normal and smile it's alright/

you are not alone it's okay/

just pretend lass- tomorrows another day/

1156," Absolutely one of my childhood favourites. I find it a great comfort as I did as a child. As it's written towards a child friendly audience I only hope people knew more about this book. The story has a quick flow. happy in some moments and also a tear jerker. I don't really see people mentioning this so I only hope others did find comfort in this book although it was over a decade ago. Itself as a book just has a pure quality of imagination. The story, the characters stay with you.  "
1157, I've been on sertraline for a few months now and it certainly helps a tonne. I used to cry very much and have alot of panic attacks.

Yet I see stars resting unrestricted above me overhead and a burning star for a sun that sits within our sky and I see the beautiful pattern of organic organisms of their daily cycle and then I see our betrayed genes, a language that kills with money, lust that cheats with hate and manipulation that seeps with religious virtues. Bitter, my youth hisses with doubt, for present pride doesn't reside here and I remain inclined to seek a purpose. But dad you aren't here, and my road has twisted yearning for your response but for you I am a nuisance.  "

So much to think about that tomorrow's fate is deciphered by yesterday's conflict of misery and change.
Youth's trust in an account of misinterpreted eye's. So long ago it was that I fought for my rights, a game of cat and mouse. Deluded in those crimson days. Looking now in 2016 I am afraid of tomorrow. Bitter of the past without sorrows. Forbidden keeper that time has no hold.
Lockdown on one's only accord. For loathsome heartbeats never formed in a day.
Tumble thimble, naughty whimsical lunatic humanist interval. Close the door and let me sleep for I burn without peace. Owners of decay and tired eye's. Let me wake without fear tomorrow's night. Sleeping willow of a thumb. Surely I'm not the only submerged one?  "

For I am numb without freedom.
I long for things I don't possess
And as I grow I weep, as it scares me
This everlasting freak. 
Pittance and perpetrated wrinkles surrounded by sinister shadows lurking in the deep.
This madhouse of my head is not a minefield of melancholy
Except when im alone but thoughts escape me.
Selfish and undignified
I look for non existing right
I am so afraid of the night.

Another annual anonymous saddle monster

Hate myself, shallow girl.

And when I am unobliged I am guilty?

How bitter and twisting time remains, for what purpose is mine?

Ashamed; I must be. 
For I am tired of not gaining.

My last resort is giving up. Cowardice to get money in this way. To resort to pills ... neither tranquil nor redeeming for I am jaded with unfeeling. Exceptions of loss, I am young but gone.

i wish for her to return but she never does, who is she? amanda's joy. this lighthouse of home santuary and fear is stuck and preventing her now. tip-toeing and subliminal messages from the media eradicate her. make her not found. for all that is there is gone from her heart. all is left is this fucking black cloud on her chest. and all that remains is waking up old being too late. fuck depression.

shop windows are searching for your money
the win dows are cracked and the facade of greed is everywhere
beggars sit beside the outer porches as they have done since dawn.
caves, train tracks, limosines
war, generosity of ill genoside,
ill hearted racism
where is the paradise?
whom be the teacher is the lessons are taught wrong
caught in decision where do I belong?
caught into the world where technology advances us
imac's and commercialism
prodding retail sweatshops
disnowned father-daughter love
mind numbing topics designed to hate ourselves
a community which co-operates on funds
where did selflessness go?
why are we so numb
 is it in our toothpastes?
is it our lack of funds
are we denominated by our prime
from choices our descendants made
have we no name in ourselves
do we decide a changing game
or do we give up, not in gods name
god did not exist when i was the beholder
did we lie to ourselves to manifest a dream beyond our
mildy matters of pearly gates?

and back yet again

stuck in the clouds
like a mindset of qualified knowledge -

and i am vacant.

as i wake up yet again in the same old cloud
day in, day out unprecedented loss
i cannot focus, i am numb
 "
1197," unconventional madness.
it really fucking is. i applied for over 4000 jobs all day everyday. and to get to this point. the future is bleak and i cannot escape what predicament this is. i need help and don't know what to do. it's 2am and i either go to work unable to work or i don't go to work and seek help. why am i so afraid to seek help.

why do i come to the internet? to feel anonymous when it most likely isn't.

as a child my dad emotionally abused me, and did weird stupid things. nothing too sick but sick enough to be a tormentor and probably why im the way i am

many reasons why im stuck in the past...

he'de tickle my feet till i cried, to laugh, for about 10 minutes
(between ages of 4-8)

he took me to a butterfly sanctuary and laughed as i panicked as they flew in my face. i was three. butterflies (stupid right) scare me if i'm near them. beautiful creatures but i panic if they go near me.

when him and my mother were together if we wanted to go shopping he'de have the audacity to ask her for petrol money, he was the income holder, mum was living on income support due to a long-term back injury

he'de lie about taking me places and agree in front of his mates that we;de go together so i'de assume as a kid with false hope i'de go, mind this doesn't bother me now but it did then
(aka superficial things like disneyland/lapland/pay for my new york end of school leaving trip)

he'de betlittle me and my mother but mum didn't wake up until i was about 12 and only when my dad hit her she left with me to move away but by then it's been too late. moved away at 14.

22 now...and since we left him the following has happened.

been playing runescape since i was 8 to deal with it;

i write random amounts of bullshit poetry to escape as my mind is affecting me from backend trauma

i listen to music to heal but after the music stops i'm back to reality

dated online boyfriends all my life. never experienced anything real. i mean if a skype call is real you can call that real but it's a shallow petty route. 

i'm afraid to seek help, i'm afraid to talk to mind or a doctor, i know i'm probably going to, but i know it feels so late, i'm in destruction phase and don't know how to get out of my rut. 

my dad is about 68, why can't i forgive him, the words forgive do not work, i've cried for years, tormented myself to let go and move on, yet he's still there in my head.

this job is fucking incredible and i'm fucking it up. i don't want to do it anymore. i don't want to be on the dole anymore, i just want quietness, no more getting up at 6 and getting home at 6-7-8pm
yes people do this everyday and petty me for not being used to it, 

sigh, i just want someone to love me, and i want my dad to be someone else, and he will never change, why do i expect him to wake up and see everything he's done, why do i come to a narcissistic platform that jumps on every woman's trouble?

well the answer is i'm a coward, coward as they come and i don't know what to do anymore, i just want to feel safe and i do not feel safe, safe as in sanctuary, i miss home, i miss moments of not panicing, but i don't remember the last time i did this...

if someone understands any of this bullshit please let me know?
because i feel i'm venturing lost and yes i'm rambling but who can i talk to? a doctor to get a pill? to altar my hormones and make it all ok as in a petty hush hush?

i'm just lost. and i know the only way to heal is to help yourself, and i know you can't drag a horse to water and all that shit. but i feel like 12 still, in a womans body with a womans mind. i mean fuck im nearly 30 soon and i have nothing except the love of my mother, she's been my rock and i don;t know what to do

:/ tdlr...sorry needed to vent. can't sleep, restless thoughts and dunno how to help myself anymore

18
19 creeping up
let's find a job; oh no i cannot.
apply, apply apply 4000 times
job does not come, i am numb i am numb
throughout you are here and i still play you
lost in my mind
to sanctuary of music and a numb gaming mind.
2014
volunteering
xmas
spit's in face
paranoia
15 may 15
opportunity comes
chance in a life time
8k apply and i get the job
2 months in and i crack up
i still go but my mind is all over the shot
so much fear in my head
wanting to be alive but i think back to the times i was living on 57 a week to survive
and now i earn so much i dont know what to do with it
wildfire
cutting fibres
breaking all my loose ends
i just want to be a success
but i am stuck in jersey dreams
on the same game
talking to a jersey king
not real but in my head
i can pretend and he is there
i love him
but as time vanishes
i do just slumber in my head
as i am lost.
  "
1201," childless, timid and lost.
could i face another day of torture.
i long to let go from your clutches, years have passed but you linger
all day, everyday, in my head
in the dark
at night when i slumber,
in the forest of my nightmares
walking with me in my dreams, but you are not here now.
you're still on this plane but you're battered and bruised.
and now the tides have turned and i am empowered,
but i remember the agony and i am a lost little girl.
where are you daddy? i would like to know now.
not the daddy i remember, but the daddy that doesn't exist
the one that comes to rescue mother and me, and take us to sanctuary
not belittle us with your manipulation games,
except now i'm the warrior
i work 50 hours a week and what do you do?
disengage with your fellows at your local
wishing it'de come back
do you not realise i remember the pain
do you not understand i wanted a friend
without your role, i have no bounds
im on my own, tormented by you
i wish you forgiveness and love on your way
but even though you're retired
that lost little girl still wants to play
princess and have games
but you prod and poke and torment me
tell me off
dad im 22 now, please wake up
i know you'll never change but i'm half a female
i want all of your love 
you want all of my misery
please let go and one day see
that i could be someone,
not a empty threat
why did it take till 22
to wake up and see through you
that i could be the brave one
and go beyond your expectations
how is a dad meant to be dad when he's a bully?
one day i'll let go
one day.
 "
1202," change is coming, change is new.
i have no power, my mind is blue.
new roads today, tomorrow and unkind foes.
these foes do not speak and these foes do not take lightly.
these foes weep, and shriek.
the kind of foes that spill beneath the bedsheets.
time is work, time is money,
my time is going and i have no money.
no money to understand.
no wealth in the understanding of money.
i have money today but it has no feeling.
like i could buy a.
bicycle and it wouldn't faze me.
tired eyes, sunday blues
can i relax, no it's monday too.
tuesday, wednesday
not my head day
maybe thursday
friday curiousity
panic saturday
blue moping sunday
oh wait here we are again
will time save me
no i suppose not
not when im against the clock
 "
1203," blue stars, twilight.
i wish i knew, i wish i might.
is it tonight i will find?
or is the magnifying glass skin deep?

Bright eyes, tonight's the night.
pain and change, brave face. 
dreams are closed yet the book is open.
the page begins where youth is.

i wonder if the lines of the tracks near the compass where the bridge begins ends soon or was it a lost maze waiting to happen.
what a lost cause  it will be if the misery took hold ahead of the agony to progress.
what road is mine?
 "
1204," pull the rain,
open the window and let the light in,
smell today and breathe the sea air,
today is Saturday and they cannot touch me.
fall beneath the white cackles of the fortress above,
the fair maiden is in resting slumber beneath the essence of the jagged rocks.
let me sleep. "
1205," seriously. when do you ever see a player use them though. cmon ninjas, use some of your ninja magic?  "
1206," if i said i wanted to become the girl i dreamed of being
would you listen from the depths of the shallows of where those dreams were formed?
long before the isolation set itself;before she acknowledged the reality
of her situation
long before the architecture of the cynical lies set in?
would she no longer hold herself onto the mannequin of self doubt?
and find carefree space between her soul?
or would it all had been a facade all along, transporting herself along the road, walking to a lighthouse
to seek herself when no answer would come?

many days are lost in my emotions, i've always wanted more then i deserved because of you.

why did you hurt my heart so badly, i wish you nothing but love.
it's for the best they said, move on they said.

i long to come undone and someone change my pattern, where do i  go from here when i have been searching for years. now i understand i am on my own and no man yearns for the things i crave. i seek understanding but they see lust in other women.
i seek formation of forgiveness, yet i no longer know how to forgive.

will my butterfly whispers save my darkness
and will i become the woman i set myself to be in past's decay?
or will i become lost in ancient wounds from enemies deploy
and fall into gloomy shadows of despair

please help me from those haunted woods
let the rain fall and become a echo of a land that sets me free
and let the pain from my fallen take me home where they are ok
and i understand that they will be looked after
heaven or not
hell or not
ashes or not
despair or not
let the silence of the last noise and breaths they take and be remembered for be not in vain; i miss you so much and you're always in my memory

even yesterday for another that this world never catered for
i hope you will rest, in whatever slumber of non pain,
rest for i do not know how to care for the left behind
as i am in my own suffering.


 "
1207," tickety tock
hours lost
weeping sorrows down
frowning today
wishing away
years of childhood.
conker games
pokemon friends
innocent pretends
smiles and imagination
now todays a new phase
and i don't know where it leads
but i am vicious with the stray est of withered ends
i have wasted time
and these hours are mine
but i still have no idea where it leads
i wonder if it's worth it
that i will surrender my curses
and fall beneath the willows with old friends
give me a summer night
for i am lonely and undecided
and time isn't my friend these nights.
anxiety is my foe, but i am rustled with woes
maybe today joy will come
for i do not want
to be seventy-one
and say my life was a sore one.
please say you will come
to save me once again
to be my friend and suggest that i'm ok not ill in the head.
new horizons not mine,
barriers undefined,
just want someone to hold my hand. "
1208," i was unemployed since i was 18 and i was until may. 

May decided to be a month that would change my life in many ways.

i recently turned 22 and what happened in may was quite astonishing to say the least.

firstly though i want to explain my mindset which leads me to why i am so exhausted. when you are unemployed and young, you assume opportunities are going to come within 6 months. but they don't come and assume well, it's not going to happen yet, so you do what you can and live on 57 a week. you do this for 5 months and you see no difference, eventually it wears you down except you cannot escape the fortnightly signing on's to survive.

so you try to approach it differently, you wake up in the same pattern but time slugs on mournfully like a forgotten dream. sundays..mondays, wednesdays, saturdays on and on and on. without direction patterns fluctuate except the very same building to sign on to. only it gets worse as your peers start assessing the situation and assuming, well surely i'm choosing to be unemployed. i'm choosing to apply for 32 jobs a week apparently. xmas comes and you feel great the first year, thinking a new start, a new me...except by march you feel disillusioned and put on the shelf, it's as if you have a stop sign in front of you and that stop sign halts your pathway, you however have to continue living with this stop sign, so instead you compare yourself to other people, try to keep a mindset whilst surviving, but after four years it really isn't ticking the way it did on the first 3 months, by this point i was almost having a nervous meltdown every week, i had anxiety each and every day and oh, haha...i still do. 

but yes anyways

May 2015.

i'm signing on as usual. my jobsearch helper introduces me to a government job opportunity. except it isn't any opportunity, only there are 200 places and it requires a 250 word statement as a starter to even progress to the second round.

and i puit my heart on that form, i explained quite thoroughly what my situation was, not remaining negative but being honest. so honest in fact that they must have loved it because i got accepted.

only now my issue is i work fulltime but i have anxiety, anxiety of the after effects of being unemployed for 4 years and i feel very small. i had my first paycheck, my first proper one. and i feel guilty, i don't know why i feel guilty, but i feel guilty for earning a wage which doesn't feel right but i do feel this way. 

i have made friends at work. but i am so lonely. i feel like a coward and want to hide from this opportunity, but i know i must face it as there is no going back at this point. so i will succeed or get fired. i just wish i could be brave to not panic at weekends, as the little spare time i do get i am thinking about work, and not thinking this is me at home, i do not need to worry about the past. 

it's a sunday afternoon and i need to rant. as i do not want to have panic attacks in front of colleagues, but i feel so behind wheras they have all travelled the world and been in similar roles, wheras for me i  have not.   so yes i shall pity party and i don't know what i will do when this opportunity ends as it's only 2 years, i just hope i will manage.... "
1209," i was unemployed for a long-time, this opportunity obviously has changed my life but I'm not entirely sure what to do with it. necessities like rent, food and work clothes are a priority but i will still have a remainder, my mam raised me not to participate in getting debts so i have none to pay off. but I'm afraid of spending it all at once also. if anyone can understand where I'm coming from please help. 

although i would like to aim towards a holiday as i only have had one last year and that was the last one I've had in seven years.

edit; if it helps i will be earning 18k a year/ monthly payday "
1210, it seems quite useless for what it is and there are constant complaints about it. lol probably get a response saying go to runelabs -.- 
1211,  
1212," would be a great addition, also with halo's in mind, can they become part of the new minigame thaler reward please? "
1213," so it seems everytime i post something, the next thing i post theres a timer issue. i barely use reddit as it is and it's at the point i might quit reddit soon if it's not sorted. too annoying really; 

http://gyazo.com/9843e0622af096695a8b8744d7d8c176

just what, i posted one thing, i didn't do anything else -.- "
1214," where to start. do i start with a number? an age to prove some subtle point that i'm existing in said year and have breathed x amount of times? i don't know.

do i say i'm an atheist to expect logical answers and no calling for ""prayer"". or do i say i want to sit at park benches. but when i do i feel that was pointless as it's still the same road I've looked at since 14 from moving house and nothing changes.

do i say i believe i'm bipolar and i hate mondays. lol

hi. i'm Amanda. i'm 21. it's dull but complicated. complex yet simple.
i'm lost in the world. i live with my parents, i have addictions. I've wasted my education into the ground. i'm unemployed and live on the state money to survive. it's been like that since 18. i don't see a light at the end right now, suffice to say i can only blame myself.  

i just want to admit in the space of darkness, hi world. i'm a coward to you all. you all come and go, have your road trips, adventures, someone to sleep with at night, and i envy you most, i envy courage and i envy the fighters. the ones that haven't lost their way.

i fear myself, fear the day i realize it's too late and i can't move my legs to get out of bed anymore. realize that my time is up. but i can say all this shit and where does it take me? a dodgy grammar trip to mud without focus. i'm scared. i'm tired. and I've had enough.



you ever look at somebody and think it must be so easy to be you? yeah well it isn't like that for me. for me i see people and think, are they staring at me? why are you whispering about me. are you annoyed? are you happy with life? i see a guy with a girl and their youth of love. 

i wasted my spare time and honestly don't know how to be self sufficient. i'm afraid of my folks dying, cause then i'll be alone. alone to admit i did nothing, and these people gave me love, gave me a home, but it didn't stop my imagination. that isolated feeling of numb. to not want to face my demons. 

i'm just confused without action. salt without a wound except a breakdown of unknown endings. where will i be..i just want to find peace. "
1215,"  i wonder if they would accomplish if anything at all. or make a fool to destruction because it's alien. it's not THEIR personal self. especially how they would react to criticism, adjusting to new ""family/friends/memories"". i suppose the big one for me would be how they would react to depression, to hope, the little things. the frustration, would they change as a person afterwards from the experience?  that kinda thing.  "
