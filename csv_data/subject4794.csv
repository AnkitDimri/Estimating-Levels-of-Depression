87," As we look back into the literature written around this time, It was apparent that Alexander had a huge ego. He even considered himself the Son of Zeus. However, that wasn't the only reason his empire fell. It was mostly because no one was able to handle the immense amount of land that he had claimed as his own after he died. "

It eventually became one of the top songs on my Spotify playlist. "

130," Avicii

I had been listening to his music for a while now, without actually knowing it was him as the DJ. Some of his tracks were just running on my Spotify playlist, without me paying attention to who was producing the music. Shortly before his death I discovered a TON of his music that really seemed to catch my attention. I was honestly surprised to hear about his death. I was overwhelmed when TIM was released. "
131," When someone is under educated about a subject, they will constantly target the other person personally when they argue. They will continuously make personal remarks towards the other person in order to make others feel like they know what they are talking about.

142," I agree, At the end of day, it isn't going to matter how much you ""hoped"" for something to happened. It depends on how much effort you put into the task you are ""hoping to perform"" "
143," I love how much perceptive this quote gives. Not going to lie, everyone at some point or another forget that they aren't on this planet forever. Eventually every human being on this planet will be replaced with another. We overestimate the time we actually have on this planet, we waste it doing things have that either have no value to them or things that we don't enjoy.  The thing is by the end of your life, you don't want to regret your decisions or feel like you have missed out. "

207," You cannot choose one out of diet and exercise. Both are needed to complete your weight loss goals. If you are not eating the right food, or if you are eating too many calories a day a workout is not going to help you much. Suppose if you eat 600 calories above your daily goal, and you burn 500 of that off; there is still an 100 that is going to work against you. You need both diet and exercise in the equation to see results. 


Also do not forget about strength training. Cardio will lower your weight, it definitely will. But in order to lower your Body Fat Percentage and become leaner, strength training is the way to go. "

348, One of the songs that are going to be stuck in my head for a long time! Great job guys! Well done. Great summer banger! 
349, Made me smile :) 
350, Amazing! 
351, Omgggg!!! 
352," Indian, so many options. "
353, My childhood in one snoo 
354, ^^ me today 
355, We can wander thru the forest 
356, Come along with me 
357, Rewatching the whole series right now! 
358," B1, B2,P1, P4, B3 "
359, Please get those wickets....we need them 
360, I feel like England is going to pull thru....we need those wickets 
361, This luck is amazing 
362, [removed] 
363, How do I flair myself on here? 
364, [removed] 
365, Hoping that the final is not one-sided. Both teams should try to play a strong match! Congrats to all the semi-finalist teams for making it so far and to NZ and England to making to the finals! We are going to have a new winner for the first time since 1992! Personally rooting for the Kiwis! 
366, What are your plans for the time until the finals? I personally am traveling out of country. 
367, Great job to team England! Great to see you guys in the finals against the Kiwis! 
368, That doesn't sound right Mate. A lot of the population of the subreddit is a supporter of team India. 
369," I'm gonna catch up on some zzzs, lemme know how the press conference goes and what happens with the whole Roy thing. "
370, Good job to all semi-finalists! See you at Lords in 3 days! Everyone deserves a cricket break after the twists and turns or cricket for the past 3 days! 
371, Good luck to the Aussies for the Ashes in a month! Get em back. 
372, Congrats to England! 
373, Who are you rooting for:England or New Zealand? 
374, The cheering sounds good after the crowd being basically silent for the past few overs. 
375, Feeling bad for Australia....but they got the Ashes to come! 
376," England has never won the WC, neither has NZ. So there will be a new winner no matter what. "
377, Definitely. 
378," Not all Dhoni's fault. He was batting under loads of pressure. The Indian cricket team does not do well under pressure. He was supposed to be 4th, but the batting line up got changed. It was the dude's last WC match , let's not be this hard om him. "
379," Nah, we are still here. "
380, Exactly!! 
381," After watching yesterday's match with the horns, drums, etc. This seems completely different, the crowd ie so silent. "
382, That reaction from Roy seemed very familiar...I wonder who 
383," Yeah, still kinda sad about that. NZ had some excellent bowling and they deserved it. "
384, I wish India played like this yesterday... 
385," Good job to Jadeja and Dhoni! Both gave us some hope today :) As for the match, still exteremly heartbreaking and very hard to believe. Losses happen, today was not our day. We will come back better than ever in 2023 "
386, Kudos to NZ! Go get the cup! Excellent on the pitch today. Supporting you guys now 
387," No hate on Dhoni He was one of the players that helped India place as one of the best teams statistically. He was and still is a very iconic player and an amazing Wicket Keeper. He did his best in this match too, and he is not the one to blame. Nobody is. Dhoni will forever remain a legend to all of the future generations. "
388, Rooting for NZ all the way now! Go get the trophy! 
389," I feel exactly the same. NZ had a very solid time. Our team has done amazing throughout the tournament, Kudos to the team. "
390, Love to team India 
391," It's extermely sad to see the hate on Dhoni.  He is getting older, and yes he is not as good as he once was he was and still a iconic player of the team. "
392," There is no reason to hate on anyone of the players, the team experienced a loss all together. It was not only one players fault, we can't be too hard on them. There is always a winner and there is always the one who doesn't win. Sometimes it happens. "
393, No need to hate on anyone! Today was MSD's last WC game. Very proud of him for his amazing career! 
394, He probably realized that as soon as he was run out. 
395, Locking this thread would be the best for now 
396, How does that have to do anything with cricket? 
397, So what are y'alls plans for the rest of the day? 
398, What's up with these comments. Uncalled for! 
399," Don't worry, we are gonna stick around for the finals :) "
400," Losses happen sometimes, next time i'm sure they'll be back for the better. If you never lose, you will not appreciate the wins. Kudos to team India for a great tournament! Goodluck against Windies! "
401," Well, obviously, he is getting older. He is about to retire. "
402," Yes, it was very sad to see that 3, not one, 3 of our top batsmen got out on 1 run. "
403, This thread is very wholesome btw! It made it very fun to watch the match! Thank you all. 
404," Our exceptations were too high for India after the Aus VS. Ind. We thought that it would be easy to beat NZ after them being fourth, boy we were wrong. Our openers did not do well, but kudos to Pant, Jadeja and Dhoni for getting us above 200 runs atleast. See you in four years! "
405, Kudos to Dhoni and Jadeja for giving some hope. 
406, Goodjob to New Zealand! 
407, Game over. 
408, Fuck 
409, Shit 
410, Done we are done 
411, Who are the next bowlers? 
412, Current run rate and RRR? 
413, Boundaries!!!! Please! 
414, Good. Same here. 
415, RRR: 9.02 
416," Still a huge margin, they have to take more than singles to reach the RRR. Keep expectations low. "
417, People may have left 
418," Okay, so..India is the number 1 team on the board. Semi final match, dunno what happened today but our top 3 batsman were gone in the first 3 overs.  It rained on the pitch yesterday, so yes. New Zealand has a very strong team too, with their bowlers "
419, What is the RRR? 
420, This is honestly very disappointing 
421," This has been happening for so long, for years now. "
422, No. 
423," Run rate keeps falling, it's about time that they hit some runs. This match is getting out of hand. "
424, This match is honestly getting more pathetic by the minute. 
425, 7.03 run rate needed 
426," The key to this match is honestly keeping your expecatations low. None of us expected what happened in the first 3.1 overs, so none of us know what is going to happen "
427, This commentary is honestly.. 
428, And what was the point of picking up that bat? 
429, Kya hai yeh 
430, Shit 
431, So anyone on Willow....what do you think about the statefarm ad? 
432, Apparently Sachin and Harbajan are very optimistic right now 
433, Wish I had the Hindi commentary.. 
434, English ones are pretty boring...rather listen to the Hindi commentators 
435, Couldn't agree more 
436," My friends at the stadium, what's going on today? Weather? "
437, Are you and I watching the same match? 
438, So what are our forecast for rain? 
439, To what team though? 
440, What is the crowd saying? 
441, Barely any chance of rain. 
442, What finals? 
443, Key to this match: no expectatioms 
444, Game out of our hanss 
445," Mr Prem Jyothish, India neede you help. Let us call you today. "
446," See y'all in 2023, going back to sleep "
447, Fuck

449, What kind of record is he willing to do today. 
450, How the frick is this not a big total. 
451, Every fricking ball is so damn stressful 
452," Kohli, Sharma, Rahul... "
453, First boundary! 
454," See this is what happens, every other time we are very pessimestic. Now when we finally think we have it in our hands...this occurs "
455, Keep expectations low...expectations disappoint. 
456, And now why did we underestimate NZ....? 
457," Kohli out, Rohit out, Rahul out...in the first 3 overs "
458, These wickets are painful...wtf 
459, Well seems like it now.... 
460," Rain, we need you now "
461, The day I actually wake up at 5:30...why did we think this was going to be easy 
462, Seems like the practice match... 
463, All hope lost within 3 overs... 
464, What is this shit 
465, See you all in 2023 
466, Bye goodbye we lost 
467, Changed lineup 
468, High expectations disappoint... 
469, This is a very sad match... 
470, All hopes gone. 
471, Shit 
472, And this is why we had no expectations... 
473, This is going so wrong 
474, Fuck 
475, For some reason Willow is always a ball behind... 
476, Imagine the pressure on the players right now... 
477, This is so stressful 
478, Oh shoot 
479, 10 Minutes Break 
480, Goodmorning from America 
481," Yes, 3 PM. IST "

483, Goodnight from here on the East Coast! See y'all in the morning at 5:30 AM :) 
484, Good Afternoon :) 
485," Hoping for no more delay. This match is very stressful, for us in the thread and for the players. "
486, Good morning to India! 
487," There is a chance of slight rain, but I think we'll be fine "
488, Good morning to everyone in New Zealand! 
489, Yes. 
490, So what are you all doing for the rest of the day? 
491, The winner plays the winner of the 2nd semi-final on Thursday. 
492, Cricket world cup semi-finals. The team which wins heads over to the finals. Another reason for this huge comment number is because of the rain in Manchester (where the match is taking place) and our speculation of whether it was going to happen today or tomorrow. 
493, For us on the East Coast it starts at 5:30 AM. 
494, Goodluck to both teams! 
495, 10:30 GMT 
496, 10:30 GMT 
497, India automatically into finals. 
498, Play starts tomorrow again at 10:30 local time. New Zealand will finish their overs and then India will play their 50 overs. 
499, Officially off. 
500, Cut off is at 6:36 local time. 
501, Why is this still being considered? 
502, When? 
503, New Zealand will finish their few overs. Then India will play their 50. 
504," Woah, very uncalled for. "
505, Good 
506, That's all they are doing on sling. 
507," Hello! Welcome to this very stressed out post. Currently, we are waiting for the umpires to inspect the field and determine if the pitch is playable today not. "
508, There is honestly no point in playing today. Audience must be tired of sitting and waiting around. 
509, What do the inspections say? 
510, Ikr! So annoying. 
511, Inspection is going on. 
512, What is going on? 
513, India automatically in finals. 
514, Covers are coming off again. 
515," Updates from stadium, anyone? "
516, Are covers being taken off again? 
517, India automatically in finals 
518," DLS is a method that determines what happens after it rains. The overs of the match are currently being cut off (one over, every four minutes) India will have to now hit 148 runs in twenty overs if the game play resumes today. Which is very unfair for the team, and the chance of winning is very bleak "
519, Yes! 
520, It would only be fair to both teams. 
521," I know right, it would be heartbreaking. The team has been doing excellent this year. "
522, We are still chasing. 
523," No, most likely it is resuming today. If it were to be done tomorrow, the match will not restart just resume. "
524," Chasing is going to make it harder whatsoever, the match will be rushd. "
525," There is a bleak chance with the rain, we are chasing today. The match will have to be rushed. "
526," Willow is still showing the old games, they aren't even showing the stadium now. "
527, 20 overs 146 
528, I know right! So annoyinf 
529," We shall see, game will have to be rushed. Honestly, it would have been better if it was just done tomorrow. "
530," Rain, please come back. "
531," Let us see, hopefully for India's case it does "
532," Now since covers are coming off, what are the chances for India? What batsmans? "
533, Shoot 
534, Shoot 
535, So is the cover coming off or not? some sources say that game play is being continued tomorrow some say today? Any updates from stadium? 
536, Oh shoot 
537, Good 
538, Hopefully it is unlikely 
539, Oh shit 
540," If today and tomorrow are washed out, India automatically goes into the finals. "
541, What is the chance that the match is played tomorrow instead of today? 
542," If the match resumes tomorrow instead of today, yes. "
543," Yes, one over every 4 minutes. "
544," If the rain washes off the match tomorrow, India automatically gets into the finals. "
545," The match will not restart according to the ICC, they will resume it from where it is right now. "
546, Has number 4 ever occured? 
547, Current score. 
548," That's what the plan is. If the match does not resume today, it will tomorrow. If the pitch is unplayable tomorrow, India will automatically be in the finals. "
549," Good to know, thanks for the update. "
550," Depends on toss, we shall see. "

589, Some motivation. 
590," There are two sides to it, some people seem to love bollywood, they will go watch every movie that comes out and listen to every new song. Some people on the other hand, seem to think many of the movies are very predictable and they will know what happen. They are tired of seeing the same people in the same types of movies. The number of people who think this way is increasing. But Bollywood has realized that is this happening and different types of movies are being released, while some remain the same. T-series on the other hand is a music company, Bollywood music has almost the same story, some people seem to love it and some dislike it and think that it is the same thing over and over again. But in conclusion, bollywood is definetely liked by some extent of its audience. "
591," Many do, some don't. Bollywood is a big  part of the indian culture, and most of the music is produced by T-series.  "
592," Hello, I have been playing the flute for a couple of years now. I currently have this dent near the mouth piece of my flute. I have been trying to tune, all my other notes are in somewhat tune, except the e flat. It goes very very flat. Am I doing something wrong? Thank you in advance. "

626," Many of us have been noticing that Samsung galaxy has not been working very well with pokemon go. Today, for many the lag and glitching got worse. Today I was not able to get onto the game and was having a lot of authentication issues. I know for sure it wasn't because of the wifi or the network because I was smoothly able to get onto the game with an apple device. Sometimes the loading bar just stops half way, In order for the game to open you have to login/restart the game many times which becomes very annoying.

663," So basically I have been trying to lose weight it had been going good for a while until the weight loss hit a plateu and eventually gained. I tried to figure out what the problem is, this was it. Also at the moment I am a teenager so I have to convince my parents to buy me one.  "
664," 1) Today I learnt that my fitbit does not provide very accurate calorie burnt information and usually the calories are less by 27%. This really demotiviated me. How should I track the calories that I burnt accurately without relying on my fitbit charge HR? 

2) I do not have a food scale. I have been trying to have small portions of my food but do not always succeed. Is there anyway other than a food scale I can estimate the amount I food I eat? Are there any other alternatives to a food scale? How do you guys estimate your food portions? 

These are the main questions I have about tracking my calories. I still have a really long way to go, so I want to make sure I'm doing it right and I succeed


Thank you in advance for answering my questions. "
665," Backstory: One day I decided to stop eating as many carbs and calories as I used to and wanted to eat healthy since I was and still am overweight. For a couple of months it felt good I lost a few pounds. After about 7-8 months, the weight stopped dropping. I couldn't stay on the diet anymore, I was frequently having the temptation to eat carbs. I was getting bored of going to the gym everyday and constently doing the same thing. One day I decided to log my food into MFP, I realized that I am slowly going back to what I used to be. Because of this loss of motiviation I gained a little bit of weight and I feel horrible. I need help as to how I resume my weight loss and get back on track and be motiviated or have some self disicipline.  "

667," The advertisement was pretty short. It basically showed a bunch of players around each other doing an Ex-raid then it showed a bunch of players trading. At the end it basically said Trading is here in Pokemon Go or something like that. Sorry, I do not have the full summary and link for the advertisement.

EDIT: It was the trading advertisement they posted on the Pokemon GO youtube channel "
668, Adorable! 
669, So cute! 
670, This is amazing!  
671," To some extent I somewhat agree with your opinion. I agree about how the show has a lacking general story. The creator of the show, Julia Pott, was also part of adventure time. In the season two of adventure time the story line was stronger and was more developed. Maybe, when this show gets a season 2 the storyline connects to the pilot somehow.  "
672," I agree with you, hopefully we get another season and the story develops. "
673," Just from the pilot, who was your favorite character (I know there was not a lot of detail on any of them) "
674," I totally agree with you, I would have been sympathizing with oscar too, and I am also curious about how it would have happened.  "
675, Did you watch the pilot before or after the series? 
676," I didn't get the chance to view all of the episodes on the 48 hour weekend premire. Today, I got a chance to watch all 20 episodes and in my opinion, the first season was amazing! It gave a bit of an adventure time vibe. My favorite character was definetely pajamas. Oscar was also one of my favorites. Hedgehog was meh, I really didn't know the reason as to why I didn't like her much. After I watched the 20 episodes, I realized that there was also a pilot episode which I did not know existed. I watched the pilot episode and I can say that the series is way better than the pilot. I did not like Hedgehog's attitude in the pilot and i'm happy that they changed her attitude. The love triangle aspect in the pilot made me feel really bad for Oscar. Even though I hated the fact about the love triangle, I kinda wanted to see what would happen if there was a love triangle. In conclusion, I really enjoyed season 1 of this series and I hope that they continue to make more episodes. What is your opinion about the pilot? "
677, Thanks for organizing the info! The 1.3% was supposed to be very casual. 
678,"  About 18 hours ago, I posted a survey regarding the community's opinion on gifts and how gifts affect the player's game play. 1700+ people answered this survey. About 76% of the people who answered this survey were between the levels of 35-40. 46.3% of people play in semi-urban areas, 33.5% of people play in urban areas. 15.2% of people play in semi-rural areas and 5.2% of people play in rural areas. Out of the people who answered this survey, 67.8% percent of the people are dedicated players. 22% of the players are casual players. 8.9% of the players are hardcore players, and lastly, 1.3 percent of the players are very casual*. In average, the people who answered the survey had around 40 friends each (average). There is a close tie between players being caught up on opening their gifts. 39.7% of players are caught up opening their gifts. 39.5% of people are not caught up on opening their gifts. 20.7% of players are somewhat caught up on opening their gifts. The people who answered ""No"" in the previous questions, 58% of them are not caught up on their gifts is because of the daily gift opening limit. 21% of the people who answered ""No"" on that question was because of baggage space and storage limit. The rest of the 21% said ""Both or other"". Some of the other answers included, No available egg slot, hatching alolan eggs with pokemon that hatch too much, lack of gifts to return to friends, tedious and takes too much time, many bugs involving the gift system and lags, etc. The average amount of gifts that a player receives a day according to the data from pokestops are about \~12. On average the players who responded to this survey receive 15-18 gifts from their friends daily. 42.8% of the respondents say that they are fine with the daily gift opening limit. 38% of the respondents say that they would like the daily gift opening limit should be removed. 11.6% of the respondents say that Niantic should not get rid of the daily gift opening limit. The rest of the 7.6% of respondents said other options which included, the limit should not be removed but to increase the limit. Some say they shouldn't change the limit and add a gift deleting feature. The community also has a strong opinion on the gift dropping limit from pokestops. Many of the respondents say that they spin about 10 pokestops and get one gift, which in their opinion is ridiculous. 

 EDIT: *It said hardcore again but it was supposed to say very casual "
679," I made the question better to understand and added an ""other"" option for the last question "
680, Opening. 
681,  
682, I play pokemon go too! It became really fun when I learnt about my local community and how dedicated they are.

684," Nevermind my previous answer, specific apps are causing the notifications. I will uninstall those apps. "
685, Yes 
686," -Whenever a notification of any type pops up on my S7, usually it turns off by its self. For the past few days, it has not been turning off. Is there a setting that makes this happen? "
687," I was in school at the moment, when I checked my phone after school I opened twitter, I read a tweet by Alan Walker and realized that he was tweeting about avicii, I did not read it properly so I did not see the rest in peace part. I was confused, so I read it again and I realized what had happened, it gave me instant shock. I looked at the trending on twitter, he was the first one on there. I was shocked, It took me a long time to take in what had happened. I had to go to a school event after that, I told people about what happened and how sad I was, but people didn't know who he was. "
688,  
689," You guys are amazing, you deserve it :) "
690, Oh ok 
691, So no ticket is required to enter the park? 
692," As a first time ticket buyer, I would like to know about the following two questions: 

What information does it ask for while purchasing a ticket?

Will you need to buy a ticket for the people who want to go inside the park, but do not play the game, or would you only need tickets for people who are playing the game?


 "
693, Thanks

702,

704, I just watched it and It has a totally different meaning now. 
705," I did not expect this to happen at all, I was in complete shock. For the next few hours I kept looking for the cause of his death. I keep refreshing this subreddit every so often to look for some news about the cause. "
706," My story: I was in a class and I did not bring my phone, after two hours of his death I picked up my phone and looked at twitter, immediately and I saw Alan Walker's tweet about Avicii, I didn't read it properly and did not read the part where he said Rest in peace, I was wondering why such a long tweet about avicii, then I read it again and I was shocked and I couldn't believe it, I immediately looked at  trending and I couldn't believe it for a whole day, it finally hit be yesterday. "

815," I know, but only 3 additional spawns, and the weather was not marked as exterme "
816," Pokemon Go is detecting the accurate weather for me in my area, but not the correct spawns.It has been snowing for ~5 hours, the game can detect that it is snowing outside, but the spawns that are suppossed to be spawning (Ice and Steel) are as just as rare as they were when it was not snowing.In past 5 hours I have been to 3 parks with a lot of spawn points, most of them were spawning the usual (Pidgey,rattata,sentret,magikarp). I had only caught 3 Ice types and 1 steel type before I went home.Is anyone else also a victim of this? "
817, Okay thank you

1026, Very odd 
1027, A week 
1028, Screenshot 
1029, Maybe 
1030," 1) I had gyarados in my 2nd week
2) I still do not have a machop
3) I had a Poliwrath before a ButterFree
4) I also had a golduck and a slowbro before a butterfree "
1031," Good thing he is alive, I missed his videos and hopefully all is well "
1032, News 
1033, Such a sad thought 
1034," I was wondering the same thing he said he would be gone Thrusday-Tuesday for memorial day weekend but he didn't come back, I think he just wants a bigger break, I think he should tell us on twitter "
1035, Fighting 
1036, Amazing!!! 
1037, Yup I live in Downtown and I incubated all the eggs 
1038, They can still be hatched just hatched yesterday's eggs all of pokemon were abby 2 pichu 3 togepi 3 magby 1 elekid 
1039," This mentioned in one of videos and on twitter that he is gone from thrusday to Tuesday I was expecting a video yesterday but no, I really like his videos "
1040, Rhyhorn 
1041, Machop 
1042, No my town was a semi rural town with not a lot of spots in myarea 
1043, You can take all of mine I have 15 lol 
1044, I realized that to so I'm not downloading them 
1045, Question 
1046, A charizard spawned at the rink a few weeks  
1047, We got 4 extra stops in one area 
1048, I'm from michigan too south east 
1049, I'm mystic too I'm in canton 
1050," On time for once, but I think they should extend it because lots of people on PTC including me missed the larvitar hour and almost a day of the event "
1051, I play on cellular data 
1052, I have never seen a fighting type nest either :( 
1053, Yes I agree it is very frustrating it made me miss a day of rock event 
1054," Same it annoys me a lot too, It made me miss out on a day of the rock event
 "
1055," No, none of the current pokemon using anything evolve in gen 3 and none of the evolution items except Sun Stone are used in future gens "
1056, Thank your for all you and your team do to make this game better:) 
1057, Will try thx for the tip 
1058, Most people walked for chansey but not to many blisseys which is good because there are no fighting types in my part of michigan 
1059, I liked all of them except valentines I only got Slowpokes no chansey or porygon 
1060," The Speed Cap Is 10.5/Hour Which Is slow, And also the sightings list goes away more and that doesn't count distance even if ur walking 5km/hour "
1061, So many people have this glitch they have to fix the glitches before doing a gym rework or something 
1062, So the sightings goes completely blank no spawns  
1063, I missed out so much on the rock event  
1064," Yes, it started way before the grass event but it is happening more "
1065, I got magikarp during the water event but I didn't a single porygon or chansey during the valentine's event 
1066, My friend is also using a IPhone 6 snd she is also experiencing this bug 
1067, It's fine its just so annoying missing out on the rock event 
1068," No, it cannot be because all my friends are experiencing this glitch/Bug none of us ever used trackers/bots and we never used a app iv calculator and we never spoofed "
1069," Sadly I dont get it either, do u have any other questions "
1070, Thx for the tip 
1071, Did u find any other info on levels because I searched a lot and I didn't find anything 
1072, The distance calculations are never correct I walkers 3km just got 0.5km 
1073, Thx for the tip will try doing that 
1074, I have waited 10 minutes and it's sightings are still not back 
1075, So I was outside and I have opened the game for 10 minutes straight and the sightings is still blank 
1076, So annoying 
1077, No literally I'm not at all exaggerating I walked so so so slow and It would not come back 
1078, Same 
1079, Yes because of these glitches I missed out on lot of the rock event 
1080, Exactly it's so annoying 
1081, Where I walk there are so many spawn points I just missed a snorlax my friend caught it and my sighthings went blank and then it despawed 
1082, /u/NianticGeorge /u/Nianticindigo 
1083, I'm really frustrated about glitch I just walked 3 km and it only registers 0.5km 
1084," I know this has been a know glitch for sometime but today it is happening the most, I am out and walking really really slow and it literally goes blank I wait 5 minutes it still doesn't come back the only way to fix for me is to refresh the game, I'm on a S5 , is anybody else experiencing this glitch and are their anyways to fix it "
1085, Fighting I'm level 32 and I don't get any Machops In michigan really 0 Machops or its evolution actually I have 0 fighting types so fighting 
1086," Ditto Glitch has been going on for about a week now, it's just a visual glitch many different ditto glitches dittos just pop up "
