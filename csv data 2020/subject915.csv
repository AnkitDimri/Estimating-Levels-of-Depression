11," Correct, but I also do some video production and part modeling for cnc machines, as well as just general computer building and tech support. "
12," Intel, AMD, Nvidia "
13," Not anything too crazy. Ive machined parts for missiles for the US military as well as parts for military bombs, planes, etc.

I dont make any parts for the government or military anymore though because I cant live with myself knowing that my work is used for killing people, no matter who that person is. Ive transitioned almost completely to parts for hospitals and medical equipment used for helping people. It pays a bit worse but makes me proud of my work. "
14, Machinist 
15, Same here Im feeling the exact same way. 
16," Im not even gay but every day I nut 17 times to my own bitmoji. I couldnt imagine a day without my bitmoji and I take him everywhere I go. I made my bitmoji look like Alex Jones and I dont even find Alex Jones sexy, but I cant resist his curves in Bitmoji form. Every night I think about my bitmoji and wish I could just be with him in real life. I wake up every day with 7 nuts in my boxers, knowing that those nuts could of been shot between my bitmojis ass cheeks. I dont know how to continue like this.  "

25, If you have AirPods its because you cant afford the wire. 
26, Play the demo 
27, Couldnt have said it better myself. 
28," Make your name the biggest on the map
 "
29,  
30, 2600 much better at gaming 1700 much better at video editing but they are both still good for both tasks. 
31, The internet collectively rejoices 
32, I saw a series of tutorials that were 20 parts and 30 minutes each and from then on refused to watch tutorials and just learn the game myself. 
33, Its not just you. 
34," Thats normal, the game always lags. "
35," There is no cd version, like pretty much all games "
36, I have an i5 6500 and Im waiting for zen 2

46, ***lmao***

48, Yes 
49, [removed]

Also in terms of finding games, try using cs rin ru. "
51," Igggames.


***just kidding please dont go there*** "
52, 2600 
53," Yes, one of my computers has a ryzen 5 2600 and an rx 580 and it gets 60 FPS on 1080p at max settings on almost all games. If you want 1080p 144 FPS go with a Vega 56 or 64 on amds side or a gtx 1070 or 1080 on novideos side.

Edit: esports games such as csgo May be able to reach 144 FPS though as they are built to run fast. "
54, Not at maximum settings  
55," I understand a key gen is not as risky, but my general philosophy is to never do anything like that for a security software. "
56," Generally, using a key gen on a security software is a bad idea as it is supposed to be secure, but it can work, though I would never do it. "
57, The game lags so much late game that I like to leave it running and maybe make something to eat or play another game with hoi running in the background. 
58, Its a very divided topic but I would say buy it on sale. 
59, I have 700 hours in the game and Im pretty good but I have never looked up any guides or metas and just learned through my own experiences and interpretation. 
60," I played the game 10 hours not knowing how to unpause, now I have 700 hours in the game. "
61, No 
62, Fixed it 
63," Dont know because I didnt use them so this comment is useless. Its only here to take up a few bytes on the reddit servers and slow them down an imperceptible amount. And not only that, this comment also serves to waste the precious seconds of those unfortunate enough to be subject to reading this. "
64, Probably too overpowered  
65," Noctua is probably the best air cooler brand, but kind of pricey. They do have an NH-U14S that I would recommend if you can find it for $60. "
66," Obviously people here would say yes so look at some opinions outside of this place, but also yes, it is very much worth it. "
67, 580 hours and Im close to my first launch. 
68," Obligatory verify game files, reinstall even if u said u did and did u try turning it off and on again? "
69, Pakistan existed but Burma did not 
70, R5: Ive played India a few times before the update but this has never happened until after the update. I'm pretty confident that this had to have been added in the update because it uses the new tags and states in India and i was not using any mods. I went down the fascist path and already had one civil war that I won only to have this happen. 
71,  
72, On sale yes but also do some research and check what dlcs look the most interesting to you. 
73, Nope 
74, Switch the U.K. and New Zealand  
75, Probably 2020 or 2021 
76, I play Uruguay the most often because its so difficult that even after 700 hours I still cant do well sometimes. 
77, Wait for zen 3 just to check what it is the rumors are promising. 
78, Its in the base game 
79, I get 0 kbps down and 0.02 kbps up 
80, I got a rx 580 8gb for $170 and it performs better than the 1060 6gb in my other computer. 
81, Buy on sale 
82, Indeed 
83, If you have absolutely no hours in the game maybe try Tibet and annex Bhutan and Nepal. If you have somewhat of an idea what you are doing try playing Iran or the USA. You could also play Mexico and annex all the Central America countries. 
84, Probably not I have 700 hours in the game and I dont even know how to survive as Lithuania
