0, Thats news to me. 
1," You really didnt and you kept saying only forced anal intrusion was rape which is clearly wrong and weird. As if vaginal rape isnt rape? But I digress I have homework to do and people to see. So uh bye Bye, and next time maybe educate yourself. "
2, Thats a sociopath. I dont know what to tell you. Nor do I care in all honesty. 
3, Oh not really. Thats all fake. I care about my karma. People just usually respond better when they think Im sweet and docile. Guess I over did it this time. 
4, Hmm oh I gave up. I remembered the effect ( cant quite remember what its called) where people who are presented with new facts opposing what they thought was true they dont usually actually change their minds. They just double down on whatever their believe. Its actually why religions like jahovas witnesses send their children door to door. It isnt to spread the faith. They know the kids will be rejected. 
5, Huh ok. I didnt realize any of that was bad Im really sorry Ill delete it. 
6," Oh well thats weird. He said yes, and to put them everywhere. It was a bunch of sources "
7, Pretty much. 
8, Dude its in the rules. Men arent even allowed in that sub. Thats sexist if Ive ever seen it. 
9, r/emojipolice calm down sir just a ticket. Five Hail Marys and youll be good to go. 
10, Atm bad. Still bad. But more my normal bad and not toss my self out a window and land head first bad. Kinda wanna stab someone but thatll go away. 
11, Did you read the post? Well I guess you mustve despite the question. Well my dear stranger Im bad. Im a little better than I was earlier but Im still bad. Empty and hateful. Almost a whole human (minus the emotions). 
12, HI 
13, I mean.... she is a little rich white girl. That is a pure statement of fact. 
14, Better is a relative term. Better than 5 is 6 but better than 0 is 1 so I guess you could say that I am doing better in the way that I will in fact not jump out a window. 
15, My fingers are slipping and Im gonna fall man Im just choosing to fall faster. 
16, Oh well hey. So you snooped on my post history that nice. Thanks for the info on melatonin. maybe if I take enough I could just sleep through next week? And as for it wont help nothing does. As for school well school is a living nightmare and probably where Ill be sent in hell. As for dogs with jobs that joy is fleeting and temporary as well as doing nothing to ease my cold dead heart. Im just done I have no energy left 
17, Well hi. Stranger 
18, No prob go live your best life 
19," 1. No
2. Occasionally but its harder for me than others
2. No "
20,  
21, Id be fucking partying like yes FUCKING FINALLY. 
22, Nah Im just..... Im just tired. Im just done. Life has thrown everything it can at me and it won. The scars on my mind will never heal and Im just done . 
23, The cake is a lie 
24, We dont want to hear the whole story because that usual ends in being the man is right. There fixed it. 
25, I dont even know man.... te keep from opening and subsequently jumping out the window maybe. Oh wait never mind. Someone years ago must have beat me to it because I just saw that the windows at my school are sealed. So goodbye. 
26, To all of you I bid a hearty goodbye. I cant stand it anymore. Im so tired tonight Im just going to go to sleep. Can melatonin pills be fatal? I sure hope so. Thanks for years of strength. Wish me well off this mortal coil. 
27, No prob bob. Go have some fun Im gonna go uh honestly idk. 
28, Just keep trying. Were all waiting for you on the other side. 
29, No prob but were still gonna talk. I need to keep my hands busy anyway. 
30, I doubt youll use what I did because it isnt the healthiest but why not Ill do it anyway. Well you see I stopped giving two fucks. I shut down so hard I barely feel anymore. 
31," Nah Broski. I used to feel like just as much of a burden as you do, but then I realized. Why do I give a shit if I slow down their day a bit. Drop the knife close the window step off the ledge. Just take a moment. Breathe. Close your eyes and image where you would like to be at all times. "
32, Sure why not. 
33, Music helps me calm down. Lately the effectiveness is slipping though and I can feel my madness creeping in on the shattered prices of my mind. 
34, Im in class trying not to jump out the second story window behind me. 
35, Hey. Were gonna talk. 
36, Yeah..... maybe the public should stop giving that any attention. 
37," Yeah so this is just the first time, 2 women do this thing. Which is not important. "
38, Nah just sacrifice me already. Just come the fuck on super villain come here bitch. 
39, Didnt an all female space walk happen already? It was only one but still. Why is this special? 
40," No Im not giving up. I had to go to sleep because I have actual people things to do, like school. You should go to one, it might really help you. "
41," Yeah see, case and point. This is why Im just gonna go have an intelligent conversation because this, this just isnt it. "
42," For the  women cant really rape men comment. What about the shit ton of marital rape where men just wake up with a chick riding them. Did they consent? No. Marital rape towards men actually happened more to men by the way. What about the celebrities who have come out saying they have drugged and raped men, and nothing happened about it. What about the men who are mentally and physically abused in a relationship into sex. ( relationship abuse actually happens more towards men as well). How about all that. How about women can really rape men. "
43," Wow ok. You know what, Im just gonna. Im just gonna go. "
44, Nuh bad.*sprits sprits* bullets 
45,  
46, Just swat em all the same 
47, Triple e? 
48, Nope Im a yee haw Boi. Still more humid than hell down here and weve got a fuck ton of the lil shits rn. 
49, I won. 
50,  
51, Spaghetti monsters 
52, Hes suck a great guy and actor. He should be put in a place almost with Keanu. Dont get me wrong not quite Keanu but almost. 
53, Dude come on. Thats the same logic as  dude you didnt get raped you got free sex! And  come on man youre lucky shes so hot! 
54, Dude just.... just no. 
55, Never claimed to make dude 
56, Hey Im sorry about those guys. I upvoted this and did my part. 
57, I did my part I call Thor 
58," That kids gonna do things. Maybe not great things, but things nonetheless. "
59, That third panel got me 
60, No! Con ganas mijo. Kill it kill it! 
61, What if instead of just harassing girls I harass everyone? 
62," I mean, logistically since gay people are the minority. She is not like other girls. "
63, Will do. 
64, I guess your probably right. 
65, I feel like it could still be  easily looked over. I mean when you see lights attached to whats going to look like nothing youre going to look over them. 
66, Why cant the future be human dang dummy dumb dumbs 
67, What about at night. Can they see the car? 
68," Dude rule nmero uno, Dont stick your dick in crazy. "
69, Whoever should be out there shouldnt be based on who has a dick or  not. I want the most qualified and over all best people up there representing us. Wether the have a sausage between their legs or not. 
70," Holy shit fuck dude. Mind if I uh, borrow these. "
71, I wouldnt go with all men. But certainly some. Although I dont feel guilty about doing anything to anyone. That may have more to do with my mental condition than my dick though. 
72, Queen! Queen!queeeeeen! We got her boys! We found the new queen! 
73, I want choccy coffee 
74, Hell yeah i wanna 
75, I have a friend like that and Ive found its best to come back at her with the same intensity if not more. 
76, Ah ok thanks Broski. 
77, What is her username? 
78, For the Cleavage of course 
79," Mr. Stranger, since you seem so wise would you answer me one question. What do you do, when you dont feel sad. When you dont feel mad. When you dont feel happy or scared or anything. When you just feel cold. And tired. And you want it to end and you want to go to sleep and fade away. "
80," I havent found one yet. But lately Im thinking, maybe I should live to prove that I can. Do it for fun. Do it for all the people I have left to steal from and the money I have left to spend on booze and drugs. I will die at 40 in a comical pile of cocaine, and the best part is that my death wont be from the cocaine. I dont yet know where to get all that cocaine from. So I have to live until  I do. "
81, I feel like Im a mix. Because Im just a little ball of hatred for all. 
82, They took the picture made a couple books gave it to them. Took another picture. Put that on a book. And released it. 
83, Im just so drained. Im tired of it all and I want it to end. I want to sleep forever. Lay in my bed think sweet thoughts and drift off into the abyss. Is it so bad to just want it to be over? Is it so bad to just be done? Can I just.... can I just finally rest now? 
84, I dont get asked anything by anyone but my mother.y friends havent asked if I was ok in a while. Im used to it. 
85, Im sorry I was going to have the sex and I used it to add an inch to my size. Then I had a whole two inches. 
86, My ass after Taco Bell 
87," Honestly this looks like a joke. I dont think this is serious I mean, use your cooter to stop a shooter. "
88, Oh I know imma do great shit. I can feel it in my bones. Im either going to be the biggest fucking drug kingpin. Or the next Elon. I have no in between. One way or another I will be remembered. But either way imma die at like 40 in a comical pile of cocaine.

93, Dude. Whos joe 
94, Wow that came way out of left field. Whats up. 
95, No problem I tried to get them to go upvote your stuff. But the mods wouldnt let me put upvote or go show him some love in the title 
96, Aww thanks. 
97, Exactly. It makes it easy to get away with shit. 
98, Ooh a girl. You know... satanic cults usually hold ritualistic orgies. But as the cult priest I have deemed that we can do it with just two. 
99, I cant rn give me a bit 
100, No I know. He used a bunch in that continue conversation 
101, *in British accent* this explains so much 
102, Below average is still not average. you are different! Just a sucky different. 
103," Oh dip, Jason "
104, go bomb him in his dms. He used way more off screen. 
105, I called they will come. 
106,  
107, So I guess that makes me satanist? Yeah that sounds right. Hail satan brother. 
108, r/emojipolice imma need some backup! This guy is a real menace. 
109, Woah woah woah sir calm down.

113,  
114, r/emojipolice just a warning this time sir. Be safer next time. 
115, Even if you change countries to continents its still not right. She forgot left Russia and right Russia 
116, I was so confused then the bricks started spinning like someone gave em cocaine. 
117, Yes him 
118,  
119, I mean... look at what hes wearing. Hes wearing scrubs. Hes a nurse. So its either he gets to work and saves lives. Or whatever they were protesting for. 
120,  
121, Ah do I have to worry about any lies then? 
122, Innit tho. Im sorry for this tho but uh r/emojipolice actually you know what Ill let you off with a warning. 
123, You see the secret to happiness is not having a dick. If you got one chop it off. 
124, What ails you? 
125, No. Im not falling for that 
126, Tablets like pills? 
127, Tell ol dovakin your troubles friend 
128, Hey did you hear about that true story movie that got made? The one where strippers roofie rich guys and steal from them? And nothing happens to them! 
129, Maybe we judged you too quickly. 
130, No more than a regular hot tub would. 
131," Nuh uh. Fool me once shame on me, fool me twice shame on you, fool me three times and I just want some fucking nudes Broski. "
132, Nope I see those comments. I know whats going on here. You put the finger circle as your picture didnt you? You sly dog. 
133, Aww shucks. You know how to make a guy blush. 
134, Hell yeah you can. Your so amazing you deserve waaaay more compliments. 
135, So hour parents were right? Thats about as far from hot you can be without being named Karen. 
136, Just... eh... just stop. That joke was just.... AMAZING I love you have a nice day internet stranger. 
137, I mean.... 
138, I want whoever made you to delete you. 
139," I mean, Im fourteen so sometimes me and my friends will get dropped off at the movies but at four?! Jesus Christ. "
140, Oh yes children included. 
141, Hey u/sad-giraffe why u so sad? 
142,  
143, If its fun do it. By all means that by one knows Im an exemplary kid. No one ever has any trouble with it when I say the kid that has a track record of doing bad shit did it. 
144, u/notJB1 
145, That had us in the first half not gonna lie 
146, Cmon sir this doesnt have to be a big thing here. 
147," Just smile and nod I guess. As for raging, I dont really get mad. Just mildly annoyed. "
148, When red guy slammed his face on the ordering machine. Fucking priceless. 
149, r/emojipolice just a minor ticket right now sir stay safe. 
150, Holy shit. I just saw that. God damn what are the chances. 
151," I mean.... if my sister is anything she to go bye. Ive only ever called my dad anything once in my life and he deserved it ( Im a little brother) . But my sister on the other hand, well. Shes sweet and nice... until she heres those to letters (no) then shes a bitch. Insults and shit everywhere. "
152," Omg Im in chem and I cant write that well.

(Chem is a year above bio) "
153," I think therefore I am.
*Ren descartes intensifies* "
154, My history teacher two years ago did this once in a test. She made all the answers a except for the last one. If somehow you see this mrs. Maldonado I love you your still my fave teacher and Sam was the best time Ive ever  had. 
155," Just did this In chem with one of my homies last week. He most certainly wouldnt have passed that exam without me. Best part, Im a freshman hes a junior. I helped someone in a higher grade than me :) "
156," You see Im pretty sure if you look at her contact on your phone, youll see a button that says block her. Push it, and suddenly she decides to stop texting and calling you. "
157," Ha. Sin hasnt bothered me since.... uh, now that I think about it its never really bothered me. "
158," Well have a good satanistic, fun, and most importantly *you* day. "
159, Oh. Wow. Im not used to people agreeing with me. 
160, Yeah. So the things that people say are the divisa work arent wrong. For the most part they are a form of self expression or being an individual. We agree? 
161," I mean yeah but some of the things that people say is the devils work like gayness, and rock and roll music such and so on. How are those wrong? My point is they arent. So by the things people say is explicitly say is the devils work, is in no way wrong by the actual moral standard we should hold ourselves to. My point on god still stand tho, that son of a .... well nothing, but hes narcissistic from everything Ive heard and read. I guess you could say hes got a *god complex* "
162," Ok so about spanking. For the most part no it is not an effective punishment, but when used as a last resort and not as the only punishment, it can work. Ive only ever had to be spanked once maybe twice. I learned the line and I know not to cross it. I also damn well deserved it. It can be ok as long as its not all the time. "
163, Not like I follow that rule anyway 
164," One thing Ive always thought about the typical depiction of satan is that what he stands for doesnt seem bad when you look at it. It seems fun, it seems freeing, it seems like whatever you want. God on the other hand, or at least the one these people del real about wants you in his image and anything else is wrong. Kinda seems like god is a class a narcissist "
165, Im sorry something might be wrong brain wise O.P but thats kinda normal. Most parents these days parents dont know a whole lot about mental illness. They were told it was nothing so thats all they know. 
166, I mean yeah I guess thats narcissistic but its small potatoes compared to the other shit Ive seen here. 
167, I dont get how thats wrong either? So now we are going after people for having and expressing any religious beliefs? She didnt attack anyone? 
168, I love the insinuation that moms who vaccinate arent real moms. 
169, Oh I get this yeah. Actually one time last year a friend and I (we are best friends) were talking and I said man why are you so stupid and he laughed and shrugged it off. But then this other kid in the group that neither of us really like was like ha ha yeah ed why are you so stupid. And we both just kinda stopped talking and looked at him. 
170, Middle row and four to the right knew what he was doing. 
171, [removed] 
172, I know this sounds like a dumb question but do yall get paid by fire or something? Or is it hourly? And what do you do when there isnt a fire? Do yall just chill and play card games till the alarm? 
173, Im feeling called out right now. 
174, I know those are subreddits but I have no idea what theyre for. 
175, Well thanks man. Idk either but it has negative 13 points which sucks. 
176," I just wanna say cuz I havent seen it (correct me if Im wrong I dont have the audio) but how do we know she isnt just facing the phone behind her while watching the road? Like my aunt does that all the time. Shell get the camera hit record and put it on the kid without taking her eyes off the road. When shes done videotaping, she just stops the camera. "
177," My dad made reas that in first grade when I was sick and had to go with him. Once I finished that one he gave me hitchhikers guide to the galaxy. Once I finished that one, he realized I would go through any book he gave me and just let me watch cartoons. He gave me books as a sort of warning. Like if I was gonna stay home because I said I didnt feel good it wouldnt be chillin and watching tv. It was to make sure I was actually not feeling good. Every time Ive ever taken one of those at test where its not on a book but its to asses how good you are at reading and vocabulary. On the last one I took in 8th grade it told me what percentage of people I did better than. Not to brag but I got better than 99% of people who took that test. I also got the highest score in that class that was so far into the above grade level category that my teacher practically let me breeze through that class. Fun times. "
178, Username checks out 
179, rapunzel rapunzel let down your hair 
180, Probably. You also may not be you and Id just wake up with a different body. Never had my head taken so Im not quite sure of the specifics. 
181," Yeah sure why not. It seems yours doesnt work anyway, so being the kind generous souk I am, Ill give you mine. "
182, I didnt though? I think you may have misread that. Or do you just not know how to read? Well in any case it quite clearly says  off with two f not one. 
183, What are you talking about? I think you may have misread that. 
184, Oppsies ever so sorry your grammar lord. May you deem it fit to cut off my head for this most heinous transgression. 
185, I can relate but at least hes trying to get better.  Once the withdrawals stop it will get better. 
186," I occasionally do that but not on purpose. My add means I zone out really quick. When I zone out I like dont blink,  and it can seem like Im staring at you. Not only have I gotten weird looks and asked to stop. On time I got slapped by some girl who thought I was being pervy. That was fun, I barely even knew her. "
187," I occasionally do that but not on purpose. My add means I zone out really quick. When I zone out I like dont blink,  and it can seem like Im staring at you. Not only have I gotten weird looks and asked to stop. On time I got slapped by some girl who thought I was being pervy. That was fun, I barely even knew her. "
188, Nope. The only thing I do is for my six year old cousin and I dont even let her win. I let her get me to where like one hit will kill me then I beat her up. Then I finish the game. 
189," This is a way of manipulating you into staying in an abusive relationship. When you leave her you will prosper like never before having dropped the dead weight. Once you drop her and prosper, you can buy 10,000,000 phones. "
190," I dont want it off. Since my school allows for costumes on Halloween it means the girls get and take a chance to wear uh... provocative, clothing. "
191, Unless its Julia 
192, Theres this homophobic kid in my class. Me and a couple girls in my class (Im a dude) really enjoy playful teasing you know an arm around the shoulder and when I do I like to whisper in his ear  extra homo. 
193, I upvote and post minimally. Not even sure if I can on r/memes 
194," Every time I get new glasses I feel like my eyes hit a reset button, and I see my height. "
195, My upvote got it trending! 
196," Well thanks for that attack on the very land where I sleep breath eat and learn. Sorry for being proud of the men and women who sacrifice their lives, having family have died in service. And my current step-father having been in the navy. So uh yeah, thanks for that. 

Cmon dude I literally didnt say anything about any other country. I didnt say anything derogatory, plus thats super off topic. Come on man cool your jets. "
197, Did you know the u.s army has recently dropped its standards for female recruits to get more in. These are the people fighting for my god dang nation and I want them to be the god damn best of the best. Standards shouldnt get dropped for anyone to get into anything. 
198, Is no one going to mention that BOTH of the guys are Mario 
199, The thing is are these real? With Elon I genuinely cant tell. 
200," Broski samesies Im in ninth too! Chemistry has so much math, and avagadros number has so many decimal points its crazy: "
201, Apple has a dark mode now! 
202, Bitch? La chancla es de Mexico! 
203," But.... but... but I wanna buen down Paris! Not out of anger or anything, I just think the fire would dance in your eyes making you even more beautiful than your already amazing self! 

See what I did there, I just said I wanted to burn down Paris, but I still got you to walk away thinking I was a nice guy cuz I complimented you. My point is a little compliment goes a long way. Oh and op I didnt lie or exaggerated you look amazing today. "
204, Ive seen that damn meme for years now and I will never not love it. 
205, Just marry each other already. 
206, This man looks like every ps2 character ever. 
207, Wow. Im thoroughly impressed. You took all the time to write that response for little ol me? Wow mister have a nice day. 
208, Hmm? 
209, No no I like Shakespearean speech. I cant do it but I like it. 
210," Woah dude, Shakespearean much? "
211, I guess its different from person to person. 
212," Listen, those assholes should have no say over how you feel. Fuck em, they dont deserve you in all tour elegant grace. Any single one of them would be lucky to even see you. You are above them in every way shape and form. They dont know what theyre talking about. You are amazing, you are the best of them. People mock those they are jealous of, theyre just jealous of how god dang awesome you are. "
213," I guess that makes some sense, but still be careful about it. Ive head that saying my whole life and I know how it can make one feel. Like failing is unacceptable. Maybe it was just me but still. Well anyway that makes sense so go on your way "
214, Oh. Well thanks for the heads up Broski 
215, Why is he a scammer? 
216," Yeah we cant be like them, dont lower yourself to their level. We need to stay above them. And if nothing else, remember it gets the point across better. "
217, Oh shoot Im sorry I must have accidentally skipped that one. Im really sorry. 
218, I mean it could be a fear not of death itself but of the pain that ending it would be. 
219, Unpopular opinion? Do you know what sub youre on? Thats everyones opinion here. 
220," Yeah they yelling is called discipline. Parent shout sometimes just sit him down and talk to him, apologize. I know you may not want to apologize but its about the long game. I cant stand being yelled at because when my mom snapped at me like that she never apologized and it made me feel unwanted and shit. Also make sure he knows he cant be doing that anymore. If he thinks he can just run to his mom when youre mad at him, all your punishments will be null and void, he will get out of control trust me Ive seen it. "
221," One time in class when I had a bunch of shit going on at home I just broke. I snapped and all my shit fell. I was sobbing horribly but quietly. I was told to shit up and  man up instead of people asking what was wrong I was labeled as a bully. My father had just moved away and I was being hit with the fact that I would no longer be able to give him his goodnight hug and kiss every night. I know Exactly who labeled me as the baby, Jessica if your reading this fuck you. "
222," Dude, be sensitive, I get this is bad but try and have a bit of sympathy, not for your humanity or anything like that but its been shown that when advice comes people are more likely to take it when I comes without insults. Its more useful to be kind when speaking because it gets the point across better. "
223," Ok about this saying as its quite common. You have to try before you can do. You stumble before you walk. Saying just do it dont try promotes the notion that failing is bad, when in fact its expected. Yes eventually you will get to the do part but first you have to try, slip ups are ok shit happens its called humanity. Im not trying to attack you or anything just inform. "
224, Did you know that the estrogen ( the female chemical) chemical is scientifically linked to mood swings? Hmm where have I seen that before? 
225, Actually for most of my life I didnt even realize that was a scar. It doesnt look like any of the other scars on my body and I had very little idea of what it was. I didnt know I had been circumcised. I only just realized that was a scar and ever since looking at it puts a sick pit in my stomach. 
226, I love the smell of brownies cooking. So many memories. 
227, I do. I dont have friends or an on call therapist so I do I like to post when Im feeling stressed or nervous. I like to read the comments and respond to them. It takes my mind off other stuff 
228, No I just make bad jokes when Im nervous sorry Ill delete it 
229, No it was meant to be a joke. Sorry I make bad jokes when Im nervous 
230," So I was in the restroom thats connected to my room. And my stepdads room is right next to mine so while I was in there I heard him say your drunk and your taking it out on me to my mom, that kinda scares me because Ive head stories about when she used to drink and I heard she wasnt nice when she was drunk, like rlly not nice. Now Ive seen my moms not nice back when my parents were still together. That scares me. So Im posting here, to calm down. Posting helps me calm down I like reading and responding to comments. "
231, Yo Angelo 
232,  
233, And I spook 
234,  
235," Lol its ok, I had fun talking to you anyway "
236, Oh you were talking about the brand thermos I thought you meant like the cup. And are you sure? That looks like a hydroflask to me. 
237, r/emojipolice put your hands behind your back and come with me sir. 
238," Hydroflask is a brand that sells thermoses its just a widely hated brand, so Im calling out on that hate for internet points ok. Chill let me hate a brand. "
239, And I nope 
240, Watercup 
241, No no I dont. I mean hydroflask 
242, Holy shit can you imagine how scary that must be 
243, And I oop 
244," Wtf dude, I care. Why you gotta be such an ass "
245, Extra homo 
246, Its a #hydroflask 
247," I mean if you have life you shouldnt be getting parole anyway. You gotta do some crazy shit to get life, if you do that kinda shit I dont want you out here. "
248, I dont get the point of anything plus life. Past life they cant serve anything. 
249, Caaaaaaaaarl    It isnt even my birthday! 
250, Yeah something like that. I would never hurt my magic dragon. 
251," Oh, Lydia didnt uh...... last very long "
252,"  No problem, for your compliment I wont shout you off a mountain. "
253, Holy shit I found the missing link! 
254, I rlly like that kinda emojis vibe your giving off. You look cute 
255, Not the hentai shirt!!!!!!! 
256, r/emjipolice hold your hands in the air 
257," Well it has been theorized that it could be created. My thoughts were one arm giving energy to the other arm and the other arm giving it back, and so on and so forth. This could theoretically create a motion machine and end all energy problems. "
258," I like my things and I tend to get pissed when people mess with my shit, but only because messing with my shit usually means getting in my way. I dont like that. "
259, I didnt realize until I saw the brand and I was like whaaaa..... oh 
260, Is her name fresh? 
261, What about a father? 
262, R/EmojiPolice HOLD YOUR HANDS UP. 
263, Oh its not a school paper but the topic comes up more than you would believe during lunch conversation or lectures during class. 
264, Ah fuck it Ill just get me a dude instead of a chick ( Im a dude) 
265," Ok Im that case it isnt domestic violence since he isnt in a relationship with her at that point in her time stream. She is a trained warrior, he is a foreign unknown attacker. So once again watch the movie, take a chill pill. They didnt kill iron man because he was a white male, his contract expired. "
266, Well thanks Broski. Will do 
267," Yeah dude, insults get you banned, words can hurt, this is kindergarten stuff. "
268," About gamora its a movie dude, guys get hit so do girls take a chill pill and enjoy the show. I can remember what he did but Im pretty sure he deserved it. "
269, Dang I was going to use this in class but I live in the u.s.a 
270, Who said its a joke? 
271, I dont understand is he like psyching himself up or does he expect it to come to him or what 
272, Is that... is it... is it HIM though 
273, Mmm do that though? Like how do I know Im not dead and this is just my personal hell? Cuz it kinda feels like it. 
274, Oh yeah. Kinda forgot that story 
275, Did it happen to you too? 
276, Why... why would that be what you wanna do for you life? 
277, Is that.... did you.... did you count all the skely boiz on that train? 
278," Dear neuro-typicals 
If you wish to keep all you money and/or blood, dont trust us, and dont think you can change us. Or do, its entertaining to watch. "
279, Nah he was just preparing to fly in Australia 
280, I do I deceive and lie all the time. The very consent of the masks we wear is a sort of deception dont you think. 
281, Im the same. I wanna fuck wether it be dude or chick I dont give a fuck. 
282," I would explore this more. Find what makes you cry and try to be able to cry on command, it would really sell fake sadness. Ive Been trying but I just cant cry, I have no tears. "
283, I have three people my mother my father and my best friend. Not including my pups of course. 
284," Well I got an so that was Mormon. I got an so for sexual stuff. Needless to say I was not fully pleased when she wouldnt do anything. But after time and playful jokes we did do stuff. So basically what Im trying to say is, you are a tool and I will make you want go be used like one. "
285, Ooh ooh I excel at this. Im very good at faking everything from sincerity to even lying. The trick for sad is the head tilt and the eyes. For happy just seem energetic. If you want more just dm me 
286, Im look for the ultimate enjoyment. I want one super complacent person that I can do whatever with. You know the holy grail. Then once Ive sucked them dry Ill move on to another one 
287," My sister went off to college and my mother cried. I still dont really understand why, shes only six hours away and they didnt Have a great relationship anyway. "
288," I find it interesting, its a source for entertainment, when Im bored and have nothing else to do, go text my girlfriend tell my girlfriend that I want to break up and watch her cry. "
289, All the time. Ive even *accidentally* choked someone out before. I almost did it but I got caught and I said he attacked me. 
290," Ive never been in love I dont think. I thought I was once but I realized my feelings were no where near as strong as hers and she was very emotional, that led me to the conclusion that what I was feeling was not love, and maybe some other form of bond. Whatever it was it was easy to break and it was interesting to watch her cry. "
291, I have absolutely no idea how. I do this in class all the time. I just fucking check out and suddenly Im in a tv show or something. 
292," Yeah I have trouble with that to. But I love noticed that if Im in a group, and I say something, then that all go quiet, I probably offended someone. Not that I care a whole lot "
293, I know and Im sorry its off topic but I just had to 
294, I dont self destruct but I do get destructive. 
295," Hmm what term can we find that has a high negative connotation, where you are bound, blamed, and hurt? Oh Ive got one TORTURE. In torture you are bound so you cant escape or fight back, you are hurt, and you are blamed for it. "
296, Just wanted to say that I upvoted this to NICE 
297," Wait so the womens bathroom was full. So you *a man* got kicked out of the mens room, so a *women* could use it? Am I getting that right? "
298," You must be swift as a coursing river * be a man* you must be strong as a great typhoon, mysterious as the dark side of THE MOON. "
299, I just had to work with ah *shudders* partner in English. 
300, Ah si it knows DE WEH 
301, My dad had a shirt with the front on it but not the back. 
302, I know I just like to clarify.:) 
303, Im not a furry but I like zoology. 
304, Help myself you say? Now that I can do! 
305," Hmm. But what can we do? I as a dude am crippled socially. Even been suspended for fighting against a female bully, Ive seen firsthand the bias in the custody system. But Im just a kid. Im sitting in Spanish class having just taken a test theres nothing I can do. "
306," I mean willful ignorance is still ignorance. And in my opinion the fact that its willful just makes them less intelligent. The fact of the matter is they dont want facts, they dont want logic or reason. They want to be mad, and the patriarchy is an easy target. The fact that men cant fight back against their lies, coupled with their structurally perfect logic. It makes the perfect war machine for creating a social uprising against problems that dont really exist. Case and point, the wage gap. "
307, Bad words! *sprits sprits* no lolis 
308, Sprits sprits! No! No underage girls! 
309, Those arent his hands theyre his paws. 
310, The one with the long hair reminds me of pearl. 
311," Welp Im 14 too so fuck it, Im down. Shes not *wrong* though. "
312, How is that scary? And that really just seems kinda lazy. I mean a stick figure?really? 
313," Ah yes, the lumberjack cafeteria. "
314, How the leaves go down is simply amazing 
315, Duuuuddddeeeee stop that youre gonna get the human race sued! 
316, Dude! Sweet a perpetual motion machine! I love those. Can it actually run forever or will it stop eventually? 
317, Lmao he was calling you stupid while he made so manny grammatical and spelling errors his whole side was almost impossible to read. 
318," Yes yes I am ready to die. Bring it old man.
(This is a joke please dont downvote me into oblivion) "
319," A:tax fraud.
B:rob a billionaire.
C:murder. "
320," Hmm, so what Im hearing is; when I get my license dont speed? "
321, Just a heads up shouldnt this have a progress flair 
322," Sooooo what I got was he was never proven guilty, but from that final one innocent until proven guilty doesnt apply here for..... some unexplainable reason. "
323," No but I have friends that go in both, and second hand experience can still be called experience. All my friends who are female talk to me about the gossip and such that goes on in there, in turn I tell her the wacky shit that goes on in the mens room. "
324, Yes but Im going to guess that one says female. Im also going to guess this was a very poorly received and very poor attempt at a joke. If I saw the op I would ask if they gave a female brain one. 
325, Something like that but if you read the bottom it also says. OGA BOOGA CHAD NO LISTEN TO BABY CRY. 
326," I guess thats possible but in my experience they are MUCH more civilized. Like we would whip each other with towels, and uh, do you know what a sword fight is that actually happened. Cheating, that happened, gossip we did that, fights, plenty of those. If I kept listing them it would take a while. "
327, Isnt that the point? Isnt that what ... that area is for? 
328," The difference is, that not like other girls is the difference in a gender. Those boys locker room pictures are about the differences between genders. One is funny and satirical, the other is completely true. Boys locker rooms are fucking wild. "
329," Thats the thing about feminist logic, structurally its perfect. Because by their logic anyone that doesnt agree with them is automatically a misogynistic pig and a rapist. Leaving only people who agree with them and affirm their beliefs, leaving no room for intelligent and logical conversation. "
330," Have fun you two. Always never say no to drugs.drink and drive. You know teen stuff. I ship it, have fun "
331," Mmm I was thinking more, die in a comical mound of cocaine at the top of my penthouse. "
332, Oh I just dont have access. When I do find one nearby Ill drink it. 
333," No no I never meant that fathers are good and mothers are bad, Im saying everyone is shit. Were all fucked up and maybe no one should have kids because we end up suffering when adults cant keep their shit together. "
334," Exactly my dear fellow. Some tricks I use to try and humanize myself in their eyes is fake nightmares, and say that thinking of talking to them stopped the nightmare. They find it endearing and they think they helped you which grows the bond. Oh and make sure not to help them too much, if you do they wont need you, and then youll have to find another one. "
335, No prob bob. But make sure to seem sincere and tortured that way they think youre like them and that way they trust you more. Now go have fun messing with their already fractured minds! 
336," Oh yeah. I know these weak emotion filled people see me as almost a savior. No matter what I say theyll follow me, even sympathize with me. Its actually really amusing you should try it. Just go on almost any r/mentalhealth post and dm them  do you wanna talk "
337, No no I realize it. Im even open with those I help about it. They dont care or dont believe me. 
338," I realized that if I helped people with mental illness feel better about themselves and better their lives, they would shower me with praise and thus fuel my ego. If they happen to feel ok in the process so be it, I dont really care about them. "
339, Not quite sympathy. But a feeling where they got hurt. I quite enjoy watching it in fact. 
340," I chose not to press the button because I gain, and the after effects arent my problem. "
341," I would never hurt my doggies. People on the other hand, or cats......... "
342, I dont drink. 
343, Minor joy at a funny meme. And annoyance 
344, Im just bored in school. But I dont follow any religion 
345," No. Actually in one of my classes we have a random person present a random topic. Everyone is surprised at how well I can do it, because Im just not nervous about it. "
346, Yes I do like people but I dont feel love like you. But for those few that I like I would happily kill for. 
347," Yes. No question about it. You need a nap, a nice calm bath maybe with candles. And whatever else "
348, Isnt that how its said in French? 
349, R/emojipolice PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR 
350, My life is on a constant state of change my father lives six hours away from me I dont see my mother during the week and my step dad is moving away so is my brother. I am unable to cry about it. 
351," No, you are wrong. And to fully explain why, let me tell you a story. When I was about nine or ten my parents got a divorce. At this time, my mother was batshit insane. To the point where she was yelling at me for not doing something she hadnt asked me to do and calling my sister a bitch. She was a stay at home mom. My dad who worked all the time. Couldnt make any time for us because my mother was insane and had a status to uphold. So he had to work all the time we understood and we were fine. But when custody time came rolling around my mother got full custody. Shes fine now having realized my mistake. But in a fair trial my dad would most certainly have gotten custody. I also want to say that my father is my superhero and always will be, he did what he did because he had to. Not because he chose to. "
352, *forty three 
353," I mean it happens with most births. It doesnt mean you arent wanted. Not a mistake, a happy accident "
354, Morally its fine. Legally dont have sex.

359, Ooh ooh Im good a seeing if someone likes you or not. I have a couple questions but Ill dm you to ask 
360, This is a running joke between me and my bff actually. Since I was the one you were looking for. maybe a gold? 
361, I think you should talk to him. June was a while ago. 
362, Can I help? 
363, Dude are you ok 
364, Dang. Oh well thanks anyway. 
365, Yeah thats cool and all but look at how much waste that is.

368," She has a great sword he has a short sword, it doesnt mean he cant win. "
369, Daddy Johns 
370, PAIGE NO! 
371, Just keep in your heart the knowledge that they only shout the loudest because they are the least firm in their belief. By making you believe it it reaffirms their own beliefs. But those who are sure and strong in it say nothing unless it is brought up to them. 
372, First of all this is amazing. Second of all this made me sad because I realized how few of it applies 
373," I dont know a dude that would ever actually say besito. Not because the word is cringe but switching from english to Spanish and back to English is cringe. Spanglish sucks, choose a Language "
374, Men have oppressed womens rights even to her own body!* turns around* Im going to cut of a bit of my sons dick and there isnt anything you can do about it. 
375, Hey thats what I was gonna say.*holds up hand* high five between like minded people? 
376," Ok so Im not sure if this belongs here or not but let me tell you a story. 

When I was maybe seven or eight, I went to the birthday party of a dear friend no name given. The party was held at a video game store/ old style arcade that her father owned. Since the party was at this place it was in a commercial plaza with other stores, and at one point a group of friends including me, started running in the alley behind these stores. Now here comes the fuck up. So about the alley, to my right there was the stores and to the left a fence, in between was tubes and ac units. So the dumb part about the fence is that at the bottom it curved up like a fishhook. So me being the dumbass I was, tripped over one of the ac tubes. I tripped and the fishhook fence tore a huge gash in my leg, like I could see the bone. Like the trooper I was i hobbled out of the alley. At that point the parent supervisor saw my bloodstained jeans and called my mother. That sucked. 

If this goes somewhere else tell me. If I messed up with grammar tell me respectfully in the comments. "
377, He looks so pissed 
378, What are some good meds for sociopaths 
379," You see the death penalty is deeply rooted in religion. It comes from the old belief that hell is the worst punishment of all ever. And if all bad people go to hell. Then the death penalty is sending bad people straight to hell. Im not saying its right, just giving some facts "
380, Yes. Finally.  Someone saying the truth 
381," Yeah I agree. Man spreading on its own isnt an issue but on planes and things try and keep to a minimum guys, Youre making the rest of us look bad. "
382," I mean she does need the car though because yes with two steps she could be there. But only her feet would be there, the rest of her would still be in front of her house "
383," Thanks for this Broski. Also she complained about not being able to find a guy, then named the reasons we say she cant find a guy, then dismissed them like come on "
384, Not to seem racist because Im not but how is this about mens rights? This seems from the title to be about racial equality. Im in class so I cant listen to it now so excuse me if it says something about mens rights in the video. 
385, Saw this at ni.ce K upvotes

393, Im fourteen. High school freshman. To me he looks like maybe a junior or even a senior. 
394, Yes but doesnt just the thought of getting closure and feeling ok with your past make it worth a try. And worst comes to worst she reminds you why you hater her 
395, Samesies bitch. Wanna go on a murder spree? If you say yes I get all the credit though! 
396, I think you should talk to her. Not to forgive her but for closure. Wounds like these can fester and leave scars. Its important to tell her how you feel and what she did to you.

421, In fact I am. 
422," So back when I was in sixth or seventh grade, there was this really fucking stupid bully. The bully was a she, thats important. Now I had a reputation for not taking shit at this school due to my last encounter with a bully and for that reason I was not bullied myself. But one day I was waiting to be picked up with a friend of mine, and she started throwing shit at him. After a while I could tell he was not pleased but wasnt going to say anything himself. So I asked her kindly and politely to stop. She did not. She kept throwing things at him so I asked her to stop again a little less polite this time. She asked me what I was going to do about it and stepped real close to me. I said I really dont want to have to fight you but I will if I have to. She punched my square in the jaw and from there I used my years of karate classes to put her on the ground. We were still on school property so a teacher was called.  Seven other students told the teacher that not only was she bullying my friend and many others but she hit me first. For some reason though she got off with a slap on the wrist and a now dont do that again young missy. And I got like a weeks suspension. Luckily my mom knew the situation so I got ice cream and tv the whole week. "
423," I was always taught as a kid that I was never to start a fight. But if I came to it, beat that mf to hell and back. So it never got explained to me that this rule did not apply to women for some reason. Then I got into a fight with a bully that just happened to be a girl ( long story I might post about it). Then I got suspended and she got nothing l. I was pissed and only then did it get explained to me that I was not to hit a women under any circumstances. Luckily my mom knew that was bs and it was just how the system works. So I still got ice cream and tv during my suspension. "
424, Hating the stereotype doesnt mean they dont fit the box. Sorry to tell you but hist because they say it doesnt make it true. 
425, Oh thanks for letting me know it was deleted. I was about to waste my time asking a question. 
426, I dont even yall go them anymore. I talk to one non family female in my life. If you see this willow youre the best love ya hun have a nice night and dont forget your algebra homework. 
427," Uh hi so what your saying is that. When women actually talk and listen to men. They gain a new different perspective and learn that not everything the learned in their social media is true? Huh, its almost like, oh but I couldnt say it its unthinkable. Well I guess I will maybe. Just maybe. YOURE WRONG. "
428, The thing is no man is good enough for them. They want the all out packages when all they deserve is a garbage bag. Maybe on fire.

508, I meant today I was just wrong. 
509, Dont worry Broski Im here for you. SLEEP IS FOR THE WEAK. *passes out* 
510, Saw this while not paying attention in chemistry lol. 
511, Idk I think thats a dude. Miss me with that gay shit. 
512, We need a sub called not like other dogs 
513, Thats a weird ass hairline for a big sister. That hairline looks like shes 40 so if we assume the mom is at least 20 years older then shes having a baby at 60. If you go by the hairline 
514," Uh isnt today national boys day? Or am I mistaken?

Edit: I google it I was wrong sorry about that. National mens day is November 19. "
515, Imma grab my 7 inch Bowie knife and uh. Go hunting. If any of you wanna come dm me. (This is a joke dont dm me with actual requests to go hunting with me). 
516, Wait you dad or your sons dad? 
517, How do you do the bold thing? 
518, I prefer numb to depressed. Dont you? 
519," Ok sorry about that. I get heated when someone blames a whole issue on men. When I have experience with it not being that way. My neighbors mom tried to stab him. When he was SEVEN. So dont try and say women dont have any part in this. Also I gave her human decency, so I cursed I got heated I did not target or harass her. So chill mod its called an argument and its a normal part of being human. "
520," Ok fuck you. My father did every god damn thing he could to please my mother and she was insane. Never ever say men destroy families as if women have no part in this. Just say families get destroyed, and weep for the children. "
521, Like cocaine Columbia? 
522," Have a friend around at all times. When this happens he should record it. Then once you have enough evidence, you can hit back. "
523, Sweet! Day for the boyz 
524, Australia 100 
525, Yeah call the cops if she comes 
526, Oh thanks. This was a while ago so I just googled it. But Thanks anyway 
527, I was actually in a very similar situation the only difference being that my sister was only the normal level of meant to me just because I was the annoying younger brother. It got better once she moved out because my mom was always least mean to me 
528, Its because they dont need them. Everyone knows about Starbucks 
529, ThE BeLL DOeSNt DiSMiS YoU I DO 
530, Oh thanks Broski 
531, Yes that part seemed real to me its just the term gut flora that seems odd 
532, Gut flora what a psycho 
533, Waifus and when Muslims fight. 
534," Wait.... what? Did.... did you say post birth abortion. That uh, that just sounds like murder with extra steps. "
535," Yeah. But I find that when I ask something here I get very..... interesting, answers. "
536, Mind if I steal this for an art project? No! Ok thanks. 
537, I..... I need him/ her. I can see all the cuddles and shows we will have together.  I CAN SEE ALL THE CUTE 
538, Dude mine is Mac high bulldogs 
539, Mac high? 
540," Dees nuts.
Joe mama
Ben Dover 
So on and so forth "
541," Oh yeah remember that hen she admitted to drugging and robbing men, and NOTHING happened. "
542, Or what about shebagging a less known term that is about the phenomenon where a women puts her purse on another seat or sometimes on two seats. 
543, I have a circumcised who ha and the scar feels weird. I didnt know ven know it was an actual fucking scar until I was 13 1/2 
544, Fucking seven days. She killed a newborn. What the fuck 
545, IM STILL HERE OP 
546, Its babytron 
547, What in hyuk is two spirit 
548,  No its all good my dude 
549, Oh I thought these were things you believed I was like why would he admit that 
550, Weird 
551,  
552, I...  I cant tell if youre joking or not 
553, Ok take the upvote and maybe edit all that stuff in to the post 
554, I mean. Not to be disrespectful to you and shit but couldnt you have just like brought it. You knew you were gonna be going to math class right? 
555, Oh ok 
556, As if. I dont even know how one would contact them 
557, Wait how was the teacher following the girls letting them get their stuff when you couldnt 
558, What even the motherfuck. Is this real 
559, 69 updoots say no 
560, Ha as if I could just *get rid of it* without being absolutely ridiculed for showing emotion. 
561, You are right Im sorry 
562, Its a great drawing but the eyeless dude creeps me out 
563, At least land mines are quick 
564," Yeah, but alas nope. "
565, Well yeah but Im only a teenager I dont know how or who to report too 
566, Mmm no lol this is a school after all. Edit: I only meant that in the way I cant post shit about that part of the body at school 
567, Yeah Ill do the thing 
568, Maybe but she will probably not let me 
569, Wow ok I should make it known it isnt about the heart disease itself it about the fact that the school will take down any posters for men 
570, Oh thanks Broski I just joined 
571, Of course!!! We love anyone intelligent and open to conversation! 
572," A: its sad that youve never done much of that before
B me too "
573, Huh oh no it absolutely sucks. I wish I wasnt tired of it. Im just kinda .... done with it but I have so much longer to go with it. 
574, Yes that too. It just all around sucks 
575, You are strong though in your core you can do this. I dont know how you do it. Im only fourteen and Im already so done with my mask of  being a man 
576," I just want to let you know that no, if you were born female you would not be aware of your privilege. It would have gotten drilled into your head from birth that we are the ones who have privilege. It would be like trying to get out of a cult mindset. "
577, Well Im not a father but I am a son and I can tell you what it means from my perspective. My father will always be my superhero and I love him for it. It means being there to support. It means answering the hard questions mom cant answer. It means going to work and still making time to watch a movie with me. It means so much and there is no chance you could get a glimpse into how much a father loves his child from a post on reddit. 
578, Hes fucking autistic! They do these things. As a whole autistic people tend to be more affectionate and kinder and all that (not all of them) you cant blame this kid when he cant quite think the way you or i do. 
579, If you check it the comment where the mod says it got locked says  sorry the boys couldnt play by the rules 
580, I know 
581, No Ive tried. So have others 
582, Ive been in a similar situation I was just on the other side. My parents used to hate each other and my older sister and I would be caught in the crossfire. It feel in my older sister to make breakfast and hold me when I cried as a kid. 
583, Aww thanks 
584, Oh no they take mens ones down 
585, Maybe my info was outdated sorry. 
586, Yup. 
587, Oh wait sorry I just realized which one this was. I reposted it with some other facts in the title. Like the fact that when someone puts one up for men it gets taken down. 
588, Sorry bad experience causes pessimism 
589, The fact that this is aimed towards women when the issue actually effects not more. Thats what its relevance is. It shows the sexism inherent in the system. 
590, I dont know what youre talking about. Every adult woman Ive met has been very aware of it. While Ive never met a man who said he was watching it. Also you cant take that as a given. Plus it kills men more which means awareness should be more focused at them. 
591, Oh really thats pretty neato I dont use Twitter so I didnt know 
592, MATT SMITH DOCTER IS THE BEST DOCTOR 
593, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
594, Ill do that Ill take a picture of them both Ill put them side by side and shit 
595, Ex: testicular cancer 
596, And it sucks especially because it affects men more then women 
597, All of the above 
598, Of course good man. Go fight the good fight. 
599, I mean Ive been on here for a while Ive just never posted before. 
600," Ah ok yeah that makes total sense. I agree completely, and it sucks that they do this knowingly. "
601, For women its 1/5 of all deaths Is heart disease but for men its 1/4 
602,  
603, I doubt it 
604, Um ok I love the awareness but what does this have to do with my poster. Im sorry I cant make the connection 
605," I mean..,. The cat is a black cat "
606, My school has these type of things all around the school and if anyone puts one up that says men it gets taken down. 
607, You are 100% right Ill comment it right now sorry 
608, Aww 
609, I cant it would get taken down 
610, I agree on its own there is nothing wrong with this one on its own ..... but its a different story when they are all around the school and administrators take down any saying saying men. 
611, The babys look like she ran out of ink lol 
612, Oh ok thanks 
613, I mean ok idk what this has to do with my comment but ok. I know I know Im missing periods and commas and all 
614, Do you know what that green book is? 
615, Maybe because she is trying to force him to give her access to his private documents and stuff. 
616, Welp you work your life away only to have a female tell you it isnt enough and then leave you because the fact that her ever money consuming life style is too much for you. Then kill yourself because she left you while everyone praises her for being strong and leaving an abusive relationship. 
617, My parents are divorced and.... well I love my mom and she is sane now but when it happened she was not. In a truly legal and fair case my father would have gained full custody but my mother did. I love her though just wanna make that clear. 
618, I wanna see her video and how she spun it to be 90 percent of these people are sexist. 
619,  
620,  
621, Exactly. Now you get me( mods this is a joke please dont ban me) 
622, Oh lol I for got about that 
623, I take chem 
624, I would say murder but thats against the rules. I am not not suggesting it though 
625, Im in the USA 
626, Uh no.. no thats not legal. The age of consent is 18 at least here it is 
627," I mean..... this is the exact reason I dont let my mother, Sister, aunt, grandma, take me shopping "
628, Oh ok then you should still go look and upvote my memes 
629, Oh ok then you should still go look and upvote my memes 
630, So you looked through my profile. Thats fine I hope you upvoted my memes. 
631, Okay then go on with your day. 
632, Woooow that must be great. 
633, Huh well now I have to read that one too. 
634, Oh its all hypothetical didnt I say? Im pretty sure I did. Nothing came of it but a tiny scratch on my foot that didnt even draw blood.  If it makes you uncomfortable to see I understand and Ill take it down. I got the response I wanted anyway. 
635, Thats for for what? 
636, Oh ok carry on 
637, Yes but why did you scroll through my profile looking. I saw your comment on the other one 
638, Near the top yes that makes sense. Thanks for your help 
639,  
640, I need a support donkey 
641, Ooh I can hang out!! We can be cutter buddies!!! 
642, Ok 
643, Cool idk that 
644, No its good Broski but thats what you should do 
645, I just read up on this case real quick and it is fuuuged 
646, Oh I meant report him to the actual cops 
647, Im 14 and I dont get 10 hours of sleep??!!! How does it feel to be well rested? 
648, Huh wow have you tried reporting him? 
649, Oh it is watching as the carnage goes down and people pick sides as I sit there with popcorn. I had never thought of making friends with a gossip girl for blackmail though thats a good idea. 
650, That absolutely sucks and should not be legal 
651, Oh because there is so much use for people beyond what is normally seen. Let me explain. Friends buy you food or give you money they also give you answer on homework and sometimes test. As well as my favorite use. Entertainment oh but not the usual entertainment I mean a whisper hear a whisper there and you can get two best friends to hate each other more than anything its quite fun to watch. 
652, No I did know this person and I had known them for a long time. It was painfully obvious it was fake trust me. 
653," Oh no its fine and its probably true too I really do love fire. Plus the teacher who sent me didnt really like me so I suppose he could have just been looking for a reason to send me out. But yes I do have a bet convincing mask. No one suspects Im hiding anything. Im very good at what I do, that being lying and hiding and stealing and such. "
654, No they actually got pissed at me. They thought I was being an asshole. 
655, The top picture is a mood. In fact its my constant mood 
656, One time I called a girl out on it at school. She was in the middle of the cafeteria and it was quite obvious she was saying it for attention. So I pushed through the crowd around her and told her  do you hate getting out of bed every morning. No. And when you wake up do you wish you werent conscious? No.   then shut the hell up because some of us have actual issues 
657, Whered you go friend? I was enjoying our conversation ever so much. 
658, Oh ok but yeah theres a bunch of banned books here 
659, Its not its just a charter school. Which basically means really stuck up public school. I took this picture I didnt just find it. 
660, Well I know that but apparently the school doesnt 
661, I was. I dont know sadly enough I cant read minds and dont know what was running through their heads as the gym teacher called the counselor on me. And what do you mean over exaggerating what they are feeling. 
662, I mean I was freaking out teachers and stuff for me someone to go is usually outgoing and loud ( mask on) to go so quite I dont talk all period was cause for concern enough I guess Im also told I give off a vibe something along the lines of  you seem like you would burn down my house for fun. 
663, The me bothering you part was the part about my mask with it Im very timid and quite very awkward and clumsy. As for going a day without my mask I have once only once. I freaked a lot of people out and it was fun but I got sent to the counselors office and counselors really tic me off so I dont 
664, Im a freshman at my school and I feel like all the upperclassmen hate me for it I dont know why. I dont vape or anything I dont think Im annoying and I know I havent done anything. 
665," Without my mask. Im violent, calculated, and uncaring, as well as scary Ive been told. With the mask Im oh sorry Im bothering you with all these texts arent i. Oh I just sent another one Im so sorry. I cant speak for most sociopaths but personally I have mine because its inviting and makes people feel like they can trust me. "
666,  
667, Well I dont get very angry in the first place so that helps and even if somehow someone does something so horrible it does make me mad I breath first then I close my eyes. If your asking how I scare I do it by singing a song quietly to myself and swaggering over to them with a crazed look in my eyes and an erratic smile. When people see a reaction they dont expect like that their automatic reaction is to perceive it as unnatural and fear it. Once I get close to them I get real close and I whisper into their ears  if you do that again Ill break both of your arms but say it in a low volume so just they can hear. Back up stare at them with a blank face and walk away 
668, No I dont really get outbursts Im calm I find it scares more I dont really do angry either I meant my movement are precise. As in I know how to finely tune my punch to stop less than an inch before I hit I know exactly how to move my hands and such with enough precision to get what I need done. Be that cause fear or pain. 
669, Uh huh sure buddy I love seeing every passing peer as a target I love feeling the intense urge to break and stab. 
670, Personally Im quite calculated. I use my words with precision to cause the most fun (pain) or did you mean physically because yes Im calculating and precise there too 
671, No no its real trust me Im currently in a murderous moment I think if I did have my knife on me right now someones flesh would be cut wether its mine or not. 
672, Oh fine you Debbie downer. Im completely content in my madness you know. And by the way you never answered my original question 
673, Dont got one yet. Not just had my first therapist appointment. Im going to see how long I can keep my ruse of sanity up 
674, Oh you see Im insane and murderous my thoughts are no longer those of the sane. My brain has gone and broke in its place is insanity 
675, Ah that assumes something is causing my pain but no. Im just broken. my brain is shattered in 10 million pieces gone in the wind. You mustnt worry I did say it was all hypothetical after all and I left my knife at home 
676, Oh its all hypothetical of course and uh cant it be a little bit of both. 
677, Are you sure? Cuz Im kinda feeling it ( or not feeling) hypothetically of course. 
678, [removed] 
679," I mean like its rude and mean, but it isnt wrong per say "
680, Haw haw 
681, Do you live with her? 
682," Dont go that hard. The mother just wants to spend time with her child which is a normal thing. She is however taking it too far, she/he should try talking to her about it and how college is for her to experience independence and such. "
683, Do you? 
684, No I love the vampire eyes 
685, I do have good reflexes and while I did report her I dont think anything happened. 
686, HITLER DETECTED HAIL INITIATED 
687, Myself better it worded have couldnt 
688, See I just cant really get with argonians I dont like the eyes 
689, See shit like this is how I end up in jail. 
690, Aww Im glad. On that note would you like to come to my kahjiit orgy afterwards we sacrifice our souls to dagon 
691, Well you should see Monty python go watch the holy grail one. Its on Netflix. What are you doing still reading this?! Go go watch it now 
692,  
693," But 
A: I love orgies
B: I love skooma
C: elves can suck my khajiit dick
D: the lords can have my soul if they want it
E: I went there "
694, Yes that is true however orgies would never be the same if romans hadnt added women. 
695, Is is horny 
696, My thoughts exactly. If you use the poop one youre putting the shit back up your ass 
697, Oh i thought he meant an actual banana 
698, That happened to me and my mom took my computer away 
699, I got banned for posting proof that the wage gap is fake 
700,  No sex was invented by the condom industry to sell more condoms. 
701, No no you mean orgies and you are correct 
702," Yes I agree that is a much better example. And for the people who downvoted me, I didnt say it was right I didnt say it was good I said it was legal. "
703, I like that 
704, See a lot of parenting though cant be taught. A lot of it depends on the kid that comes out. Like spanking or not. I got spanked and it worked but I know for my sister it didnt. 
705, Isnt elderberry a fictional thing from Monty python? 
706, Reddit should be a democracy. We should vote for the admins once a month 
707, 10/10 would boop anyway 
708, Well that sucks and Im sorry I want you to know that I think youre pretty cool. I think your hot. I think youre amazing 
709, I agree with this  you are an amazing person 
710, Not people in truly healthy relationships.  I tell my SO everything I have nothing to hide. You on the other hand.... are what is truly classified as a man hoe and just Incase you didnt know thats bad. Maybe get off reddit you spoiled bitch. I hope you never make that 50k 
711, What do those people who say healthy relationships are built on truth know. Ahh what do they know 
712,  
713, Im very lucky that in my life I have always been given praise for my intellect. The thought that some dont get that motivation sickens me 
714, You say that casually but it shouldnt be a normal thing. You should celebrate intelligence equally 
715, This makes my pp become THE BIG PP 
716, Is it bad that I want one 
717, Mmm could you pass the bowl Im craving some bees 
718, Thanks 
719, Youre pretty great and I hope you have an awesome day 
720, Aww. Man you are just the sweetest 
721, Aww youre too sweet. You know how to make a guy blush 
722, Oh thanks anyway 
723, Frogging weirdos. Do you think you could give me an upvote to bring me back up to 0 
724, Oh ok. Excuse my ignorance Ive only been hunting once 
725, Im an urbanite and I still dont think this is insane. But if you looks at the bird in her hand it isnt going to be enough to eat 
726,  Not insane 
727, But they are gay 
728, I dont know who downvoted you but they are wrong 
729,  
730, See the thing is they dont really want equality. They say they do and they really do.... until it means they have to give up some stuff 
731," Women: we cant stand being away from our babies for so long!

Men: yeah do you think I could please see my children every blood moon I miss them since I can only see them every February 29th?

Women: no you monsters! "
732, Yes you will. There are no other options 
733," I mean to be fair when the child would be getting circumcised, he cant make the decision on his own. Not that this is okay Im just saying what she did is legally ok. And getting the uterus of your baby daughter removed would not be. "
734, I refer to my best bro ( hes a guy) as sis all the time just jokingly 
735, I hate this this is wrong. You can see the pain in his eyes as he talks about how he was forced to be happy about being raped 
736, But I mean Im fucked up and warped anyway so why not add another thing to the list. 
737, Yeah my mom used to be mega insane. And I got used  to not pointing out the crazy and just saying ok mom  and now that she isnt crazy I still have that problem. 
738, This poor kid. As much as I hate school it is important for social and mental growth. It also also important to protect those who are more likely than o get the disease. 
739, No dont worry about it and Mandela effect is having a false memory of something. Like my false memory that its wonderful and not beautiful 
740, Wtf what happened 
741, Oh fuck Mandela effect. I apologize for my mistakes please forgive me i will delete my post and retreat into banishment

743, Oh I wasnt aware. Dont reply Im trying to sleep please. 
744, Ok have a nice night 
745, I dont really think its insane for a mother to say shes missed her child. And its not like she was looking for suitors for you. 
746, Not insane

B: use glare to check for scratches
C: check the ps4 for updates.

756, I love my librarian. I have advisory with her and today she had an appointment so instead of getting us a sub or something she basically cut class short and we all just roamed the halls. I got a bag of Doritos.

761, And you have succeeded indeed 
762, *sweating* uh no 
763, Yeah

770, Happy cake day 
771, Match the posters with similar paint designs 
772, You arent making investments from the time youre one 
773," No, thats not how this works. For something to be your favorite you have to like it more than the other things youve seen. So how can you like it more if youve never seen/read/heard it. You mean the thing that could be your all time favorite "
774, H e l l 
775, Help me Mr. Wizard LMFAO 
776, Idk I think its dumb as fuck 
777, That boy helicoptering 
778, Thats weird dude that really shouldnt be surprising.  And what do you mean its not like ... thats exactly what happened. Also good on you for getting a compliment 
779, Yeah Im kinda done 
780, Really?! Thats weird. I just copied the format of everyone else here. You shouldve seen it coming bro. 
781,  Bro have you had tacos those are the shit. I live from taco to taco 
782, 2 cousins dont count 
783,  
784, And they switch it back whenever it suits them 
785, No problem but uh can I as why 
786, Ok 
787, My door got taken off one time. Yeah I used to have the most fucking insane parents. And it was for the dumbest shit I think it was that I was having trouble pushing the trundle bed back under my bunk bed and my mom called me fat and lazy and stupid I WAS FUCKING SEVEN so I did the normal kid thing and cried she then got so mad that I was crying she told my dad to take off my door. Fun life. Note my family is much better now 
788, Ha ha dude the kid isnt getting vaccines we dont have to worry about it turning 18 
789, Back before my parents divorced if my mom got woken up or if anyone woke her up she would go on a rampage it was horrible. Shes better now but to this day I have a paralyzing fear of waking people up. For example: my father snores bad and he only has a one room apartment with one bed (its a long story)  so we have to share the bed and he always says just wake me up if Im snoring to bad. But I just cant do it and I end up not sleeping all night. 
790, Because makes have been made out to be sexual monsters and women can do no wrong. When a woman looks at a man the man gets happy because she has graced him with her divine beauty when a guy looks t a girl hes a creep and a weirdo even if she is wearing two dimes and a dorrito if you know what I mean. 
791, I agree 
792, I feel like this isnt quite trashy per say its more just gross and a bit distasteful. 
793, Actually that video got removed 
794," No Im only on episode like t or three because I have to watch it in secret, due to the fact that my parents wont let me watch it. "
795, Are you actually trying to speak Spanish or is this a joke. Im curious

820, DRAGON 
821, Yes I concur. Another rule is if someone ask for help try to help as best you can. 
822, No no that is a bad rule. 
823, Oh no problem. did I help you? 
824, That really sucks but if they didnt seem mad I dont think you have anything to worry about 
825," Is he neutered? That helps with aggression a lot. If not try to do that immediately. Did the guy seem mad? Did you get his number? If you did try to invite him over to your house to apologize serve cookies and lemonade, and grovel without making obvious that you are groveling "
826, Ah yes make fun of the younger generations as well for they are too small to join our glorious ranks. 
827, Whats with the post op are you good. 
828, Yes I do concur these are the rules but you mustnt forget Karen bad as well. 
829, Thanks kind sir and I already have. Ill be watching for anything out of the ordinary but I like to think the best of people. 
830, Thanks that should work 
831, Hey so I have kind of an awkward thing to ask. I know you said I helped you earlier in your first reply but the auto bot didnt pick it up I think I had to be in its own little sentence at the end. Do you think you could just please kinda respond with helped.

837, Im looking for any teenage friends to talk to dm me if you think we could be friends. 
838, Hey so they dont seem like your friends they seem like bitches. Just wanna point that out 
839, Yes that makes sense. Anyway Im glad I could help you. 
840," Thats good, thats very good . do you have any other passions? "
841, Im sorry to say it like this but some people just live off causing pain in others. Try surrounding yourself with new people. 
842, Ok listen and listen good. Staying in is bad for you it may seem more comfortable or better but it isnt. Find some way to go out just little things at first like taking a walk or anything. 
843, It may be about your surroundings. Try using online dating. If you dont mind me asking how exactly do they treat you badly? 
844, Yeah thats pretty important personally I find they tend to bloom right next to my ps4/Nintendo switch/Xbox 360. As well as near books. 
845, Nope there are no options. Your life is worth living. There is help out there. And above all I may not know you you may be a stranger on the internet but I fucking love you and I need you to know that. 
846, No prob I love being helpful but you need to remember not to study too hard. It can become easy to lose yourself in the books but dont. Always make sure to stop and smell the roses. 
847, Well you def have to warn her. Make her aware of his bad tendencies and try to make him aware of them as well but for the most part Im sorry there isnt much you can do 
848, The first thing you need to do is the most important. You need to calm down. I know it may seem like that is the last thing you want to do but trust me. Right now there is nothing you can do. And for your gap year along with hanging out with your friends try to study for the coming year if you walk into that school with the knowledge to walk through with ease it will be much better. Also have like a bike or a scooter or something to get around campus to save gas on the car.

881," Why would you do that. We just want a place full of supportive people to bare our pain to or to talk to when were lonely. You suck, or at least that sucks. You should stop. Are you even a teenager. "

896, Ok then Ill keep watch. 
897, Reddit and archerio. 
898, Im not sure you know what the word accidentally means. Sure being curious is human nature no so is literally killing cute animals. Im not kidding thats why your body says squeeze when you see something cute. Humans have been resisting their nature for eons in favor of functioning society. 
899, Yeah sure. Lets see what you can come up with. Im open to the idea it might be real. 
900," How do these people think this is ok. They want no sexism but to do that we need get this, sexism "

917, Its been 90 days are you still looking 
918, Ha ha thats why I plan to die at 23 you losers gonna live a full life. 
919, No lunch is when I eat. Or when I do the homework I was too fucking tired to do the night before. 
920," The fuck teachers do you have. I wish I could, Im already like a week ahead so if I slept nothing bad would happen. "
921, I go to bed at 10 Im just constantly spent. Not quite physically every time but emotionally and intellectually. 
922," A: idk if youve ever seen a five year old chase her brother around the house but it can go on for hours and hours.

B: as a high school kid I can guarantee you I do not have any time for naps. I wake up at 6:50 in the morning go to school I dont get back home till like 6:30 then I have to do a mountain of homework and be in bed by 10 only to repeat it all over again. Given I go to the hardest high school in my town. but still I do not have time for any naps whatsoever unless I want to take them during chemistry or geometry. "
923, God I hate that. 
924, Oh god is roblox porn really a thing?! 
925, I think hentai is one 
926, Hentai for the win 
927, The on. He is woke

936, I know that dude. But I didnt know that you didnt make it. Anyway have a mice day imma go eat now. 
937, Ik all that but I just wanted to know why you gave your monstrosity one. 
938, Whats the double op? 
939, Yup. Met a girl named Hannah who believed she was a cat person. 
940, This is just so extra fucked 
941, Yup my inability to focus and near constant hyperactivity is somehow caused by the government. FUCK BIG PHARMA. 
942, That final text almost made me throw up. To tell your own son to kill himself is.... utterly and completely insane as well as incompetent. 
943, See in some special occasions its ok. Like my mom made me put that life 360 app on my phone and I really dont mind. Its just for my safety in case she cant find me or something. I did some hacker man shit so I get a notification when she checks in on me and she never uses it. 
944, Fake 
945, Ok so yeah wtf. thanks bro this makes it much clearer. 
946, I think we all know what she uses that lone cucumber  for boys 
947, Insane 
948," Thats fair, I understand now. Thank you kind stranger for this pleasant conversation but I must go now as I am in class. "
949, I mean he isnt wearing any clothes. 
950, Oh no problem I love to help out and yes you should try just dont worry too much. Hate those fines dont we 
951, Oh yes definitely if you live in a place like that the collective is against you. But that isnt always a bad thing. To be mad in an insane world is not madness it is sanity. 
952, 10/10 would buy a poster of him and put it in my room. 
953," I have no idea but cats are built for doing exactly that. Their tails help them balance and their paws are specialty made to cling to things. Although it is smart to watch out for them, I wouldnt worry too much. "
954, Dude mansplaining isnt real those people dont know what theyre saying and I may not have been there but Im sure your presentation was just fine. It is literally the job of the person presenting to explain everything like you are teaching the class. Im sure you were fine. 
955, It was probably in oil form but still even for epilepsy at that age your brain is so sensitive even in oil form ( because Im sure they didnt pass him a joint) it is going to have harmful effects. 
956," Skyrim because its amazing. The game almost never ends giving you countless quests to do once you beat the game. Plus you get to a certain point of power where nothing can kill you and youre just a god, that part feels amazing "
957, Yeah but still. Like the other stuff Ive heard of before but giving a four year old weed is like next level insane to me. 
958, Yeah but still. That baby is still growing and developing. 
959, Around four 
960, Neither. My father is a bigot and my mother is a manipulative person... which I guess but if I had to choose I choose mom. Im just closer to her 
961, Hey I learned that one real young! Oh wait thats a bad thing right? 
962, I used to but not anymore 
963, Fuck sports I just cant care enough about them to get into it. 
964, Ive met these people. They see my cold indifference and get obsessed with me. I think they are attracted to me because they think in my coldness they can stay by me for safety I dont like these people and see them as cowards and worms beneath me. Although if they come to me and ask for protection I will give it for a fee this is well know at my school. 
965, Like is a strong word Ive stolen a fuck ton of money from my best friend but another friend of mine I would never not because I just like her that much or anything. It is because logically I want to keep one shred of my humanity left. I do that by choosing one person conforming my personality to suit theirs and they become my person. I am currently choosing a new person and when I do that I can drop the old one. 
966," Dont praise it trust me if your money goes missing you know one. If your friends stories arent adding up, you know one. I am genuinely by most peoples standards a horrible person just objectively. Stop being edgy and shit. God dang I dont feel anger and you still annoy me "
967, I dont make many decisions with emotion. I do them without giving it the proper thought but not with emotion. 
968, Dont be jealous because of the stigma. if I told anyone what I am they would automatically assume I will hurt and steal and lie... given that is true in most cases but dont assume shit. Like what if I was on meds for it and you just made me a social pariah for no reason. 
969," Im not diagnosed but I suspect it highly based on a very set of traits I have. And as for embracing it I dont give a fuck, I will use you to get what I want and I will do it again and again. Im good at it too "
970, Oh uh well then. That answers the question I came on this sub with. Thank you 
971," Im recently noticing my sociopathic tendencies, such as my near lack of real emotion, my manipulativeness my compulsive lying and stealing as well ass a complete lack of care for other human being and most animals( dogs are my weak spot) "
972, I do I love my doggys and honestly nothing else. 
973, I dont have a solution for nihilism. I love it I subscribe to it. If nothing matters then I get to do whatever the fuck I want. And if it does Im still going to do whatever the fuck I want. 
974, In my experience yes. And no at the same time. Ive been around not normal girls my whole life and none of them knew I was sociopathic. Also sociopaths arent genuine we lie all the time and change our personality to get you to like us so we can get what we want. 
975," Good question. I do find myself compelled to study a person but not because they seem interesting or things like that, but to better shape my personality to get what I want. "
976," Nope I dont really have relationships, its more fuck buddys to fill my needs "
977," 29 but then again Ive never been in a marital relationship or anything, some of these questions dont apply to me. "
978, Not really because since I cant really feel much I cant feel bad for the things I do and if I dont feel bad why would I care enough to stop. 
979,  Not really. I lie cheat steal and all of it means nothing but a fleeting thrill afterwards I think of nothing but the next object do break or person to steal from. 
980, Not much more than nominal but yes. My mother and my friend. I respect them because they are the only ones who make me actually feel 
981, Yeah I got like 4 of the very outer ring ones 
982, It is true that Im some cases I have read they do use aborted fetal dna BUT the fetus was already planned to be aborted it was that or nothing. Might as well help some of us breathers over here 
983, I mean at least he tried something right. Ive never been given anything like this from my parents for lunch on 9/11 
984, My Abue always comes to my house when Im sick to give me a big hug of her special lemonade it always makes me feel better 
985, See this isnt your fault though its bad formatting you read left to right not top to bottom this isnt China

1004," Idfk bro, they were probably too insecure to go on stage. "
1005, Yeah thats insane. For you to be out of state and her be saying she needs to know what your doing. 
1006, It depends how old are you? 
1007, Mm no 
1008,  
1009," This is nothing. This is an over reaction. It is perfectly normal to want to make sure. If he had told you he wasnt sure they were his even though he still loves them with all his heart, you would have freaked out. Ive seen the situation. did you talk to him about it after finding out l? "
1010, The words are ok but the picture is the problem 
1011, Women can do whatever that fuck they want and nobody can do anything. That sucks ass 
1012, Yes 
1013, Ima baaaad guy. Duh 
1014, Yup this happens and it kinda makes me mad 
1015, Bitch tell me something new 
1016, You ever been on r/insaneparents ? 
1017, No problem have a nice day bro. 
1018, Yes 
1019,  But I have no friends 
1020, Yeah I did and I saw it. I just dont remember doing it twice but I guess i did 
1021, Thats not how that works bro 
1022, The next day sucks bad tho 
1023, Oh yeah I guess I did. Thats strange I dont remember doing that twice. 
1024, Naps 
1025, Sorry the wording was bad on it what I meant was its a place to have some fun and do dumb shit. Nothing too horribly bad but cursing with your friends and teasing your pals its fun its a place to find yourself. 
1026, I agree very much. I mean its not like Im doing anything super duper bad but still 
1027, Ttyl bro night 
1028, Nah its all good. Listen man its getting late here I gotta go Ill dm you in the morning cuz you seem like a cool guy/girl and I wanna keep talking 
1029," Ok so Im in high school now (not going to say which grade), but when I was in 8th grade I took choir and ooooohhhhh boy let me tell you guys about this abusive horrible person.  I hear you typing oh how bad could she have been, your probably over reacting, well no so hold ur thumbs and listen to my stories. 

Ok so lets call her Mrs. Martinez (not her real name). so when I walked into that class on the first day of school I thought it was going to be a cool class because there was only 9 people in the entire class, ( thats important later). so this teacher would have regular breakdowns, and I know that doesnt sound that bad, I dont know what was going on at her home so it could have been for a good reason. Although when you start calling students shitty kids and disrespectful for talking when she said we could. Or for getting water while we were on break then you cross the line but that isnt the worst of it. She chose three people for some random reason and berated is constantly it was me my friend Lauren and Gemma. Gemma got the worst of it to the point where the teacher would make her cry openly in class, and Gemma had told us that she had cried at home too and at one point I decided fuck it this isnt right we have to report her to the principal. So the three of us went to the counselor because the principal was never anywhere to be found and told her about what had been happening to us. There know you know everything you need to know about for me to tell you what happened next.


Me:mega erection. L:Lauren. G:Gemma. T:teacher 




So we walked into class and the teacher was late so we all sat down in our assigned spots.the teacher bursted through the door and...


T: ok who the heck reported me to the counselor!

(My whole class was just facing forward and she was behind us) 

T: well who was it! You might as well tell me because I have an appointment with the principal and Im just going to ask her. Shell tell me!

( that is very wrong when you go to the counselor it is super confidential and they arent allowed to tell anyone)

M:(quietly to Lauren) fuck it Im going to tell her it was me so shell shut up.

L:no dont do it youll get in trouble.

M:fuck it Im so done I dont care.

G:m no dont 

( I then stood up and turned around to face the teacher) 

M: you know what T it was me I reported you because you consistently stop class for your breakdowns. Which I can handle but you make Gemma cry every week.

T:Im giving you a referral!

M: do it I havent done anything wrong. If Im suspended Ill spend my days eating ice cream watching 

T:tries to slap me.

M: grabs her hand before she can touch me.

she then fell on her desk and cried. She called the office to send an aide to replace her as she was too emotionally distraught to teach. You should know the aides help the disabled kids. So when she got over herself and went on the aide got there she just sent the aide back waisting valuable time the aide could have used to help disabled kids.

I dont even have access to the email I had when I bought it what can I do? Am I screwed? "
1039, Ok so let me explain something my mom and aunt are adopted but not traditionally. So originally my Abue (grandma ) was married to my bio grandfather and they had 2 kids my mom and my aunt but they got a divorce and my Abue met my current grandpa and married him as a show of love he adopted my mom and aunt to make them a legal whole family. So apparently my bio grandfather did some pretty bad shit and Ive only heard about like 2 things but apparently he did something so bad at some point that was supposedly the last straw on my Abues marriage but its a huge family secret what he did. To this day I have not been told what he did and anyone I ask refuses to tell me anything. They just shake their heads and say its not my secret to tell. Im not sure if this is this the right sub to put it on please give me orange arrows and English isnt my first language so be kind. Have a nice day

1050," So Im a teenager and my birthday just came and I got a new iPhone XR to replace my old shitty Samsung. the next day my mom took me to the nearest AT T to get it activated and get a new case, but while I was there, there was also another man there he was behind us so I didnt quite get all of it but from what I understood he came in and was asking to buy a SIM card, but as store policy they will not just give you a SIM card they need the device and will switch the cards in house, and he was getting pissed off he was yelling at the lady helping him and yelled at the poor girl for the manager when he told the man the exact same thing he flipped the fuck out. he was yelling and shit all around the store so the manager asked him to leave, he would not so my mother and I having finished activating my new phone, were walking out and he looked to my mom talking to the manager and said ask this lady Im not being disruptive why should I leave and my mom replied you are being an asshole and you should get out  he then called corporate to file a complaint as we walked out.
