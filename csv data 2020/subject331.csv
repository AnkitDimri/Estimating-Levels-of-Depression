0," Answers don't match the questions. College education has no gender as far as I know. But my income could well be ""no"". "
1, How is once a year the lowest possible amount to visit a health professional in a year? 
2, Mark Williams was ranked 16th in 1997 and I think he had never qualified before that 
3," I would specialize in birds, reptiles and insects. As it's way too cold here, it would either be mainly inside plus nice pastures during summer or I would have to move to a warmer country "
4, The goth is here to stay 
5, I won a summer job at a tech competition. Sadly the job turned out to be marketing and as I am a young woman they wanted me to do social media stuff and marketing emails etc which I'm totally clueless about. Fair to say I was pretty mad and also totally useless. IT department then rescued me as it was a small company and everyone knew eachother 
6," ""Women who drink and dress provocatively deserve what they get."" What am I supposed to answer here? If they get compliments, a nice pet, a raise or find a partner sure they deserve it, but if this is  implying  harassment then absolutely not. "
7, Iceland 
8, Alfred J. Kwak 
9," Lovely! So many sighthounds, I was certainly lucky "
10, 12  per hour or 50  a month for unlimited play at the local club. At least the tables are amazing and the club is near my apartment so no additional travelling costs 
11," Why nearsighted and farsighted are the only options? I'm neither, but wear glasses for astigmatism "
12, Pretty funny questions for a maths student 
13, I lost it when I chose to do statistics on top of pure maths. Now I just want to become a peacock farmer and forget everything. 
14, There's no option to take no medication for a headache 
15, Paying for composting? I probably would if it wasn't a free service and now I'm confused and realized it might not be free everywhere 
16, Wearing glasses. Retrospectively thinking that should be pretty obvious. I rarely need my glasses for everyday activities but there's enough astigmatism to throw off depth and angles. Who would have thought that might impact my game...  
17," I don't really know how to feel about physical contact. It doesn't bother me at all, but I definitely wouldn't say I like it. Luckily showing affection is not a big deal in my culture "
18," Yes, but the following questions don't make any sense if your family is indeed totally non-religious. Some sort of NaN option would maybe solve the issue "
19, Only people with religious family and upbringing can answer this 
20," I love darkness, but hate everything else about winter. October and November are perfect as long as snow stays away "
21, He would solve 90% of Europe's problems ...or wait was it less than 10% 
22, It felt like finding an easy and obvious answer to a really complex question. Also the way I viewed relationships pretty much immediately changed. It wasn't some annoying must do thing that the society had cursed upon everyone after all... 
23," It's possible to use more than one operating system, so I couldn't answer "
24," Potted yellow along the cushion almost the whole lenght of the table and from a pretty bad position to begin with, but I had a nice lead and decided to go for it anyway. I was so excited I missed the next easy green by a mile...

Highest break is 15 but I'm getting better (hopefully) "
25," I have experienced that weird rib thingy. I can feel one of my lower ribs shift and move when wearing a corset and quite often without a corset too. My lower ribs flare out a bit and are quite flexible which could probably cause the odd movements.

About the sore back, I remember my Orchard corset having a very straight and stiff back and it took some extra work to slightly bend it to my natural curve. Maybe the fit just isn't quite right "
26," Switzerland (French speaking part)

How unorganized can you be, seriously? Also heavily armed police always frightens me and I start to worry about why they are needed. "
27," After sauna I jumped naked into snow. The snow had a really sharp crust, almost like glass. Cut both my shins pretty badly "
28, Star Wars 
29," Nope. It would take nearly an hour by bike now that I checked some possible routes. There's absolutely nothing but swamps, two motorways, a gigantic cemetary and an aiport between my home and the campus. The bus uses the motorway so it's really quick "
30," Russian, Python, embroidery and snooker.  "
31, 10 minutes by bus and that's literally my only option to get to the campus. Walking is not an option as there is a motorway and an airport blocking my way
