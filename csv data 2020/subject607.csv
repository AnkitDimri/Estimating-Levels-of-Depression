Sanity Breaker - [2] (/2) [U] (/U) [B] (/B)

Creature - Specter

Whenever ~ deals combat damage to a player, that player reveals their hand, then you may pay [1] (/1) [U] (/U) [B] (/B). If you do, you may exile any number of non-Vampire, non-Werewolf, non-Zombie creature cards from that players hand. You may cast any cards exiled with ~'s effect.

*****

This is probably the chunkiest card I've made so far. You may notice revealing the hand doesn't have a cost, the exiling does. This is in case the opponent has no creatures in hand, so you don't waste mana for nothing. Other than that Victim of Night was hard to implement in an interesting way. "

28," Actually, according to the MTG wiki,

 ""Strictly better"" status is not dependent on creature type. More generally, such comparisons between cards are made independent of any particular board state. Therefore, because of the sheer number of possible gameplay circumstances, for any given ""strictly better"" card, there is typically some imaginable set of circumstances in which it is, in fact, inferior to another card that would otherwise rank below it. This fact implies that a ""strictly better"" card might be more accurately termed ""typically better"", and that distinction sometimes confuses newer players. However, ""strictly better"" is well understood among experienced Magic players, and is the prevailing description of such a relationship between cards.

For example, [[Lightning Bolt]] is strictly better than [[Shock]]. Both are instants, both cost {R}, and both can target either a creature or a player, but Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage, whereas Shock deals only 2 damage. Although Shock would be preferable to Lightning Bolt if, for example, your opponent controls a [[Mogg Maniac]] that you need to kill while you have 3 life, this doesn't preclude Lightning Bolt from being ""strictly better,"" as said circumstances are incredibly niche.

35," Sadly, I've got no idea. There isn't any cards that can remove the subtype of basic lands yet, so no ruling exists. "
36," TBH, to me it sounds like this would fit perfectly in some wacky suburban comedy. Also that's the stupidest way I've ever heard to determine assholeness. Antagonist does not mean asshole, and protagonist does not mean not the asshole. "
37," ~~I believe that lands would be unaffected.~~ (Ninja Edit: Nope! The basic land subtypes are what actually add the  {T}: Add [mana] to the land. So if a land is just a basic land with no subtypes, it can do absolutely nothing.)

Equipment has rule 301.5c which states ""An Equipment that loses the subtype Equipment cant equip a creature.""

Auras have rule 303.4k, which states ""An ability of a permanent that refers to the enchanted [object or player] refers to whatever object or player that permanent is attached to, **even if the permanent with the ability isnt an Aura.**""

Sagas are tough, because no rule or ruling exists stating that sagas do or do not work without the saga subtype. However, I will use my personal rules lawyer opinion to say that since Sagas enter with a lore counter, the saga would enter and not add a lore counter. All this would do is delay the saga by a turn, since afterwards it becomes a saga. Sagas already on the battlefield would not be affected, since the adding of a lore counter happens during the draw step, before cards can be played. "

[[Blue Sun's Zenith]], [[Braingeyser]], or any other draw spell: Hope your opponent has really big hands or a way to get cards back in the deck, because with these draw spells your opponent has their entire deck in their hand.

[[Empty The Pits]], [[Secure The Wastes]], etc.: What if you wanted to go to heaven, but god said ""I spend 30 mana on the X cost for Secure The Wastes, so I have 30 1/1 Soldier tokens.""

[[Epic Expirement]]: Play 25% of your deck in 1 sorcery! No, seriously, if you have 10 mana you can just play every instant and sorcery that happens to be by the top of your library.

[[Hangarback Walker]]: Deal with a 20/20, or 20 1/1 flyers...hmm. Hangarback Walker is already an extremely good artifact without infinite mana, so making it a beast that, when killed (if it can be), creates a buttload of Thopters.

[[Malicious Advice]]: Tap your opponent out completely. Takes too much life? Who cares? You're opponent isn't going to be attacking you or anything.

125," If you mean how a dialect or accent is different from the standard speech, then I can answer that. For an accent, most of what makes an accent has it's roots in phonemes or phonology. For a dialect, it gets a little bit more complicated. My current understanding of it is a dialect differs more than an accent (which could mean syntax, morphology, pragmatics, etc.) but a person that speaks the standard form of that language can still understand it. Of course, one of the largest mysteries in linguistics is how to determine a dialect from a language, but that's a can of worms to open some other time. "
126," A dialect is a specific form of a language different from the ""standard"" way of speaking, while an accent is just a different way of pronouncing the dialect/standard language. General English is not changing the English language phonetics-wise, it just changed how those words are pronounced.

When there were 2 other spy claims (both bm'er, fyi) I can somewhat see the logic, but the problem was I was jailed N1 so I couldn't prove I was visited by maf.

Our Pyro was the first one to think we were unprepared, we only had a ringer for an engie, the demoman had family problems (nothing wrong with that, but he was the best player) meaning the captain wanted to not play. The solo queue message was posted when I was asleep too, so I have to be a ringer. Since my computer sucks I make a bad ringer due to not being able to connect quickly in a pinch, and combined with only being at best meh with Heavy, a class you don't really need ringed in, I have to also ring as Sniper because I want to play.

437," The story starts in England. There's a (kinda stupid) myth that a house on 1313 Dead Drive is a neverending house, filled with your worst nightmares. A load of bollocks, right? My friend went in there once and left a bit shook, but he's been normal ever since. Well, about as normal as a guy who nearly ripped out his eyeballs.

The dark mansion frightened and fascinated me. I wanted to see it but my parents knew what was in there. They would tell me stories about how an old man lived in the house and was a revolutionary scientist. He made the house neverending, but he got trapped in it when he forgot his keys. Poor sap.

1313 Dead Drive was hardly the spookiest place in England, but the ""infinite house"" got me wondering. The house was no small hut, but certainly not infinite. Not a single window in sight on it. The house was one faded grey all over and wasn't up for sale, despite there being no signs of life anywhere. Unless you count disturbing monsters, then certainly. 

Nobody would be surprised if you didn't want to enter. The ghost stories spread like wildfire, and no one actually knew if it was infinite. Every time somebody entered, they exited, albeit a little shook. Some imagined it like Hell, all of your worst nightmares in that building. People reported hallucinations, but that was just things they weren't afraid of. And only their friends saw them. Strange.

I think I needn't go further, so let's talk about what the inside is. Like it was straight from Scooby-Doo the door behind me slams and locks itself. And no windows, remember? This was a bad idea, but there must be some way out. I bought a pocket knife with me in case of the door locking, but it wouldn't unlock. I was in a dark room, with 3 doors leading out of it. I decided to go straight, but it went on for about 9 hallways before I got to the end. Much smaller looking on the outside. I realized I was in a maze of a house. I ran back to the door to try unlocking it again but there was no door. The house had changed while I was inside of it. I started frantically running, only stopping at a room where there was a giant worm, much too big to fit into the room. It's body covered the entire wall, and I was extremely scared at this point. I ran straight into a wall, seeing a door decal on it. At this point, I had gone mad, or the guy who lived here went mad. The giant worm left the room, but it left a scrawled out message on the wall just saying ""I was your chance"". After that, I heard a door open and the worm wriggling out of it. I ran towards it, but the worm closed and locked the door before I could get out.

I got up (somehow) and headed off to work, where I was fired because they got a better employee. And this was all before 12:00. So from noon until 5:00 everything's okay. Then someone calls me and says he has my credit card. I check my wallet and no credit card. He said that I have until August to send him $2,000 dollars.

Back to the story. They were showing an odd squiggle that even the best archeologists couldn't decipher. But quickly I realized that it was my own signature. I was expecting it to appear one day.

But it would likely ruin my life. Everyone would think, ""This guy's signature is just like the squiggle on the news!"" and think I'm a copier.

Either that or they find out I have a time machine. If they do though, I will get them, one by one.""

""Was that a good story?"" Gary said to his boss, Jacob.

""*Mmmmm, mmmm mmmmm mmm mmm*!"" he replied, muffled by the tape on his mouth.

He should be more grateful. That's probably going to be the last story he hears.

I do think my view is changed enough by you for me to think sleep is vital.  
731," They are equal options, since you spend a third of your life sleeping. "
732," Sleep is as we all know vital to the human body. But humans could have easily evolved without the need to sleep. They could be solar powered for all I care, just the fact that we need to not do anything or see anything for according to studies, 7 to 8 hours a day^foradults sounds just silly. And I personally just don't think the suggestion of ""Well you need to recharge your brain-power"" or garbage like that because there are better ways. Sunlight, wind, coal for all I care could recharge our brain better.

I'll send 5 people country flags. Just a note: don't ask for a specific country. It's likely I didn't draw it. Just a different note: They are poorly drawn because I can't draw. "

thanks much "
767," I have realized that the ""So is any other dogecoin related information."" is very vague, with many posts that have close to nothing related to dogecoin, except for donations with dogecoin. There was a post for Donald Trump to build a house, but it was almost NOTHING about dogecoin, except for ""The dogecoin community has done some amazing things"". There are a lot of great rules, but this one is a bit vague. "
768, Aaaaaaand it's super cheesy. Why am I such an stupid shibe...

778,  
779," There is no other place, I checked. "
780," Toledo, Ohio and maybe, but I probably couldn't afford it. "
781," Soooooo, my idea was that we could buy trees, fruits, and other plant-like stuff with doge. But The-Seagull (quick shout-out, go read his/her/their/it's post) already did, so instead we're going with plan B. Toys for children without well, toys. Just helping children in general, with doge. Stuff like dolls, bears, clothes, shoes, clean water, donating to charities, books, food, all that stuff. I personally think it might be a bit big, but just save up your doge. More doge = more stuff. Y'know, for the kids! Dogecoin has no cap too, so no cap on stuff to buy!

And you read through my idea, you deserve a doge medal. "

""But they're good for you!""

""What if someone heard us?""

""I don't know what would happen.""

""Of course you don-Oh hey boss!""

""he's behind me isn't he"" "
791," I would say yes, all the way. Dogecoin is pretty much free (but you can buy it) and there is a great community for it. "
792," I wanted to weigh the pros and cons of Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Quick note, I have limited experience with bitcoin but have used dogecoin. Expect more detail from Dogecoin's part.

Bitcoin Pros:
Very common, and many places allow you to convert it to USD, EUD, etc.
Cons:
A worse community than dogecoin, a cap on the amount in circulation, and it absolutely FLOODS dogecoin faucets.

Dogecoin Pros:
It's easy to collect with great faucets like moondoge, has no limit on amount in circulation, and has a great community without a negative attitude.
Cons:
It isn't as popular as Bitcoin and had a rough start. But that's about it.

In all, I believe that Dogecoin is rather superior to Bitcoin. I also sadly won't do a Litecoin comparison for...reasons. "
793, It uses Vircurex now. 
794," yeah, but it's only eu dollars
what about americans "
795," I was dankly meming one Sunday night when I thought ""What about Doge?"" I was on the chrome store so I search up doge and came across DOGE Pricer. I got it of course and decided to use it. I came to this subreddit after doing some more research on them. I came here because it had lots of shibes and other subreddits didn't fit me. Also I'd like to recommend a DOGE Pricer thing built onto the side, which means I'd like the rate of DogeCoin to Bitcoin, USD, EUD, etc.  "
796,  
797," Like send and receive tips, and those other goodies.  "
798," Can block.io connect with this reddit? If so, how? "
799," Is there a feature in any language (yes, any) that's unique to that language? "
800," ""I shall not be judged!""

""OBJECTION!"" "
801, It kind of is. I took Armenia's flag and *SNAP* corrupted. 
802," How it formed was, Turkey and Armenia joined up to attack Cyprus. But in the middle of the battle, Armenia tried to take the land away from Turkey. They succeeded in taking over Northern Turkey, but Cyprus let Armenia have the rest of the land, not wanting another war. They changed to flag to reflect that Armenia had taken over the island.  "

822," Lol, my story is there was a CP like 7-800 eevee. I was using 15 greats and 20 regulars. Plus about 25 berries. Then I was waiting to finally catch it then my game crashed It reappeared but it was only CP 600. Didn't catch that either. "
