0, In my top 5 for sure. It may be the most postmodern episode of Trek. It certainly is of TNG. 
1," Whats funny about this is that the week before (and maybe even earlier that night), Scott Hall was making fun of WCW fans as NASCAR-loving rednecks. "
2, I just watched the one where data is having nightmares; its quite scary. 
3," Yes! Thats the greater point of Dookus directions- only engage when victory is assured. If he can push fear into the hearts of any Jedi, the dark side can root its way in. "
4, They had me in the first half not gonna lie 
5, THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY 
6," You of course have the choice to not vote, which is what most Americans do. "
7," Rebels is a lot better than it should have been, and for what people give it credit for. But I agree that a deadline or limitation creates the greatest art. Lets hope this final season of clone wars rips. "
8," I believe Dooku told Greivous to never fight *any* Jedi 1 on 1, because the chances  we top great that he would lose and he was too important to the confederacy compared to any one knight or master was to the republic. This is why he runs all the time and why Kenobi and Mace Windu are always referring to him as a coward. Think about it- he never squares up for a fair fight and is always running every time you see someone confront him. "
9, I have to remind everyone every other day- most powerful Jedi who ever lived. 
10, :-p good call 
11," Damn, thats a lot of switches and knobs. Hope it sounds as good as it looks! "
12," Yes the number of us who use nothing more than basic physics in our work, much less the number of us who dont use any scientific principles *at all* is the vast majority. Lighting guys dont even use the word engineer, they say director, those who mix and make beats usually prefer producer even though it also is sorta technically inaccurate. Most of us are making what are essentially artistic decisions rather than technical ones. No other roles like ours call themselves engineers. "
13," Where I grew up, one of my middle school (age 11-13) band directors had a home school band that she ran for all the kids who played but were in home school. I dont know what grades she did, but in our parts you most certainly could not split up home school and public school like that. I dont even understand what the diploma process for home school is like. "
14," Yes, Im willing to bet that less than 10% of the people posting in this thread are true engineers. "
15, Aw  
16," The school let her only attend certain classes, and otherwise hs the rest? The school will grant a degree to her missing those credits? Does the school grant credits gained at home? Sorry this is all very bizarre to me. "
17," Yea Im aware of the college dual enrollment, but your post makes it seem like you do certain classes in the public school, and certain ones at home school. "
18," Damn, crosspost this at /r/CurlyHair that hairdo takes work and looks *great*. "
19," Ive never heard of partial homeschooling. What country are you in, and how exactly does that work? "
20," Hell yeah man. Day 1 is the hardest. It bears repeating. Before I stopped, I cant remember the last time I had just 1 beer in a day. That really is an accomplishment.  And for a lot of people, stepping down is the best way to go (sometimes even medically necessary). You made most of the day today with nothing. You now know firsthand what you are facing. When you are ready, your only goal that day is hit the pillow with 0% booze that day. You will say I choose not to drink today, and you will. "
21," Asking Mesa directly is probably a good idea, they will have the best and most accurate info. They make their own tubes (or at least brand their own tubes) so they will probably recommend those. I personally have had bad luck with their stuff (preamp tubes at least). "
22," Came here to say this. I hate good mixes ruined by a super wide drum fill. I feel like Im pretty conservative with for a lot of people, though. "
23," Day 1 is the hardest day. I personally think day 1 is 50% of the work, days 2-5 40%, and the rest spread out here and there for the first three months. The anxiety you are feeling about making this choice can go away- if you really do this at some point (sooner than you might think) you will realize shit, I didnt think about drinking/not drinking today and you will *know* you can do this. "
24," Day 1 is the hardest day. I personally think day 1 is 50% of the work, days 2-5 40%, and the rest spread out here and there for the first three months. The anxiety you are feeling about making this choice can go away- if you really do this at some point (sooner than you might think) you will realize shit, I didnt think about drinking/not drinking today and you will *know* you can do this. "
25," Later down the line you are going to have a similar feeling that will feel alien, sneak up on you in the middle of the day for no reason. Its your brain thanking you for ceasing the punishment. Its fuckin weird but awesome as there are no side effects. "
26," Hell yeah. You did it. Thats all you have to do, make it to bed without a drink. Thats how I thought about it for the first few months- no matter what happens today, no matter what I might miss out on, I need to make it to bed with 0 drinks. That made for some early bedtimes, but it was the only way for me to do it and Im glad I did. I really did not miss out on much and waking up early started to be fun. I dont have to tell myself this now, as I all of a sudden didnt need to one day and I turned into a sober version of myself- like riding a bicycle. 

Today- the only thing I am going to do is not drink. Anything else comes second. Enjoy your second day sober. Before you realize it will be the second hundredth day. "
27, What does this have to do with racism? 
28, Most powerful Jedi who will ever live. When will people finally realize that? 
29," Yeah, thats the time the Facebook community bands together and liberates some from this dickhole. "
30, Here to double the use of micro shift. Goes on every vocal Ive ever done since I got it. 
31, Raise taxes then for Gods sake. And portraying city fund allocation as robbing belies your anti-worker political agenda. 
32," When theirs go up, ours go down? What the hell are you talking about? "
33," Well, we dont know the whole story. But, no bus driver in their right mind would let fighters back onto their bus. "
34, Thank you. This is such a fascinating case! It will be hard for me to imagine alcohol not being served at an event like this in Scotland of all places but I will assign it to my American ignorance. 
35," If he took all these women home from the same bar, wouldnt the people who work at the bar and even the other bar regulars recognize him and have more info on him? Its very strange to be a regular at a bar when you dont drink. "
36, /r/unexpectedCK2 
37," 	did none of these people ever hear the term post-modernist before 2015


Yes. They dont read books or engage with the arts. One of the Es in NEET stands for *education.* "
38, Holy fuck no wonder this country is so fucked up. That is absolutely insane. 
39," It was also shot with the same cameras, lighting, film stock, and processing. "
40," Costed? Also, whats reweaving? "
41, Im sincerely asking about the gif with Konnan and shit. 
42, No they arent (aw what I did there) 
43," I see. So, standard British English? What makes it better than any other kind? "
44," Whats proper English, the kind you use? "
45, I know what happened in Jan 4 1999. Im talking about the gift. It has Scott Steiner buff bagwell and shit 
46, Well then thats not what Im asking about 
47, Nah I meant the gif I know wat the finger poke of doom is 
48, What is it about that specific match in the gif? Just that its not a good match. 
49, What is it about that moment? Ive seen this gif before but I dont get the joke 
50," He could stand to have more to say, but with a personality like Jc its best for the co-host to be a little yes-manny to make things flow right. "
51, Careful saying that in this subreddit... 
52, Im sure there is some dealer of less-than-legal muggle artifacts hanging around the various haunts of the UK and it wouldnt take Moody very long to find this person and strike a deal. 
53, You can email fender consumer relations directly about it. Ive done it 3 or 4 times now. 
54," You are on the cusp. Also, all of this is 100% arbitrary. "
55, As was Harry Potter. 
56," Enjoyed it. I would give the option to blanket never answers for a section. Also, unless you are trying to deliberately influence answers, have any agree/disagree statements simple and lacking any sort of negation. Its hard to figure out if you agree or disagree with not doing something. "
57, Divination is NEWT level? 
58," This was the one hurdle that made it impossible for me to quit up until I finally did. Here is what I recommend-

Go ahead and drink as much coffee or whatever as you want. Just stay hydrated. I would drink about 2 pots of coffee a day, well into the night. Im talking like 9, 10 PM. I had no problem falling asleep, as Im sure youve found. 

Remind yourself that every day the most important thing you need to do is go to bed having not smoked. If that means going to bed early, so be it. You will only be missing out on things for a few months. Compared to the rest of your life thats nothing. 

I got put on zyban/Wellbutrin and one of he things that drug does is stimulate you a little bit. I now take a small stimulant in the afternoon as well. Dont be afraid to tell your doctor that you have this problem; since you are experiencing it for a good reason I would think they would want to help you by offering a treatment. 

The good news is that this should pass or get much less intense after a couple months or so. Keep in mind the most important thing for you to do every day is not smoke. "
59, Are there any capital ships from 50 bby-50aby ish that could be commandeered like this? 
60, It could t have been anything else 
61, *high-fives u* 
62, Null and void 
63, Might be easiest to have a skeleton crew lift one out of space dock or storage somewhere. Whats the minimum compliment for an *Imperial*-class SD? Is it possible to run as one man from the bridge like on the 23rd and 24th century Star Trek capital ships? 
64, They got a man wrestling a woman for Gods sake... all bets are off. 
65," You probably have moments like I dont feel any better, why am I doing this? These eventually stop too. I didnt know how much better I was actually feeling until later. Thats why Id say 80% around this point. You might be taking longer than me for many different reasons. The good will sneak up on you, that I can guarantee. Before you know it, you will have morphed into this new thing. It will still feel new and weird and alien but you will know youre there or something close. Kinda like building muscles. One day you notice them and they are weird. If I had to do it over again, with zero hesitation I would choose sobriety. Today we both make that choice and its the right one to make today. "
66," 90 in was a seriously good point for me- when I actually started to feel *good*. It was the point where I stopped thinking about it all the time, stopped counting the days. I crested the hill of feeling normal. I feel today about 80% the same I did around 90. This isnt true for everyone so if you havent started feeling these things dont worry about it, but I suspect you will be reaching these feelings soon. "
67, You are arguing in bad faith. 
68, You know your school probably has a counselor that can help you deal with your feelings and behave a little more maturely. 
69, Doesnt look like a teenager 
70, A 25 year old cant play a 15 year old. The marauder generation needed to come off as parental and 40s is more believe-able than 20s. 
71," Thats exactly what I said- 40 can play 30,  but even 25 cant play 15 (unless youre the woman who played moaning myrtle). "
72, Except for maybe a guy with his hands in his pockets for the entire match. 
73, Because it doesnt break the illusion. 
74, They never had to work to support themselves and were raised by maids. 
75, What about a more detailed retelling as episodic TV show? I would love to watch every chapter of the books. 
76, The difference between 20 and 30 or 30 and 40 is a lot different than 20 and 15. 
77, That is quite different and you know it. 
78, One of the music man amps from the late 70s. Theyre not terribly heavy and sound good for what you are asking for. 
79, Its chill I knew you didnt have an explanation and were just a racist. 
80," But why does it matter if Superman, Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, or Jesus is Asian? You only think of them as white because that is how they are portrayed and its what youre used to. It doesnt disrespect their characters any unless you think being Asian is less than respectable that being white. "
81, Oof 
82, Why does it matter to you what race a fictional character is? 
83," So because he seemed genuine on Joe Rohan, hes not responsible for all of these clearly awful things? "
84, Whats up with the vt stuff?  Never met a traynor I didnt like (though a lot of them are not loud enough to be bass amps). 
85," *Enmpire* and *Clones* use those two colors, albeit differently. The beginning of ESB and Ep II is blue and they both end orange. "
86," 	1. Blood purity type deal going on with this guy?

*Toujours Pur* Sirius, **Toujours Pur** "
87," Its good he dumped you. That means youve exited a relationship that wasnt working. You probably felt like this when you quit, too. You were leaving a bad relationship then, too! Some profoundly good things for us hurt a lot. Be happy you are no longer in those relationships that were holding you back! "
88, I mean well duh. Did you know Fox News has a right wing bias? 
89, Thanks. I personally skip 2x12 combos and would rather have a 2x12 or 4x12 closed back cab if a deluxe or similar isn't right. Like all ss amps trying to sound like a tube amp (modeling or not) the OD sounds are easier to nail it seems. Congrats on your new amp. 
90," Thanks for the tip! I've got one for you: sometimes people say something that they don't mean literally. There's metaphoric speech, hyperbole, sarcasm, irony... the list goes on! "
91, I found them an eyesore personally. I hated waking around my neighborhood tripping over them. Better than just regular trash I suppose. 
92, Worst soundcheck ever 
93, Or control his attacker's mind and turn the gun on themself. 
94, wtf hitbox? HAX 
95,"  Nobody ever casts a bunch of buffs and shields before battle

The battle of Hogwarts. Flitwick et al are casting all kinds of protective spells. In the movie it's a pretty big scene. "
96," Garza off the top at 1:19 DAMN. This video starts sloppy but gets good. I feel like their pace is a little too fast for things to be really clicking all the time. Personally, I think the slower the pace the better, even in Lucha. Some of Psi and Rey's best matches are very slow for being Lucha matches. "
97," Notice any differences from a regular tube amp? Also, why did you decide to get a twin vs a deluxe or princeton if volume is a consideration? I personally think a (regular) twin is only suitable for three types of players these days. Thanks for the trip report I've been very curious about these. "
98, Isn't he dead by el camino? 
99, Who's the patron saint of Alberta then? St. William? 
100," It's fucking stupid. If someone can lie unchecked, what's the point of the debate? "
101, Yes but who associates snakes with Ireland? 
102, Who would spend $10 on this... at *any* point in history? 
103, What the hell is this website 
104, I guess that makes Kreature uncle Tom. 
105, I think you are overthinking it. Ireland doesn't even have snakes. 
106,  
107," Totally necessary. Hedwig is fine when you're at school every day, but when you're on the run hunting down bits of junk an animal is not something you want to look after. "
108," Horseshit. If you are moderating something like that it is your duty as a journalist and/or public presenter to keep fucking lies from influencing the public. Disgusting anyone would think otherwise, it just hurts our country. "
109, If they got rid of the pocket guy I would consider watching. 
110," What a joke. ""It's not my job to fact-check statements, it's the opposition's job"" bitch that is your ONLY job. "
111, Chris Wallace has sucked for years now. It's crazy to me that anyone thinks he has credibility. 
112, This is a thing that predates the internet. There's even a name for them- grocer's apostrophe. 
113," Soundtoys Devil Loc. Sometimes I'll use dbx 160 too but I usually like to put that on the snare and i don't like using the same ""character"" compressors on an input if I can help it. "
114," Megabus: ""It's always something"" "
115," Man we are of the same cloth then. I've studied both Latin and Ancient Greek, but I find people who opine over the ""correct"" endings to words like this are just trying to show everyone how smart they are. "
116," Thanks for sharing your perspective with me, really. If asshole isn't the right word, is the right word ""inconsiderate""? "
117," Sure, but it does lend a racist element to your discussion, intentional or not. "
118," People don't make this ""mistake"" they know they are being fucking assholes and just don't care. Tell me that you would do this ""on accident."" "
119," Why wouldn't he put his leg where it belongs like everyone else on that airplane, unless his balls just WANT that delicious coffee. "
120, Yes he does. People like this are assholes 24/7 and don't care. 
121," That, or they could read a fucking book once in a while. "
122," How about ""Jesuses"" because we're speaking English and not Latin or ancient Greek. "

129," aquaphonr lip care- not the regular aquaphor, but the special little lip one. Ive had to do this twice now as an adult and i loved those things. They were the best working by far. Also drink water. "
130, This froze up on me 73% of he way in. Safari on an iPhone 6. 
131, Im so glad to hear you say this. I try and sell everyone on it all the time- were not number one in any one category but when you average it all out we beat pretty much anywhere thats 1 mil and up (maybe tied with Toronto). 
132, Good job. You should try bangs some time. 
133, Do you have straight hair? 
134," A+

~~Exceeds Expectations~~ Outstanding "
135, I propose this is worked into the subreddit header or style sheet 
136," Cool. I would never own one of these guys but I sell them and they are a favorite of mine to sell. Every inch of them is so... *right*. Clearly designed and kept current by an actual player. Their qc is light years beyond anyone else, and there is a certain art to them that Gibsons, Fenders, and the rest just dont have. Totally not my bag, but I think they are so cool and for players who do like them, there couldnt be anything more ideal. "

139, I need to meet the person who made this tweet 
140, Its the debut episode though.  You cant really tell until you have more data. 
141," You look like a totally different person compared to before. Did you do your makeup different too? You look cooler and younger, so I hope those are things you like people to think about you. When it comes in more there are going to be a lot of fun things you can do with it- us curly haired folks have way more options when it comes to short hair so I hope you keep it short for a while and experiment.

142, Called that shit. Ten years.

148, I'd be down with a more oldschool approach of an A show and B show. Like A Raw on Mondays and an NXT-like Smackdown on Friday or something. The thing is they are too big and have way too much talent right now- too many people would get left out.

174, How come I didn't know this existed. 
175," To piggyback here- I have actually curly hair, so take my advice with that in mind, but it is the thickest that any barber or hairdresser I've ever seen has cut, if they are all to be believed. What I would do is turn the shower off, and apply the conditioner starting from front to back, running my hands through my hair. Rub it up in your hands like you were going to make a lather so its all over your hands. I'll let it sit for a minute or two, then rinse it out by bending over forward like a bow and doing the same motion with my hands through my hair, but bringing them away from my head at the end of the hairs, all the while the shower is spraying water on it. Don't need to do this too much, you want some of the conditioner to stay in. Then the other things I would say are the most important-

Pat dry and try and let it air dry as much as possible. Don't do any other drying method unless you know what you are doing or experimenting. 

I wash my hair every 2-3 days, and even then maybe will only put product in it once or twice a week. Depending on what you have and what you want, less is often more I find. "
176, It's 90% of it for sure. 
177, He's just saying what we *used* to do with spies. 
178," I recently discovered deva curl one condition, it has turned me back in to conditioner. Previously I have used Kevin Murphy easy rider but thats more because I have truly curly hair and I wasnt looking for this particular look. If youre wavy I do recommend the Kevin Murphy Killer Waves. All the KM stuff is super legit but of course it is expensive. "
179," There's probably not a better mic do make this ""mistake"" with. "
180," Hello,

If you have thick hair, using a modest amount of nice conditioner can work. It can't be too curly or too thin. Also, it will rarely *stay* like this- these are modeling shots after all. "
181, Now we're talking. Are there instruments that can even measure workrate levels that high?

184, God damn it fuck you I did not need to be surprised by this today.

186, Orlando. Rent at least more expensive than Chicago is now. Tampa is probably more affordable. All I know about Clearwater is that's where the Scientologists are. The St Pete/Tampa area can be nice. 
187," Yeah, you can plane the fingerboard. Other than high action, super thick necks are the most disappointing aspect of student violins. "
188, No fuckin way! Purchaser probably didnt know what the fuck and just said the hell with it and ordered loads of 58s 
189," If you dont have a more appropriate mic for drum overheads, then the venue is likely too small to necessitate an overhead mic. "
190, Where's the pictures of those? 
191,"  some feeling of value for that

What are you missing? Where with lower taxes/rent are you thinking you will get anything even close? You and I likely have different values when it comes to... value... "
192," I guess you and I are part of a small demographic, because this is the most ideal place for me to live in the country. Ten years ago, my home state of Florida was one of the cheapest to live in. Now it is one of the most expensive. I pay less in rent than people in my hometown do now and I get reliable public transportation, bicycle-friendly streets, and some semblance of arts and culture. Philadelphia is still cheaper and I like it plenty but it's a hole and it's dangerous. "
193," Did you move the audio files to a different place on your computer/hard drive? Pro Tools has a hard time finding audio files sometimes, even if you barely do anything to move them. "
194, It's not as big a deal as you might think. It's very hard to break anything. 
195," You're not going to damage it no matter what you do. The only thing could be string tension so tight that you can't pull the neck down flat.

You will want some sort of setup change each time you change tunings or string gauges. A lot of the time the difference is negligible. For me it is usually string heights because I like mine super low these days.

And for what it's worth- 60 is probably too big. 56 I find is more than big enough all the way down to C. Anything lower than that 60 might be called for but I found the string to be too cumbersome (have to file the nut a lot, can't be very low on fretboard). I recommend DDR DDT which are designed for lower tunings and for changing around tunings. I have yet to meet a string I like more and I've played on nothing else unless they were out of stock for 7+ years. Bass strings are supposedly garbage though.

OH! And a set with a wound G is probably a good idea as well. "
196, I love it. One moment shes Katherine Hepburn we have no weapons... then shes Mae West Arent you a little short for a stormtrooper? 
197, I would say drums are a necessary condition for rock. 
198, 11-54 or 11-60 or something in between. Youre going to be tuning down more than up. Tunings that are only 2 pitch classes are going to need their own special gauges though. 
199, I think this looks cool. Way to go! 
200," If any character was going to get to say it, it was him. "
201," Not really. The clean is very ""fender-y"" and not like the JC series. The drive channel is weird and doesn't sound great, but it has this weird compressor thing on it which was interesting. One of the best sounding solid state amps for sure. "
202, I had the red knob version of this. I liked it quite a bit. 
203," I have a bag for a Peavey Mini Max that I've been using but the knobs keep getting somehow bent or pushed in and I have to carefully push them back out. I know at least one pot or the shaft has come unseated or slightly skewed and it sucks. What I'm going to do is make what is essentially a stuffed animal type thing the size of the faceplate, and put it face down in the mini max bag. 

Darkglass also sell a bag. I think it is a bit too large for my tastes. Quilter make way better bags and include them with their amps. I also put it in my gig bag a lot but you can't really fit anything else in there once it's in there. At a bare minimum I'd want two instrument cables and the one button footswitch.

204," Cool. Does it have any drive to it at all? I imagine the Blues Jr used to be a bit overdriven when you ran into it. How usable is the EQ? Have you used it with different cabs? I bet it might not be powerful enough for a 4x12, especially at 16 ohms. Speaking of which, have you played around with impedance? I haven't noticed a big difference with my solid state amps but they are all big and loud. I'm into the idea of a pedalboard amp, but I they are mostly underpowered for my current purposes. Oh, and does the headphone or line out have a cabinet sim/impulse response? My quilter does not and I find it makes these outputs rather unusable. "

So in A Matter of Honor the Klingons have been speaking this ""basic"" language to each other and Riker since they are allies and have signed an agreement to use this language around Federation types to support this alliance. But later on the Klingon ship they lapse back into their real language and then are surprised when they find out Riker can speak it. This type of thing (speaking ""basic"" then using Klingon/native language in the same scene) happens a lot in ST like you say; I'm willing to bet my explanation can cover those instances. "

It's 2019 and we have needed a real edrum set for about twenty years. I know for a fact there would be a market for standalone electronic snare with its own module if you could get all of that nuance out of it and tweak it.

I stand behind saying this amplifier will sound cleaner with 6550 or KT88 (if it will fit). The people all the time want to switch out the 6550s that came with US Marshall amps to EL34 bceause they break up differently. "

Yes. I'm 15 years younger than him and I don't look as nearly as good.

I don't mean to be condescending, but this is all a work you know. Dude has a lot of money but he's still small time compared to anyone in pro sports, an actor, or celebrity chef even. And thanks to his podcast and tons of interviews and books, we know that this is a pretty normal guy who is into pretty regular shit. Even in kayfabe dude is very far from Flair, Ted DiBiase, or even like MJF trying to sell us on how they ball. I have to say again, those restaurants are fancy to me, but the joint I legitimately try to hit up every time I'm in Tallahassee is Whataburger so I might be skewed a little low.

The other things you mention are pretty easy to explain. Top pros that have been around for a while often rent private planes (fucking Brock owns one) because it is cheaper than flying commercial, and when you fly as much as they do going in a 737 everywhere with 100 ""friends"" gets on really quick. Same with the airport VIP room. It's not terrifically expensive for them and when you travel almost all year round and shit like this takes a serious edge off. I live a somewhat similar lifestyle (travel-wise, not paycheck wise) and I'll tell you the things that I miss the absolute most are four fucking walls around me with a closed door to myself for even one god damn hour and a halfway decent cup of coffee that I will want to drink all of. So it's easy for me to turn that into a quiet place to de-plane from a private jet and the steak that is the same no matter what part of the country I am in.

On the real though- this whole situation is funny and the Longhorn steakhouse part of it certainly adds greatly to the humor. "
280," I doubt anyone recognized him or realize he came from a black car. When you're on the road for a long time, sometimes you want to go somewhere that you know what you're gonna get. Those other restaurants also seem like they would take a lot of time compared to Longhorn. Also, he might be on some weird diet (he is a 47 year old athlete after all) where he knows that there is a dish at Longhorn he can order that will be a good fit for it. Plus, I don't like eating fancy people food and if I were a millionaire I still wouldn't. "

This next time is a longer journey so I am going to try gate checking it which is what the guitar player in my band did on the previous journey. Its free and a porter puts it under the plane right where you can see him do it, and they give it to you as you leave the gate. These flights will be international so Im not sure how it will go but Im bringing a beater so losses will be minimal. Worst case I will have to ditch it and buy one in the country Im flying to. 

People here are gonna tell you to check your bass, but it will be considered oversize and cost $200 extra each way. So think about that before you buy a $150 flight case. "

It means both of those things. All totalitarian states are one party states.

 turning america into a one party state wouldn't make it fascist

What would it be then? It would no longer be a democracy, wouldn't it? And as for defining fascism, [this wikipedia page](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Definitions_of_fascism) does a pretty comprehensive job. A lot of people point to the Umberto Eco list as a good basic reference. Mussolini is not the be-all, end-all authority on what fascism is.

Still not anywhere close to fascism.

*""Disagreement Is Treason""  Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action, as well as out of fear that such analysis will expose the contradictions embodied in a syncretistic faith.*

*""Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy"" because ""Life is Permanent Warfare""  there must always be an enemy to fight. Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to NOT build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.*

While not fascist in and of itself, casting your political enemies in the same light as those that are more universally considered a national threat is a fascist tactic. You don't see American democrats doing the same to their enemies.

hitler is similar to republicans because hitler ate food and drank water, just like republicans! Every political faction in history has sought to otherwise their domestic political rivals.

With this I get now that you are arguing in bad faith. Calling your political enemies traitors and in league with true existential threats to the nation (terrorist fist-jab, anyone?) is a classic tactic among fascists and totalitarians. If you can show my anyone in a liberal democracy doing something like this I will yield the point. They must be actual political leaders, not some yahoo on the internet or a fringe member of the political movement. "
328," The first sentence in this article reads

I've lived in the US for my entire life and I'm honestly not sure if I've ever even seen an American centered map in real life before. As far as I can tell, it basically only exists on the internet for people to rightfully mock.

I was in a US public school from 1990-2003, and I saw many cold war era holdovers in our materials, but never something like this. Now, there is a person responding to that article who attended *private* schools that says she saw this, but does not see it in the public school she now works in. 

I'm not saying that this kind of map doesn't exist, but I have seen zero evidence of it being used in a US public school, much less it having widespread use among American schools. Did all the schools just ""switch back"" recently? Up through my senior year of high school we were still playing around with maps that had the Soviet Union, Zaire, east and west Pakistan, etc. I find it hard to beleive this would come and go so quickly, given how expensive classroom materials are.

359, It has everything to dow with the key- it is now in D major. 
360," Are you saying that if you played a pitch that was C5 in A=440 equal temperament, I (or someone with good pitch memory or whatever) would be able to identify it as such? Because I agree with that. I've had to do that as part of an exam before.

Here is a hopefully more clear statement of my argument, or maybe I am replying to two different people and I am too stupid to figure out who I am talking to.

1. Every note in the equal tempered system we use today is the same distance from the one above it and below it- one semitone.
2. The distance between any A and the C right above it is two and a half steps- 150 cents- no matter what octave.
3. The distance between any C and Eis then also two and a half steps, 150 cents
4. This follows for all modes and indeed any set in ET.
5. Therefore the ratio of frequencies between the A and the C and the C and the Eare the same.
6. No matter what key you are in the harmony comes out the same way- same ratios between pitches relative to a key (and indeed all keys).

Now let's compare this to a different tuning system like a just intonation system.

1. The notes in this system are not the same distance apart. A home key or starting point is picked (let's call it C) and the other pitches are described by adding pure fifths to the starting C.
2. The farther you get from the home key, the more out of tune things are going to get (by which I mean the ratio in Hz between two given notes of the same interval in different classes). Especially when compared to the ""perfect"" sounding starting key.
3. The distance between an A an a C in octave 4 are different than the A and the C in octave 5 (if you let the octave drift).
4. The distance between any C and E is different from any of the the A and Cs and also different from the other Cs and Es in different octaves.
5. All modes and all scales in a given key for this temperament are compose of sets that have different distances between the pitches.
6. These differences between keys give them a quality, like a major or minor chord. The C major home key is full of nice small ratios while a key like C# does not have many pure intervals.

If I have perfect pitch, I can tell you that a recording is playing back at the wrong pitch or speed or something. Yes different frequencies literally sound different from one another. I could prove to you that keys are indistinguishable by recording a piece on piano in the key of C then recording in in C# and pitch shifting it down to C. Unless the recording is of very high quality and you know what to listen for, I bet you couldn't pick one over the other correctly more than half the time. "

364,"  if we were to take the visual spectrum of color, and move all our color names one to the left, such that violet wrapped around to refer to red, red is yellow, yellow is green, etc. If we go through all our paintings and swap those colors accordingly, nothing will change right?

I reject your comparison. If we went through all our music and shifted it up a half step, there is nothing inherently different about it other than that it is in a different key. The only differences lie in perception at the lower and and higher end of the freq spectrum. It can't be too low otherwise we can't discern the harmony, same for it being too high. The name assignments are arbitrary, other than all classes are multiples. In strict ET their relationship to other named pitches are the same. *That* is what *I'm* saying. You can't make the well tempered clavier out of this because in that temperament the relationships of the pitches to their given tonic is different for every key. That is where the OP is nonsense. They can play pretend all they want about it and that's fine but it is not reality. I read my horoscope but I know it is bullshit. 

your scale will sound different depending on your starting point because of your ability to perceive absolute frequency 

Sure, but the only thing that is different is the fact that it started somewhere different than whatever we are comparing it to. Without that context there is nothing inherent about one starting point or another. Within an octave, it is truly meaningless. I hope you can see that.

If I pitch shifted Beethoven's Choral symphony up or down one step, none of these key centers has any impression or inherent quality that makes it different from the other. "
365," I have to downvote/block anything pewdiepie just on principle at this point, but thanks "
366," You recall D because you've heard and played it tons of times and called that. It really is that simple. Someone from India, southeast Asia, Georgia, Malawi, or Renaissance Europe might not have had the same musical upbringing, so they may think of pitch relationships differently than you do. There is no essential quality to the D other than the frequency it vibrates at. In the time of Bach he would have not thought of it as a D when he heard it, because pitch definitions varied from town to town. If you sang a note that was the same as a D on his organ, he might recognize it that way but there was no ""D""-ness to it that made him think that.

Higher is usually always brighter to people. It's one of the reason we tune to A 440- orchestras kept tuning higher and higher to get a brighter sound. Some orchestras tune higher than 440. My college tuned all its pianos to 441. This frustrated me to no end. All you are doing is making everyone have to re-tune for the sake of this ""brightness."" A measly four cents. It only sounds brighter because it is sharper than everything else! It is kind of like the loudness war in audio mastering. It is certainly a singer or pianist who is thinking to tune them like this, not someone who has a nice old instrument that has been played in tune for decades and does not like small adjustments to make it out of tune at the whims of a power-drunk piano tuner or assistant department head.

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what we're talking about. I'll put it another way- if we wrote, read, and spoke english, but every letter was pushed down one in the alphabet, that is to say instead of typing an A we would type B, instead of B we would type C, etc. back round to instead of Z we type A, the words in our language would not lose their meaning or essential nature. It's the same with pitch classes in equal temperament. The relationship between each pitch class is the same, so all function is the same.

When I say an orchestra is using equal temperament, I mean the tonic for each key is the one defined by the A 440 system. We may vary the related pitches in whatever harmony/mode we are using (higher leading tones, your just thirds, etc) but those home pitches are from ET. In something like meantone or Pythagorean temperaments the key of C and key of F# are wildly different sounding, because the intervals themselves within the keys are different. Your high leading tone in C major is now way way too high for the fourth scale degree of F# major. But in ET, we can adjust based on what we have defined as tonic. That B can slide back down to perfect compared to the F# we are using, and our E# can come up when we are using it as a leading tone. These alterations are done *to taste* are all based on the ET system as a reference.

On your guitar, what would you consider the ""proper"" major third to be? I bet it changes depending on what chord you are playing or what key you are in. Playing an open E chord you probably want it higher, an open G chord you probably want it lower (a Pythagorean 4th and nice wide 6th respectively). I tune the G and D strings of my violin a little sharp and the E string a little flat so I have pure fifths all the way around. However, I usually can't get my G up high enough to where it sounds right  to me in an ensemble because I will need the open G to be in tune with others and it's the only pitch I can't play stopped. Thus, any double stops of a fifth between the G and that D are a little skewed, while between the other strings it's straight across.

I hope this makes a little more sense. i don't think you are quite understanding what my criticism is. Basically, it boils down to all keys having identical relationships between their tonic and the other pitches in their set when using ET. Everyone uses a form of ET except for ensembles including period keyboard and fretted instruments. "

371," Yeah it's a shame because there is *some* validity to this depending on your instrument. What's more interesting to me is how certain ensembles (like choir or string quartet) tune individual harmonies within one piece of music. Musicians of some skill will do this unknowingly a lot of the time, and truly great masters can decide just how they are going to tune each pitch. Then you can get into what keys sound better in what rooms and all that. But this horoscope stuff is just as cool I guess *shrug emoji* "

375," It makes it kinda useless. If pitch shifted a recordig in C major up a whole step would it still have the same innate ""pure, innocent joy?"" of course not. "
376,"  How do we distinguish pitch classes in the mind

Years and years of listening and playing in pitch collections associated with our culture. I knew what a ""D"" was when i was 8 years old, but an 8 year old Hmong child might not have the proper context for something like that.

Edit: What instrument(s) do you play?

Why did Shostakovich want to write a Prelude and Fugue for each of the 24 major and minor keys? Just shits and giggles? 

Pretty much.

Equal temp works in orchestra on almost every note. Any time you do a key change from C to C# you are going to use the equal tempered pitches. I do understand what you and the OP are saying, and I have had feelings like that before, but by and large since the non-equal tuning systems you and I use are mutable and still defined by equal temp, they are essentially invalid.

382," My taxes also went down slightly. Not enough to make any real difference but this did happen and the process was simplified too. However, taxes did go up for a lot of people, especially people in the small business owner income range. I have friends who are contractors who have complained of a noticeable increase. Why couldnt they just not lower the taxes on the wealthiest 1% the littlest tiniest bit to offset this tax increase for those at a this moderate income level? I cant think of one good reason other than they serve the interests of those wealthy 1%. 

If your healthcare premiums or costs have gone down you are in the extreme minority in this country. For most of us, the costs are obscenely unaffordable, and they really shouldnt be for citizens of the wealthiest country in recorded history, especially when the people who live comparable nations never have this worry. I dont know who you get your insurance from but I have never heard of increasing coverage for anyone in the past five years, let alone increasing coverage at a lower premium. Be thankful for the unicorn that your insurance policy is. 

As a business owner, you have a different economic arena than us wage earners. Real wages have been flat in this country since before I was born. My parents were professionals with masters degrees and other accreditations and they still didnt pop 100k combined when they retired less than ten years ago. They were able to afford those degrees and a house in the 70s and 80s, but most people can no longer afford an education like this and remain wage earners rather than become professionals. The economy might look good right  to you or an analyst but for those of us making less than 100k a year things are very far from the way they used to be 20 years ago. For those of us under 50k we pretty much have to have two jobs in order to save money or pay on any kind of debt.

389," Some would sound not good probably. A proper bass fuzz would have some kind of dry blend or dry output. A lot of the time, they'll try and take the DI before your pedals if they can. A lot of people have a DI on their pedalboards, right after their tuner output. I personally try to take things post eq and forgo using a mic at all. A lot of ""heavy"" bands prefer a mic but if they have a head with a decent sounding line out I'll use that and a DI box right before the input and they can pretend the foh mix is getting that sweet mic'd cab sound and never know otherwise. For most of the music I mix, the DI sound is only there to reinforce sub frequencies and/or presence, and the overall sound is very dependent on amp tone. "
390," A lot of people are going to want to get the pre sound over the post sound (behind the amp before the cab would be post) because they will hear the post sound out of the rig you've got, and the pre sound will be (supposedly) easier to work with. "

Natives could be Klingons or Kazon... I think I would pick Kazon because they come off a little less one-dimensional than Klingons do. Bullock would *totally* be a Vulcan. Same with Sol probably. Maybe Sol's an android. All I can think of for Alma is Betazoid, it's probably the hair. Jane always struck me as having a sort of Odo-like role in the camp, but from another extreme.

I don't think you're going to find many democrats who are against a border fence. However, a big scary wall is a waste of money, not very effective, and will take decades to complete. Why not nationalize our healthcare system instead with that money? It will take way less time.

Entering the country illegally or overstaying a visa used to not be a crime up until very very recently It was a civil offence and had a civil penalty (deportation and banishment for a period of time).

Janeway's thing is that she earnestly tries to make something out of nothing and gives a lot of second chances. The others do this on occasion as well, but those traits are pretty strongly hers. Her treatment of Neelix is a good example of these two things. I also like that once you cross the line with her, expect nothing but wrath.

728," I always felt bad for him when you learn his backstory in half blood prince. I thought that's what Jo was trying to do with that book- subvert our assumptions about some of the key characters (Tom, Snape, Dumbledore, maybe Harry) and that things like good and evil are more a ""point of view"" to quote another legendary dark wizard. Any sympathy generated for Tom Riddle in that book eventually turned into pity for me, and I assume that's what the King's Cross scene in DH is supposed to engender. "
729," How is it ""butchered""? "
730," I've seen it quite recently. Nothing of the sort happens. He projects dominance because he knows he is one of the only things Tom fears. It's quite a good scene, but this is par for the course for /r/harrypotter where people just can not shit on the movies enough. "
731," It's a movie. How long should it be? The movie is already 2 1/2 hours long. I would have loved to see the statues move. I remember thinking that was going to happen when you first see them, but by the time this part was over I didn't really miss it. "

Where are they coming undone? Has this happened for the entire past 18 years? 

Most importantly I would say to wipe them down every time you are done playing, and I'm talking bone dry- get up under them with a microfiber or something. There are also cleaners- spray some on there and ensure any dirt is getting removed and will keep corrosion from starting.

Second most important is to keep your axe closed in its case, every second it isn't being played. In my experience what ruins strings is oxidation and not so much dirt or physical wear.

~~Lastly, I would recommend getting more expensive strings, especially any kind that purport to last longer or be made by master German craftsmen or something like that. Cheap strings fall apart. And by ""more expensive"" I mean maybe spend like $50 for a set. Dominant is what almost everyone used in my childhood and adolescence. They are expensive these days but people considered them a good value because they would put up with sweaty kids sawing on them all the time.~~ I don't know if there is a specific material that is more hardy, but if the actual wind is coming undone I would say is probably poor manufacturing and not the wind material itself. **Sorry, I assumed you were a more novice player and I didn't see you've been playing for 18 years**.

754, Do you just like fucking with me or what 
755, lol no way ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha 
756, If you are inappropriate like this and scream at people over nothing you deserve people clowning on you. Hope this guy learns his lesson. 
757, What did he even grab? A backpack with a cinder block in it? 
758, This shit is supposed to be a hobby. To be fun. To make you feel good. As soon as I started using tools that were worth even half of a fuck I was suddenly competent at these tasks. What a miracle. Fuck that myth busters twat AND his shitty tools. More horsehockey aphorisms that are as divorced from reality as *Knights of the Old Republic* or some shit. 
759, Sick choice Mischa is tha bomb 
760," Well, it's considered the best by *me*...

I've actually never heard the Kachaturian. He's a favorite of mine I have to check that out now. Thanks! "
761," Yes, what is better? "
762, Sibelius 
763," My violin teacher summed up why hes not the absolute greatest in three words- bad inner parts. I could not agree more. However, he wrote the second best violin concerto ever so I cant hate too much. "
764, I dont like being called a bad workman  
765, But what if you have shitty tools that dont work? What if I asked you to build a cabinet with nothing but a dull-ass sawblade and a stubby flathead screwdriver? Would that make you a bad workman? This is a bullshit saying. 
766, My $15 soldering iron is great too. But I did the Adam Savage rule on those and went through four before I got one that was worth a shit. That rule is fine for hammers but not for stuff that plugs into the wall or blades. 
767," This isn't stereo, is it? "
768," This is fair, but a lot of cheap tools are shitty and can hold you back. This also goes for *inappropriate* tools as well. I personally am finished working 10x harder than I need to pursue my hobbies which are supposed to be for personal enjoyment and not piss me off. "
769, Praise the camera man for being in the right place for them to fake that punch. 
770," You can not do much with an $8 soldering iron, I don't care who you are. "
771, Please tell me this is from the Onion or something. 
772, It really does not seem like a computer wrote these... 
773, This is such bullshit advice. Working with shitty tools sucks and makes you want to quit. You feel like you are unable to do these things that others find so easy. You feel worthless. If had decent tools from the start I would be way farther along in electronics and woodworking. 
774, What are the details of how this was made? 
775," I guess that is everyone who is 24+? I didn't see ""Gen Z"" until it was all over with "
776, Is that a darkglass cab? 
777, That makes much more sense. 
778," What I meant was does it sound good at a loud volume. I can already tell this thing is going to be loud as hell, even into 16 ohms. "
779,"  Livewire SPDI Passive Direct Box with Attenuation Pad

Sounds scary to me, still a massive impedance mismatch. A Quilter would probably live through it, but mine has an XLR output. "
780, Cool! Great combo there and it looks very pretty. 
781, Damn how much would you sell one for? 
782," Bupropion is no joke, thats the shit that finally worked for me. "
783, Love that amp. Nice knobs. 
784, What usb interface can you run a speaker load into? 
785," I JUST got an overdrive 200 and while plinking around with it at home at tiny volume and I heard the things he talks about in this video in the amp, cuz I watched this video yesterday in anticipation. Hoping it passes the big boy volume test. "
786, where are these all coming from? 
787," I don't think there is much benefit to taking those off, at least on a less expensive instrument. "
788, How come we haven't seen foo fighters since WW2? 
789," What is the ""T"" supposed to stand for in their sub title? "
790," Some may not like this, but turn the knobs until it sounds good. How much of your time do you sit there watching a band play? Fiddle around with a knob or two and see what it does to impact the mix. "
791," I personally would not recommend Mesa tubes. They cheap tubes, rebranded. Same goes for Groove Tubes. "
792, Oh no I don't doubt it or anything just $20 seems scary for something like that to be effective. Rock that shit! 
793, That eq curve sure is scary but the axes aren't even labeled. 
794," That picture's misleading. There is no normal US plug that is that huge.

[This more what I mean.](https://cdn.itead.cc/media/catalog/product/s/2/s20.jpg) See how the EU plug is this super huge circle? [This adapter also illustrates my point a bit better.](https://www.legrand.com/ecatalogue/media/catalog/product/cache/4/image/650x650/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/0/5/050385_pw_188111_pz.jpg) The european stuff is so needlessly huge. I understand the fuse in the UK one but it still seems like it shouldn't be so large. "
795," Common.

Knowledge. "
796," Tom! I love him so so much. I disagree about the fuse in each plug though, but it is a logistic thing that defines standards like this that will likely never change. "
797," It's an insane difference, look: https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91BT2waAVdL._SX425_.jpg

The mainland Europe ones are slightly smaller. "
798, Weird. I just bend 'em back. Anything serious to plug in has three prongs and is pretty robust. I just wonder how Euros (and others) plug in multiple things to power strips and the like. If you live in an old building it's often the case there is only one outlet in each room. 
799, This looks like an elaborate set for a production of *Les Misrables.* 
800, Man now I want to visit Georgia. How dangerous is the countryside to foreigners? 
801," ""Honorable mention"" at an X-files cosplay contest. "
802, Who does uber in a McLaren? 
803, Almost all US ones have three pins as well. Is there some epidemic of plugs getting pulled out? 
804, I look at all these foreign power plugs and they are so unnecessarily large. UK and Europe are especially silly looking. Why? 
805," Cool, it was recommended to me a lot, and I almost bought one. Most Duncans are far from one-trick and very adaptable. "
806, Fuc how heavy is it? 
807, Cool. Tell us about the full shred. 
808, I think you are misunderstanding my comments but i really dont wish to argue. 
809, Oh word. Yes I would try listening on instruments you don't usually hear. I personally like all his stuff best on harpsichord or organ but it's somewhat difficult to hunt that stuff down. 
810, Damn how loud's that pro? 
811, Sibelius. I think it's my favorite piece of music actually. 
812, It doesn't look right because it is a thing most people have not seen in real life. It's pretty clear that two jetliners crashed into those buildings in NYC. 
813, I love this label more than any other. Everything is so well curated and the recording/mixing/mastering of their stuff is so way beyond anyone else. 
814," I am a lot of things, but that isn't relevant to this. It's ridiculous to count out what it says on the inside just because. "
815, S A T I R E 
816, Like a full sized humbucker? 
817," Man, I want a CNC "
818, How do you shower? I'm gonna say no and try and work with what you've got. Rock your beard. Those of us with hair don't have those. 
819, So let's not bother with a decent photo then 
820," Listen to it on ""non-traditional"" instruments like classical guitar or synthesizer. Do you play? What do you play? I always say that every musician should play Bach, because you learn something about your own playing and about music itself. "
821," Gee, don't bother to read the writing on the inside of it or anything, or better yet post a picture of this writing so we can see what it says. "
822, Too bad only the worst music on the planet was ever broadcast through it (and Bob Dylan). 
823," Word. Well you should check out the darkglass amps for sure. I got the 900 watt microtubes one and it rips- I don't miss having a tube amp and distortion pedals at all. The clean channel will be perfect for jazz, it's very warm and sounds like your bass, kinda like an eden. the distortion channel is unbelievable. And I only use one ""flavor"" of the two distortion profiles it has. It will doom with the best of them (I play through a 2x15). There is a 500 watt version which might be more affordable, or you can probably score a version 1 of the 900 watt one for about the same price. It was the most money I ever spent on an amp but man did it cure the ""not loud enough"" problem and sounds as good or better than my traynor. "
824, Are you looking for a combo or a head? 
825, Crazy... how much do modern bow holds vary? 
826, It's probably cheaper to use gold leaf :-P 
827, Good night sweet prince 
828, Yeah damn that actually looks good 
829," Besides dimes, what other stuff do you guys use to shim? "
830, Maybe these people wouldnt shoot each other if they had jobs 
831," Nothing sexual? What exactly does ""dating"" mean to a 28 year old man? "
832," So cops need *more* money, schools and teachers need *less* of it. You really should run for office. "
833, Gee I wonder why people don't trust the police 
834, Maybe if they had access to jobs they wouldn't be breaking the law. 
835," Dont get me wrong, I love some mids, but tones that are more mids than not are hard to make work. "
836," Yeah, to be truthful a lot of the time I find a little spot to stick out, but for a lost of styles the bass is best when it is out of the way of the other instruments. "
837, The best bass tones are scooped. 
838, I never understood why Americans think like this. What's wrong with just being American? I have one grandparent who was born outside the US. That does not make me anything but an American. 
839, I did a master to Spotifys specs and it was too quiet compared to other artists. I re-mastered loud as hell and it sounded fine. I just dont know what to believe. 
840," Yes, but not most of them. Not often. "
841," For weather, F is more ideal actually. It had more granularity and for much of North America 100 is as hot as it ever gets and 0 is about as cold as it ever gets. "
842," Yeah this one really bothers me for some reason. My own friends, who I know are smart, say this shit. Our ape brains really are hard to transcend. "
843," The owners of this company are chinese nationals, not americans who think they are chinese or something. "
844, You would think that would also mean the the employees are free to organize and run their workplace as they see fit. 
845," your phone is not listening to you, at least not to sell you shit. it's called analytics. "
846, Use a floppier pick than you think you need. 
847, I love this guy. I remember hearing him on the Stone Cold podcast and he was great. 
848, I don't understand how anyone in europe does their laundry. 
849," It's a hollowbody, which i find isn't good for fast music or overdrive. "
850, That bass is great. I wouldnt play punk on it though. 
851, I always read one of the books and think its my new favorite then I read hbp again and Im like how could I have ever thought that? 
852, The podcast app has been deleted. 
853," I have a lot to say about this, and I feel particularly well suited to answer your question (my hardcore band just put out an LP that is almost entirely written in the octatonic scale so I think I know some of the stuffy academic theory behind punk music) but in the spirit of my comment, I will not say too much. What makes something punk is utilizing simplicity and embracing form (or lack therof). Musically, I liken it to haiku or abstract expressionism or something like that. 

A large part of perceived ""punkness"" will be the delivery- as passionately, violently, and heavily as possible (or the exact opposite of this). It has been over 40 years since the Ramones' first record came out. If the performer says it is punk music and/or the audience says it is, it is.

Finally, like it's cousin hip hop, punk is necessarily derivative. The music can be new, fresh, etc, but it is always a reimagining of something else. "
854," I am constantly struggling to get more space on my phone's flash memory. I finally deleted all the music files I had on my phone, and iTunes seems to have no idea how much space there is or isn't. iTunes thinks there are tons of podcast episodes. How do I get rid of them if I've already gotten rid of the app? "
855," With a ""B"". So many people don't understand what a disgusting amount of money that is. "
856," I have seen incredible players just plug into whatever, turn everything to noon and sound better than anyone. One guy told me he doesnt own an amp, just sets everything straight up and will see if he likes the bass knob turned up a little or not. Playing bass you can get away with a lot of different sounds as long as it holds up the rest of the band. "
857," Ive been playing for a long time, with many amps, with many crazy eqs. My style of playing I just want to know what mids I want to cut (muddy low mids usually) and what mids I want to boost (upper mids usually for a more guitar amp like tone. Exactly where the good spots are depends on the room and the cab. A lot of simpler bass amps have one or two static mid knobs. Ill try each one boost/cut and see it works or not. Most of the time Im not moving knobs around that much. The low and high are just general adjustments that usually my band mates ask for- more impact or less boom? Move the low knob. Not enough note definition/too much presence? Move the high knob. Certain styles have certain specific tones (dub/reggae come to mind) but even then there isnt much to getting that kind of sound.  

Now, when it comes to dirt pedals, weve got even more decisions than guitar players. That is for another thread though. "
858, All those sound great as documentary style shorts. 
859," Im going to make an alternative comment and tell you that amps are designed to sound about their best for most people with all the knobs at noon, 50% whatever. Ask yourself, what am I NOT getting out of this tone? Then adjust accordingly. I know thats simple but I think a lot of people, especially beginners, over think their tone. "
860, I love fantasy booking. 
861, Can you compare it to other amps? It's still a mystery amp for a lot of us I think. 
862," death to the coward gowron

long live duras "
863," I think I may have already taken this survey. Is there any way to tell?
edit: actually I don't think I've taken this. Do the questions change? "
864, It would be great if they got rid of the audience. 
865, Yeah iPhone sucks  
866," It looks like a common rat mod, an octave fuzz, and a boost all in one pedal. If you got a rat with that mod (fuzzrocious cat tail is the one I think most people are copying) an octave fuzz like the shin-ei or superfuzz I think you've got it. I'm pretty sure fuzzrocious sells a cat tail with a boost. Fuzzrat seems like a classic combo. I am not a fuzz guy and I've never been able to make a rat work for me so I don't know too much more. I bet the fuzzrocious dude already has a combo box that has those two circuits like that already OR he would make you one. Probably would come out around the same price as this thing AND he would come up with some funny sunn o)) pun to name it and custom paint it.

The trick with that rat/cat mod is the different clipping diodes available. I liked LED and ""no diode"" the best out of the usual choices. "
867," According to some sides the fan was saying some heinous shit. No one seems to be able to repeat whatever it was that made this ""over the line"" "
868, you can get a decal on ebay; it's surprisingly easy to put it on and it looks legit (if you get a legit-looking one) 
869, Mustangs and the like with fancy appointments like this are always funny to me since they are student guitars. 
870," Why are you fucking with me like this? With an iPhone, you can not adjust the volume until audio starts playing. Did you not know this? I am also not on headphones all god damn day. I just want a gif. We got gifs just fine for years until recently turds like you insist on mpegs that have to launch a separate app and are gigantic files compared to some dumb gif. "
871, Its definitely unreasonable. Whos afraid of talking about this? Why? This is alarmist nonsense. 
872," This is the first time Ric got the belt, right? Kansas City? "
873," What if the person transitioned before puberty, during puberty, or soon after? There are transwomen out there right now you would not be able to tell from ciswomen in some kind of athletic competition. There are also ciswomen who have taken male hormones to improve their performance. If they can test for that kind of doping, they can test for it in a transwoman I would think.

However, your alarmist attitude with ""under threat"" and all that is really off-putting. There is definitely room for discussion but if you're trying to look **not** transphobic that sort of alarmist language and attitude will do you no favors. "
874, A+ color mate standing ovation over here. 
875, I don't want to blast the sound to my immediate neighbors. Why is this so hard for you to understand? 
876," I sadly have an iphone, so audio has to start playing before I can adjust the volume. "
877, I dont know how I feel about a soft case underneath the plane. 
878, Yeah theres no way I will its way too much. They are pretty. I love mint green. 
879, *many* of us chief. Yes. A phone. In public. 
880," Damn. Thats some back in the day, pre 9-11 shit. They definitely wont let you have anything between your legs anymore. They are very strict about stowing carry-ons. Ill either take a chance with a cheap bass of mine or take my real bass apart and put it in a carry-on. "
881, Theres supposed to be a coat closet or something. I think most airlines would jump at the chance to call a bass too big so they can get money out of me. Im probably gonna take the neck off and cram it in a carry on suitcase full of my bands stupid shirts. 
882, Im not looking to check it. I have a flight case but a bass is oversized and an extra $200. Ill take the neck off and put it in a suitcase before that option. 
883, I was thinking the same thing. Maybe they are mint green o_O 
884, https://shop.fender.com/en-US/electric-guitars/jaguar/classic-player-jaguar-special-hh/0141713300.html 
885, and about $200. I don't see how it's that different. 
886," I see people with violins and guitars after security all the time, but any time I've ever asked an airline before buying a ticket they tell me I can't bring on an instrument unless I buy it a ticket. How are these people getting these past security and onto an airplane? "
887," This man will never retire, will he? "
888," Some of us are on platforms that do not support video or audio. For instance, I am at my lunch and I dont want to blast my coworkers with a loud ass YouTube video. "
889, Many of us are on platforms that cant support video/sound. Calm down. 
890, Sure is expensive. What's the difference between this and classic player? 
891, Damn I want one of those so bad. I don't care if it's corny! Great purchase. 
892, Why not just use one of those scooters people leave everywhere ;-) 
893, SHUT DA FACK UP 
894, Just get it out of my government why does it need to be on our money and in our classrooms and and in our courts? The only reason its there is to establish Christian dominance.

909,"  Bit pedantic, I think. ""Root"" in this context obviously means the lowest note.
 
 

Then say the ""bass"" note then. "
910, You should look at wikipedia. It really isn't that complicated. 
911," Searching the country for people, sending them to concentration camps, and then deporting them is not right. "
912," Under this logic, why doesn't that fellow start taking hormones, change his pronouns, and dressing differently? I'm really curious as to his answer to that question. "
913, This is why I love sausage. All those gross parts aren't eaten for a reason- **they're gross.** But when you mix them all up with stuff that tastes good you get sausage. I guess sausage is as close as I get to vegetarian these days ;-) 
914, Were you able to comprehend what was happening on 9/11? Do you have many memories before this time? The most extreme range I would agree with would be 81-93 or something like that. 
915," Quick, someone get on twitter! "
916, What the hell is this toad talking about? You think one day someone will be his girlfriend and he'll finally chill out? 
917, Who *is* the ancient runes teacher? 
918, the flair for this post is grammatically incorrect 
919, You're on the cusp! like the zodiac. GeNeRaTiOn ZoDiAc 
920, if you were in school *and you could comprehend what was happening* on 9/11. You need to have experienced life before it but not as an adult (21/22 and up in my mind). 
921," Holy shit 96 is so late. I feel like I have little in common with anyone born after 92 or so. That may be more due to a general age difference, though since the difference between 33 and 23 is so stark in US society. In ten years I might not feel that way. I'm also curious as to where 94, 95, 96 put themselves in *five* years, since I think it's hard for those folks to identify with the newest generation who have not had much time to define themselves (or be defined) yet.

In the past three years or so I started to NOT get every joke I saw on the internet, or understand some things culturally. For example, I don't know what Drake   Josh even is. There are these jokes about this show and I don't get them. I imagine the show is quite different from the adventures of Pete and Pete. "
922," Good for you. Which do you think is an easier goal to accomplish, rounding up people and deporting them, or helping them become citizens? "
923, 83-91 is what I would say. 
924, Where are you getting this information from? 
925, That's how I played the X wing game on N64 
926, the second list of generations isn't mine. is just used by people as a sort of shorthand since this stuff is subjective. 
927," Damn the ones where the batter flinches but the pitch turns out to be a strike are so brutal. It's like ""breaking"" a defender's ankles in basketball. I watched tons of baseball as a kid and I've never seen that.
E: Verlander walking off the mound before the ball even hits the catcher is also so ridiculous. What a badass. "
928, I think it depends on how you identify and what experiences you had. 
929," Remember and comprehend it. So 1991 is the last hard definitely-Millennial year, and it kinda fades off. 92 or 93 I think is ok. The cusp us the cusp. "
930," My personal rubric is if on September 11, 2001 you were 

1. in school or school-aged(undergrad college I count as school) and
1. able to understand what was going on on that day, in reference to the terror attacks. What was happening, who (vaguely) was doing it, and why (also vaguely).

I would call the undergrad cutoff to be 21-22 years, maybe a touch more, and the age I would say most kids would be able to understand something like that is 10 or so.

My reasoning is that the generation would need to know what life was like before 9/11, but not experience that life as adults. Some people will say

Millenial born 1980-2000

Gen X born 1960-1980

Boomer 1945-1960

Silent/Lucky 1925-1945

Greatest 1900-1925

You're saying there is a civilization hiding down there, more advanced than ours, and they are just staying hidden down there, secret? "
936,"  Its not hard to learn

Yes it is. "

edit: but yes there is a ticket in at my work with my complaint "
945," For sure. This does this in text input boxes and when you try and right click on highlighted text elsewhere. It's happened on everyone else's computer at work who uses chrome, including on other operating systems. "
946, Man my parents had these license plates for a while when I was growing up

1010," I've been listening to every version of this piece on Spotify and I'm starting to hear the differences. In my conductor's fantasy imagination I would put together all the parts that I like from each version and edit it for an orchestra to play. I'm just curious where all the true differences are. This is a piece where a lot of artistic license is taken and I think a lot of the recordings are not representative of any one version. So far I have found:

1913

This has to be pieced together by scholars and there is no published version.

1921

The ""Soviet"" edition that is not bound by copyright in the west, and thus is the source for many performances and recordings.

1947

This version seems to be the basis for a majority of the recordings (on Spotify at least)

1967

The final ""definitive"" version of Stravinsky's autograph. 

Orchestrations and articulations seem to be all over the place based on the dozen or so recordings I've heard. In some places chords are spelled totally different, and in others it seems like whole beats are missing. My study score is a Dover Miniature which if I had to guess would be a copy of the 1921 based on the notes. "

1018," Hi,

I have a project guitar that is going to have two Lace dually pickups in them. They are basically humbuckers that combine two of their famous sensor pickups (the ones with the colors). The neck will be two hot golds, and the bridge will be a red and a blue. Lace has a wiring diagram on how to do *one* of their pickups like this: http://www.lacemusic.com/pdf/9.pdf

I imagine it's possible to have a single switch that does this to both pickups simultaneously. Is it as simple as wiring that other pickup to the on/off/on switch? It's a strat-style, with three knobs and a 3 position lever switch on it. I'm down to leave the knobs as vol/tone/tone like a regular strat and drill a hole for the on/off/on switch. 

What I'd *really* like is to replace the 3 position switch with a 5 position, and have it do both bridge/red/blue/hb neck/single neck, but I am not sure if that is possible without extra switches.

Thanks! "
1019," At the end of Episode I Yoda is saying quite emphatically to Obi Wan that he does not approve of training the boy, but that the council agrees to let Obi Wan take him. It would seem to me that the council would need a unanimous vote for something as serious as this. Not only was he too old, Yoda (and probably others) can sense much fear in him and grave danger in continuing his training as a Jedi. 

I'm sure there was much discussion, but with Yoda and Mace Windu against training him, who could be for it? What arguments did they give to justify taking him into the order? I imagine it would have to be a 10-2 vote, because anything closer than that you'd think they'd either take more time or take the cautious route and forbid him from the order. Obi Wan says that he will train the boy either way, so I suppose it would mean expelling him from the order.

The only argument I can think of is that under the watchful eye of the Jedi, he would be less likely to turn. The fact that Obi Wan turns a blind eye to Anakin forming attachments is an interesting development in this context. Obi Wan committed a grave sin as well- he was attached to Anakin. "

1022," I feel like this question has to have been asked before, but I found nothing here or on AskScienceFiction.

I haven't found a canon answer, and only weak fanon answers. My guess is that one of Tagge's titles is ""Commander of..."" or some such. He's never referred to as General in the films, but the Tarkin book pretty much solidifies the fact that he is a general. It would make more sense if Tagge and Motti's titles were reversed- if you imagine Tagge as the admiral and Motti as the general, their discussion is easier to understand. The general sees no more use for the navy now that the Death Star is around- he does not have to rely on air support to help his troops pacify worlds- fear of the station itself will do so. For this reason, I don't understand why EU writers, legends and canon, would call him a general again.

As for the starfleet explanation, the other thing I've seen is that a General may be in charge of ships that deploy his troops. I think it's possible Motti is referring to the imperial military in general when he says starfleet. 

Does anyone have an alternative explanation? This is one of the biggest holes in SW in my opinion. "

1026," Last time I looked was like 15 years ago. There were *complete* soundtracks to IV and V, but VI was like a ""greatest hits"" and out of order, so was I. I've owned IV since it came out in the 90s, and it's a proper presentation, like a classical release. It has a substantial bit of documentation, 100% of the music, in order, and a few bonus takes and an alternate cue that was never used. It may have also been re-mastered. Plus it's bound like a book and is not in a shitty plastic CD case. I was listening on Spotify and noticed only the greatest hits editions existed, and a search of this sub says that Sony retained the rights to the proper ones, so only the crappy ones are available. Seems pretty silly Lucasfilm doesn't have rights to the music that's in its own films. Are there complete editions of anything other than IV and V? If not it's a real shame. The music for these films, (along with Howard Shore's *The Lord of the Rings*) is the greatest achievement in film music in the last 60-ish years (maybe ever), and I think it's absolutely criminal there are not complete editions for serious listeners.


Does anyone know if there are real soundtracks for the rest of the films? Do they exist digitally? I'd be very down to drop a 150 bucks or whatever right this second to complete my collection in CDs, and I would be even more stoked if I could just put them on my phone without having to hunt down a CD drive to rip them "

1041," This episode made me think of this idea I've had, so I drafted an email to send to the show, but I can't find an email address for the show so I figured I would post it here and maybe it would get to the guys or not. Either way, I would like to hear other people's thoughts about it.

Hi Scott and Forrest,
I was listening to your latest episode and it made me think about my own Grand Unifying Theory of the paranormal that I have had for the past several years.

My theory is that all paranormal events are some sort of special type of hallucination that we human beings are all capable of. I think this is the most robust explanation for the majority of these sorts of phenomena. It would explain why paranormal reports have odd features like creatures/portals being 2 dimensional, UFOs making no sound, bigfoot floating and making no sound, etc. I think it is also telling that the types of phenomena that people report conform to their own personal beliefs or cultures- People who are more spiritual are the ones who report ghosts, skin walkers show up for people with native american heritages or interest in those cultures, UFOs show up for more skeptical people (UFOs seem to have the most non-spiritual justifications for existing). Something along the lines of if you go looking for something you will find it. This would also explain why you cant catch this stuff on video.

The only weak part of my theory are events with multiple witnesses. My explanation here is a little woo woo but it goes something like this: These sorts of hallucination events can be shared by people nearby each other; and I think the more familiar the two people are with each other (like friends or family members) the more likely they are to see the same thing. Think about any of the reports for paranormal happenings that have multiple witnesses. How often are those witnesses complete strangers? More than likely they are family members. I think it works the same way mass hysteria does. There is some animal form of seemingly telepathic communication we as human beings share. I believe its some sort of warning system from our ancestors to alert the family group of danger, just gone haywire; what with eons of language and toolmaking and all that. This would be why the more part of the tribe two or more people are, the more likely they are to have experiences like this that are shared.

Another feature I should mention is that many of these reports lack direct engagement with the phenomenon. The sighting is either brief, peripheral, and lacking of any serious action other than simple movement. I think this further confirms my theory. Reports that go beyond this are often hard to believe (like being captured by bigfoots) and most certainly lack co-oberation. 

I have loved the paranormal since I was a child, but I have been an extreme skeptic my entire life as well. Your podcast this week had many features that made me think of my theory and I thought I would share it with you. I will say that I definitely saw a UFO before I formed my theory, and that my sighting was brief, but not so brief that I wasnt 100% sure that what I was looking at wasnt a flying saucer and not something else. I think it is a fun exercise to think of this theory any time you hear a paranormal report. I know I usually do. 

Thanks for the great show; its the only podcast I listen to every episode of.

1042," I've had a few shares of Disney stock since I was a little boy (1990) and it has done really really well since then. At this point though, should I just cash out and use it to pay down my debt? I owe $2k on 20% APR credit card, another $900 on a zero interest card (I'll be able to pay it off before the introductory period expires), and $4800 on a loan with a 13% interest rate and 18% APR. At first I thought cashing out was a good idea, but I don't think paying $500 now will save me that much in the long run. I also have around $3500 in a 401k, but I have been putting my max employer match into it every paycheck, so I think I should leave that the way it is since it's free money. I expect to clear all of that debt within the next three years. Should I just hold on to the stock? Should I put it in with my 401k? "

1044," Trek has always had great music. Even the dated-sounding music from TOS and the first few seasons of TNG have true artistry and craft applied to them (and I happen to like those specific styles).

1045," Hi.

I do a lot of DIY shows, and the PA I've been using for that is near the end of its life. I want an active system that will be at home in super loud, small basements, living rooms, and cramped practice spaces. It's exclusively for vocals to be heard over bands that are too loud. My budget is $800 MAP (I'll try and get used if I can).

The obvious choice is the ZLX12P, but I'm also considering the SRM350v3. They spec out about the same, but the SRM is lighter. I've had experience with the ZLX series, but I've only heard the larger SRMs, and even then only as a DJ speaker (most likely was the v2 series).

I feel like I should go with the Mackie, but I'm hesitant because comparing the two brands side by side isn't fair- all the Mackie gear I've ever come across is clearly budget gear, wheras EV stuff seems like it's built a lot better. ZLXs seem to compress and limit sooner than a lot of other speakers, and kinda turn to mush at loud volumes. The Mackies will probably not sound as ""good"" but with a 10"" woofer I feel like they are better suited for the task. The Mackies have a built in 4 band feedback killer as well, which is really nice considering the environment they're going to go in. What do you guys think? "
1046," I've been shaving with a DE for six months now, and I'm almost out of soap and blades. I'm wondering if it's worth it for me to keep it up- I don't really see any advantages over using disposable razors and regular shaving cream, other than the price. Even then, it's not that much more expensive to use the cheap bic two blade razors, which work just fine. 

Am I missing something? Do I need to stick it out and keep trying? DE shaving has only made it more difficult for me to get a good shave, made me more prone to cuts, done nothing positive for my skin, and makes my shower/shave time take four times longer. I can imagine that DE shaving isn't for everyone, but I *want* it to be for me, and I don't know what I am doing wrong. "

1048," I think this should be on your guys' sidebar. It looks like Trump has only taken an official position on 5 issues. The issues that concern me the most are the economy, addressing climate change, and instituting a single payer universal health care system in our country. I am also against the increasing grip that corporations and the very rich have on this country.

I saw a quote somewhere that said Trump supports single payer, which honestly shocked me. It would seem that most people on reddit are anti-Trump, so I wanted to see why you guys support him and why you think others should as well. 

As for his policies-


* Immigration- I don't care. I do not think we need any reforms here and I certainly think the ""Mexico wall"" is a waste of money and resources that could be better spent elsewhere

* VA- I agree here; I think we should have a healthcare system like this for every citizen.

* China- I'm half way on this one. I'm for most of this except for lowering the corporate tax rate, and deploying our military.

* Taxes- I am against this sort of ""flat"" taxing. I believe in a steeper, more regressive income tax, with no way for the wealthy or corporations to get out of paying. I am pro-""death tax"". I would gladly pay more in taxes for a ""medicare for all"" system.

* Guns- I couldn't care any less. I think if you want guns get guns. I would rather see a national free mental health program for all residents than any kind of firearms reform.

I don't see Trump directly addressing our economic issues, climate change, healthcare, or money in politics; at least not officially. Why should I vote Trump? "

1065," I'm having a bit of an issue with what to do with the city connection they give you in this game.

All I can find online are 24"" long cables- I'd like shorter lengths and the ability to specify angle or straight ends. I'd also like a daisy chain option but not 5+ at a time- more like 1 or two. I doubt such custom orders exist for such low cost items, but 18-24"" seems like a lot for a pedalboard that really needs 3-12"" worth of this cabling. "

Specifically, he's looking to talk to anyone who tries to get as little sleep as possible, or anyone who tries to wake/rest with the sun. PM me or comment if you might know what direction to point us in our search for sleep experimenters. Thanks! "

1079," I groaned when the introduced this character on DS9, and was even more bummed once I realized he was going to be a recurring character. But I just watched his two major episodes in the last season, and I've grown to like him a lot. It's an interesting choice for the writers to make a holo deck character like him such an integral part of the show. Anyone else think he was super corny and grow to like him? "

Strange situation at the Apple store when I went to pick it up. I asked the genius who handed my computer over for more details, long story short the only note on my ticket was ""foul smell of urine coming from machine."" I asked the genius if this might be a reason for them not working on it, he said it was a possibility, and I understood. I was frustrated because when I dropped the computer off I noted to the genius writing my ticket that it was beer that I spilled on the keyboard, but she just wrote ""liquid."" I can understand why someone might think that spilled beer smells like urine, and refuse to work on such a machine.

I took it to a place called U BREAK I FIX and they did a cleaning for free, but they said their diagnostic was inconclusive and it just boot-looped (I told them that's what it does, I don't know why they couldn't run a diagnostic to find the problem, but whatever). Gazelle will only give me $100 for it. What do you guys think it's worth on eBay in an ""as-is"" sale? It's a 2013 MBP 2.9 i7 750GB HD with 8 GB ram. "
1082," I recently spilled a little bit of liquid on my Macbook pro. I took it to the Apple store for service, and now they're telling me according to their diagnostic that they can not repair it and are going to send it back to me. I guess the motherboard is fried. Do I have any options as far as third-party repairs or refurbishment? I feel like some minor liquid damage would be repairable in most instances. It's such a huge bummer because the computer is less than a year old. They quoted me $755 to fix it, I sure hope they don't want that amount from me just to tell me they can't fix it. Has anyone else ever dealt with a situation like this? Any help is appreciated. "

1085," I had dimarzio area pickups in my strat for the longest time- 54,  67, and 61 in neck middle and bridge respectively. the bridge was always too bright and twangy for my tastes so i recently swapped it out for a Wilde L45s. It sounds tons better but now position 4 (bridge and middle) is complete garbage. I really like the classic ""quack"" sound of the 2 and 4 positions and the areas excelled in producing this. I think the solution would be to wire the bridge pickup in such a way that only one blade of the L45 is active in the 4 position. Is there a way to do this or am I still cursed with only having 4 of my 5 pickup positions useable? Bill lawrence also sells a ""q-filter"" and i'm curious as to what it does. "
1086," I have an old sim city 4 for mac cd and I was looking into playing it again, because sc5 has become pretty boring for me. I have a few questions:

Is there a way to play this game straight off of my laptop without having to have the cd in the computer? From what I remember I always had to insert the disc to play.

What mod kits should I apply? Is there a basic ""pack"" that everyone starts with, or will I have to do more research into what works for mac and what I need? "
1087," I just got the game last month, and in the last week I have been playing 1v1 vs the AI. I can beat the AI on hard almost every time, but lose vs harder.

I played a few 1v1 matches unranked and got shredded every time. I have watched tons of videos and read every article there is for beginner players. I have been practicing [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExjpGpyDNwI) build, mostly because he has an audio guide that I can practice in custom games to.

What I need help with is multitasking and apm. It's very hard for me to manage even a basic early base or two at the speed required in 1v1 play. I practice the above build all the time but usually falter sometime after I build my third barracks. I was practicing at a slower speed with the build order written down but I found it to be counterproductive. I don't seem to be making much progress in the above build- I complete it all the way through about 1 out of 5 times. Needless to say this is very frustrating.

Are there any resources like mp3 files or other videos to play while I practice? I have a feeling that 15 gas might not be the best build for a newb. What I would really like is a custom map that has cues at what time to do what thing. Does anything like that exist? My goal isn't even to win against a human opponent, just put up a decent fight. I don't think I'm ever going to get there. "

1089, I look at my city and I have apartment buildings full of people and industrial and commercial buildings closed because they can't get enough workers. Some of the larger industrial buildings have near 300 workers and are still closed. Is this another broken aspect of the game? I have had problems in the past with getting the students to attend different schools as well. It sure seems like my zoning guy is asking me to zone residential all the time. 
1090," Device: mid 2012 Macbook Pro. 2.9 ghz i7 8gb ram

I just came back into town after being gone for a couple of months, and I'm noticing a strange behavior with my wifi. I'll be browsing and after about a minute everything refuses to load or loads very slowly. If I click on the wifi icon in the menu bar the menu that pops up says ""Looking for networks"" for a few seconds then finds my network and confirms I'm connected. As soon as this happens, pages and images start loading at their normal speed again. 
What gives? 
I don't know if anyone else knows about this trick, but I used to do it every so often with my old 2008 mac book from time to time as well, but I never had to do it this often.

Note: I am the only device connected to the network currently, all of my roomates are out today. "

1092," ""Cravings"" are discussed on here quite a bit, and it seems that there is a lot of literature devoted to overcoming this sort of feeling. As a person who is on their 15th quit attempt, I find these brief ""cravings"" quite easy to overcome. What my concern is (and where I always fail) are the paranoid, depressed, nervous, psychoses that occur a week or two after cessation and continue for who knows how long. These sorts of feelings last all day or for multiple days.

At more than a week and less than a month (usually) I run into these paranoid episodes; where I am basically having an anxiety attack all day. All of my ""craving"" suppression activities (exercise, gum, fruit juice, deep breathing) do not affect this feeling. The only thing that seems to cure these is a night's sleep. 

The other issue I have usually occurs after the one month point, and may be unique to me because I used to take medication for it. I feel depressed. All day, every day, forever. I don't wan't to do anything at all. Get out of bed, anything. I haven't gotten this far in a while, but I know it's coming. The last time I quit for more than a week, I ran into this depression, and found it incurable.

Until this year I had given up on quitting for about four years. I am giving my fourth quit attempt this year an earnest try, but confident is certainly not a word I would use to describe how I feel. Is there anyone who can provide some useful insight or counsel about these issues? If I don't get through this time I am going to attempt with drug therapy.

1093," So I've been wearing a pair of sanfordized Taylor stitch jeans for about six solid months. I soaked them in lukewarm water when I got them, and have been spot cleaning from time to time with a cotton rag and warm water. I have been noticing some dirt accumulating and today I am aware of a mild stink. How should I wash these guys with minimal fading? Is there a guide to washing somewhere online? Sorry if this is a dumb question, I am new to this world. "

1095," This is my 13th attempt at quitting. Usually I get father than this before I run into this problem, but I've been having anxiety for hours now and now it keeps getting worse. Usually I can wait out the crave wave because it only lasts a few minutes, but for a good four hours now, I've been losing my mind. What can I do? I've been doing pushups whenever I get like this, but I'm not in a place where I can right now. Help? "
1096," I'm looking for a sheet of 12 blank channel strips that I can make copies of and write on for soundchecks. I'm about to go on tour and would like to be able to write down my settings just in case I run into a smaller board and the opening acts have to share channels. I know a lot of people take pictures with their phones, but my phone's camera kind of sucks and I feel that this is a way easier way to do this. Thanks! "

1098," I have a pair of skinny straight dickies that are looking the worse for wear after being work/casual pants for me for about 2 years. I have a pair of the double-knee skinny work pants that seem to be constructed a bit better, and I've had them for about a year, but the color is starting to fade a bit. Anyone know of a higher quality manufacturer of this type of pant that has a ""skinny"" or ""slim straight"" fit? "

1100," Hi, I have a 1998 mexican 50s stratocaster that I have replaced the pickups on a few years ago. I am very happy with the sound, other than the bridge pickup being much brighter than the neck and middle (sucks that this is the only pickup that the tone control does not affect.) I installed dimarzio area pickups in their recommended configuration: 58 in the neck, 67 in the middle, and 61 in the bridge. Like i said, the bridge is waaay to bright compared to the others; often i have to re-eq my amp or gain pedals to compensate for this, and it's kind of a pain. I am looking at the new paul gilbert injector pickup as a replacement, because i do want a slightly thicker sound out of my bridge as well as a bit less treble. I have also considered the cruiser bridge pickup and the heavy blues 2. I am leaning towards the paul gilbert however because of it's recommendation by dimarzio as a pair for the area pickups. I very much value the distinct sound of the 2 and 4 positions, and i'd like to preserve that sound.

So, If anyone has used any of these pickups or has a recommendation for a replacement, I appreciate any help.

Thanks!  "
1101," I am in need of a vst plugin or standalone program that can vary the pitch and or speed of a wav file or track. I am learning a band's songs, but since I joined the band we have started tuning down a whole step. I don't mind paying for a program like this, but it would be nice if there was a free one. Thanks for your help, guys. "
1102," I'm going to be taking over at a venue that has graphics on its mains and two of its monitor channels. I'm planning on ringing out both, but I'm also open to the idea of a program that sends frequencies and detects what sort of levels graphics should be set at to avoid feedback. I was mostly going to set the mains eq to taste, but it'd be great if there was something that spat out the different SI frequencies so I could tune from a more scientific standpoint. "
1103," I have a basic understanding of this concept, but I need a few things clarified- here's what I know (please correct me where I'm wrong):

The difference between these signals is impedance. ""Line"" is the strongest signal, i.e. the signal with the lowest impedance. This is ""mixer"" level. A line level signal going into a mixer should have the input gain trim all the way down. Line is what comes out of your ipod or whatever to drive headphones. ""Instrument"" is the next highest impedance, and it's what comes out of an electric guitar or electric piano (like a rhodes) and it needs a preamp of some sort to get up to ""line"" level before being sent to a poweramp and speakers. ""Mic"" is next and needs even more pregain to be at unity on a mixer.

My main questions:

1. What is ""balanced"" and what is ""unbalanced""? i've heard that you need a ""balanced"" 1/4 in cable to run a balanced signal using this sort of connector.

2. What is Hi-Z and Low-Z? I know most 1/4 instrument cables are called ""Hi-Z"" and XLR cables are ""Lo-Z."" What about ""speaker"" 1/4 in cables and Neutrik/Speakon cables?

3. What exactly are the impedance levels in ohms for ""Mic"" ""Instrument"" and ""Line?"" Can I plug an Ipod straight into a poweramp and run speakers without a mixer?

Thanks for your expertise r/audioengineering. I hope this isn't a stupid question. "
