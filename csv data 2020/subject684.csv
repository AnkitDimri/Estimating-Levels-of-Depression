0," Nats and Caps should just get over it and fuck already, gosh "
1," Man, Jordan Zimmermann is one of my favorite players and I just hate what's happened to him. "
2," What other memes are you trying to keep under wraps? Release the tapes, the people must know! "
3," A few days on some radio I heard a clip of someone talking with Kendrick about his options and he said ""I got another year"". Of course it was in the post-championship afterglow so maybe he walks it back but he'll probably be playing. "

5, Press X to DONG 
6, Fuck Luhnow too. Starts and ends with him. 
7," I hope it doesn't matter either way, but I think you go Corbin with a short leash. 

Astros haven't done much against him tonight, throw him out there and have Hudson ready for the switch-up if need be. "
8, Keep tacking on. As much breathing room as possible. I don't want to be hurt again. 
9, Have someone else up with Hudson. Hopefully you never need to use that other guy (assumably Doolittle) but it's just dumb not to have the insurance if necessary. 
10," I'll bitch about the umps in this series until the end of time, but that was a terrible call and was a huge disservice to the Astros. "
11," Should have had Suzuki and MAT there. But kudos to Kendrick any way, a definite Nats legend. "
12, Greinke doesn't need the help. Stop giving him every fucking call.

14, The worst part is this was evident from the 1st. You had to get someone up quick. 
15, Ball 1 to Gurriel was 1000x more a strike than strike 2 to Zimmerman. This is insane. 
16, Holy fuck we're getting robbed in daylight and the cops are laughing at us. 
17, We're honestly lucky to only be down 1. The bats are fucking putrid. 
18, I'm sure if we keep limiting him to 10 pitches an inning we'll get in in the 17th inning. 
19, wE'rE gEtTiNg GoOd CoNtAcT nO rEaSoN tO pAnIc GuYs 
20," But it wasn't a double, it hung in the air and we have one baserunner. This isn't a 162-game season. "
21, Better start seeing longer bats next inning. 
22, Get someone warming up. 
23," I love Cabrera. Not his best series this round, but he was good for us leading up to the playoffs and has had his moments. "
24," I'm still mad about that call and don't understand how Gomes was sent back to 1st. A double play wasn't attempted, it's not like Gomes hesitated and waited until it looked like Trea would make it to run to second. 

That was an advance to second and a bang-bang play all the fucking way. How are you literally going to reward the team twice for making an errant throw? "
25, Should be 6-2. 
26, rigged sry i saw it live 
27," Why the fuck is Robles still hitting, Davey? "
28, BENCH ROBLES 
29, Robles has looked gimpy running and is swinging a 100 lb. bat right now. I hate to say it but they should be thinking about putting in MAT. 
30, Thanks for showing up Strasburg. 
31, Welp. 
32, Why is Eaton in such a rush to give away outs? 
33, I love Rendon but he's been terrible outside of that two-run double. 
34," Thank you for the explanation, that makes sense and I don't like it. "
35," What's the practical reason for having two guys doing the same job for the same thing, with the only difference being what they're watching on? "
36," Game MVP: Rendon swinging early non-stop. I know it's had success for us this postseason, but postseason is all about adjustments and trying new things. "
37," How did Eaton not score?

Edit: Nevermind, thought he hesitated but that was just a good bounce and pick up. "
38," Rendon needs to stop swinging early. It's clearly not working, adjust. "
39," How was that first pitch a strike, in what fucking world. "
40," That's so annoying, the run was on a silver platter. "
41, Bad defensive game for Soto. 
42," Rodney, in theory, is great. Experience out the ass, chill guy to have around, still throws pretty well given his age.

Rodney, in reality, is a fucking rollercoaster and we have to be prepared to exit MR RODNEYS WILD RIDE at a moment's notice. "
43, Gotta love Abbacus Caboodle. 
44," Anything but Rodney. I'll talk, I swear! "
45," Don't blame the 12-year-old for crushing, it's the parents' fault for signing the permission slip for a 10-year-old to play in the world series. And the MLB shouldn't be absolved either, they shouldn't have allowed someone who's 8 to play either. "
46," I feel like we suck more than most teams against submarine pitchers. Don't have the stats handy to back it up right now though, I'm lazy. "
47," I don't blame Hudson or Davey (as much as I hate to say the latter) for this if it goes wrong, it's the right call. 

You get lefty on lefty and don't want to overextend Hudson on one game. All up to Doolittle and hopefully the bats for insurance. "
48," I'm not saying those are easy or that I could do them, but those were shit plays by Robles and Eaton. "
49, The spirit of Harper lives on. 
50, Please Hudson. 
51, Fuck. 
52, Short. Leash. 
53, Siiick! Siiick! 
54, Scherzer looking high-key like Gio right now. 
55," Jesus fuck, Max, throw a fucking strike. "
56, This would be the perfect time to have Voth start warming up. Instead we'll put in Suero who is conceding the game. 
57, I'm so sick of Eaton always trying to bunt. Rarely works out. 
58," The year is 2025. 

SpaceX just released their first model of teleporter booths and are boasting only a 1% mutation rate. President Fred Durst is in his second term promising a ""brand new edition"" to the Oval Office, and I await for the results of the 2019 World Series as the anthem has just ended. "
59, Remember the time Howie Kendrick showed up at halftime and the Nationals won the Bourbon Bowl? 
60," *""Well, Snyder, have the lambs stopped screaming?""* "
61," Guys, you don't *have* to hit home runs. "
62," Just can't have an easy win, can we. "
63, We need more runs. 
64," Don't you even joke about putting Rodney in, Martinez. "
65, Pull him immediately. 
66, DFA Strasburg. 
67, I've never seen the Cardinals so shook. 
68, Ruined the Brazil smh 
69, I'm afraid to believe. 
70, I've never seen a better metaphor for my life than that Cardinals LFer bending down and ready to launch a howitzer but somehow missing the ball. 
71," ""*A Murder of One*"" is not just a fantastic song by the Counting Crows, but a prophecy of Jose Ramirez's 2019 NLCS. "
72," Yeah I realize, and though there are a few games I don't expect to play soon, it's a temporary band-aid at best. Might as well bite the bullet now. Thanks though. "
73," I wish I could, but alas I can't play Rocket League until I get more space for the update, and I cannot wait. Thanks for the wisdom though. "
74, Does anyone have any recommendations for micro SD cards? Finally ran out of space on the Switch. Would prefer more size so I hopefully never have to buy another one. 
75, Yeah that was a bad strike call. 
76," I did, have you been watching this entire postseason? "
77, Can Eaton do fucking anything? 
78," He died for our sins.

Bless you Jay. "
79, Is this what happiness feels like? 
80," I feel like Hudson's due for runs and I hope he's not but if he is it's not on him. He was great for us, good pickup. Hope he sticks around next season regardless. "
81, Everyone's doing their best Espinosa impressions. Just absolutely awful. 
82, Gomes is terrible. At least Suzuki looks like he's swung a bat before. 
83, I hate Eaton. 
84,"  The bats need to have a fucking game FOR ONCE

2012 Game 5, but unfortunately Gio Gio'd. "
85," Seeing a lot of ""they're getting good wood"" here. We're not taking long to get to the bargaining phase. "
86, How nice of Strasburg to show up. 
87, If Strasburg can pitch well enough to subtract a past run from the Dodgers that would be impressive. 
88," Nats and Game 5, name a more iconic duo. "
89, Ball don't lie. 
90, How do you get caught down in that situation? Davey and Howie are idiots. 
91," Admirable defense but no. You're telling me over 162 games they don't think to post anything? And it's fucking Reddit. We're all assholes. Just finding the right place to show it.

It's bandwagoners and they're as stupid as they are annoying. "
92," One of my favorite things about these games is all the idiots calling people out fans for being dour about our situation.

90% of these people I see bitching about Nats fans don't show up a single fucking dick in random Nats regular season games.

Don't fucking police other people, actually show up in game threads. At least some of the people I can respect for always talking shit about me or pessimistic people in general. If you're going to act so supportive and shit on people, do it during the regular season too. "
93, Nice retort. 8/10 got me. 
94,"  Putting Suero in is literally just being baseball daft.

This sub was sucking off Rizzo for putting Suero on the roster for his low FIP. "
95," Fire Rizzo and Davey. Fuck the Wildcard game, you make a terrible bullpen this often and misplay that bullpen this bad you don't deserve your jobs. "
96," Enjoy your feeling of superiority, it will do you dick while you watch Corbin masturbate into a wad of cash after exiting us out of the playoffs. "
97," His last start was shit. He literally walked in the first run. He got lucky a few times but that start was nothing to hang his kid on. But keep hanging onto that thought, ""kid"". "
98, Other than the jersey number I don't see a difference between this and Gio Gonzalez. Corbin is absolute garbage. 
99, Great is a huge overstatement. And why the fuck should I care about his regular season if he can't throw strikes in the postseason? 
100, $140MM for this trash ass pitcher. 
101, Waiting for Eaton to do anything other than trash minor league players who aren't even earning enough to live. 
102," ""what a wimp conceding defeat after one rough game, not a true fan""

-poster whose last post in sub was October 2017 "
103," Oh, this shitty logic again. You might find it hard to believe but teams do win 1-0 and 2-1. 

Offense was shit again and obviously that's a problem, but it literally does matter. It puts more pressure on the offense and starters and gives you less margin for error when you're literally throwing adult baseball league caliber players into MLB games. "
104," Him striking out Bellinger was a miracle, and those rarely happen twice. It's Rizzo's fault for failing to build a bullpen that isn't better without Rodney and for hiring a dipshit manager like Davey. 

Expected and painful but not really mad. We did this to ourselves and we all saw it coming. "
105," Rodney for Bellinger? Holy shit, are you kidding me? That's a fireable offense no matter the outcome. "
106, Are there any free apps that carry 106.7 (preferably) or any other station that carry radio broadcasts for the Nats games? 
107, Bad luck doesn't explain the showing we've had tonight. 
108, Umpire wasn't great but most of his balls weren't even close enough to be mad at the ump. The couple that were sucked but this is mostly Corbin's own doing scoring-wise. 
109," No shit, give me some more deep-digging baseball analysis. "
110," Corbin got lucky as fuck tonight. People will say ""but only two runs!"" but he was pretty damn shitty. That's not forgiving the offense, but a guy with his talent and salary really should do better. "
111, We better be ready to get Voth warmed. That was fucking atrocious. 
112, If the point of the game was to throw balls at the dirt Corbin would be Pedro Martinez. 
113, It'd be cool if Corbin threw strikes. 
114,"  you'd probably be like ""ok, it's probably a close game but I feel ok about this"".

Only if you're unfamiliar with Nats October offense. "

121," Because Jay knows quarterbacks and as far as I can tell, Allen and Snyder's only real talents are wasting money and fucking over fans. "
122," This subreddit is a hug box. What the Redskins have done to deserve such blind faith, I have no idea, but there it is. "
123," Good one, got me. I'll now go reconsider talking bad about this clearly functional team. "
124," I just love that people have been calling for Haskins to play since the season started, bemoaning that Keenum sucks and he needs to learn. Then in the game thread bitching that we put him in when everyone's been hollering for him to play. 

Jay may be a terrible call player and conservative to a fault on the field, but he has a good system and knows quarterbacks. It's clear he wasn't ready and may never be, but at least people got what they wanted. "
125, Which is why it's fucking hilarious and stupid that Dan thinks this roster is good. 
126, Many of them will because they're dumb or young. Only time and experience can beat sense into them.

128, They've run a screen multiple times and we still aren't even close to prepared for them. How. 
129, Norman burned again. Shocker. 
130," It's like Norm Macdonald telling a bad joke. You know what's happening, you can basically guess the punchline, but you laugh because you admire the balls to do it. "
131," I mean that's true, but that happens all the time in sports and MVP awards. "
132," No, I watched, your take is just bad. It's impossible to hold that team scoreless. To hold them to 14 was unprecedented and a minor miracle. A TD drive doesn't count for extra points depending on where you score it. 

The fact was a bunch of other QBs could have won that game with the luxury of a defense holding them to 14, and many of them wouldn't have made it so you had to rely on a miracle catch and last minute touchdown.

The defensive line was more valuable and instrumental to that win than Eli Manning. Straight up. "
133," It's not hard, they've had split MVPs before. They just don't want to. And I already said it should have been Tuck in my opinion. "
134," Terrible take. If the Giants defense doesn't ball their asses off there's never a game to be won. If you put up points earlier, you don't have to come back. 

Through the whole season, the Patriots defense gave up over 17 points 7 different times in 18 attempts, and exactly 17 points a few more. Leading up to the Super Bowl, guess how many teams held their offense under 20? "
135," Him winning the first MVP is a joke. Holding that offense to 14 points, it should have gone to one or multiple defensive players (I would argue Tuck). The QP MVP is basically default unless another offensive players really stands out.

Second one is deserved though, I'll give him that. "

137, To me? No. To some people on this sub? Yes.

139, The blatant lack of pressure. Literally fuck yourself. 
140, Another great job by the defensive line everyone's been raving about all Spring. 
141," If getting the wild card means status quo, I hope we lose out. This team is broken. "
142, no u

144," Our (yours, mine, everyone else's in the sub) attitudes literally do not matter. Literally. I cannot stress that enough. "
145," It's their only contact with the outside world otherwise they'd have to go outside and be in Georgia, go easy on them. "
146," Because it's dumb. Fans don't have any effect on the game and no financial incentive for the players to play well. The players do. And we've seen the team go to sleep when they hit a skid numerous times before. It happens to literally every team at some point. Anyone who is logical wouldn't choose to be a Nats fan, the fact people are here and bitching after years of dry handjobs of seasons is the opposite of ""giving up"". "
147, How the fuck is that a strike. 
148, Imagine saying this thinking it's a salient point. 
149, Because Rizzo is bad. 
150, At least Raudy got a hit and a nice caught stealing. And Rendon doing Rendon things. Other than that this game should be stricken from history. 
151, I like F.P. making the troubled mind excuse for Rodney like he hasn't been garbage all season. 
152," So is Rodney's fucking aim, apparently neither matters. "
153," This sub will suck his dick until the cum comes home but Rizzo's absolutely fucking failures at building a bullpen multiple years running is a firaeble offense. You almost have to try to start a season with such a bad bullpen year in and year out.

And the saddest of all is this is somehow the ""upgraded"" bullpen after his yearly cleaning up of his own mess. "
154, This team is going to get smoked in the playoffs. 
155," Nats against bad teams: our bad start doesn't define us we're a really good team

Nats against good teams: i sleep "
156," So we can win against shitty teams and lose against good ones. So what? Even if we get to the playoffs, we're getting absolutely smoked. The team should be better than that, Rizzo's been building for better than that, and all we have to show for it is a dipshit manager and a streaky team that collapses under pressure. "
157, Mr. Big CC 
158, That's one of the lines that's burned into my brain permanently. Just his delivery is so fucking funny I think of it all the time in situations where I or someone else fucked up and is playing it off. 
159,"  I beat it once for the music change on the menu screens and I can't bring myself to do it again

I did that as well and was so disappointed when it was basically only Smash Bros title music options. I assumed it would be any song you wanted and was excited for a revolving door of whatever song I was feeling at the moment. "
160, Rodney and Elias are unpitchable on any playoff roster except for one in a zany baseball comedy movie. 
161,"  I dont understand why so many people have been refusing to face that reality for the last couple weeks when we were scorching hot and still couldnt gain on them.

Because this sub is a hugbox for the team. "
162, It was in the some of the custom made smash stages they made when showing off the stage builder. 
163," I know a lot of people will say it doesn't mean anything, but they showed a bunch of dragons and a witch in the Joker presentation video and a lot of people thought it could hint to Dragon Quest and Banjo. Sure enough they were the next fighters though most people thinking that was a hint got downvoted to hell. I really think there is something about souls being hinted at. "
164, I have a good feeling that will end up one of the Nats Classics that gets played during the offseasons. 
165, Too bad Elias was trash and Turner an idiot or we could be looking at a W. 
166, Oh hey 2015 long time no see 
167, That happens to tons of players in tons of cities. Ovechkin turned out okay. What a lame excuse. 
168, He should have never been out there. Should have been Kendrick. We all knew it but Dusty gonna Dusty. 
169, You know who'd be good in the 8th inning these days? Shawn Kelley or Brandon Kintzler. 
170," ""He's our 8th inning guy"" "
171," I think MC would be cooler just because it'd be very WTF, also I think the needler would be a cool move in Smash. Nothing against Doom though, I'd be fine with that. "
172, That was Daniel Murphy without the awesome bat to back it up. 
173, I can't believe Eaton actually dragged a bunt. He's usually terrible at it. 
174," Sounds good, see you on there. "
175," I'm Plat II but NA East Switch but happy to play with you sometime if you want. As long as you aren't toxic and ""What a save!""ing people. Don't buy keys or open crates so not much there to trade you but if you don't feel like doing solo RL I'm down as long as I'm not already partied up. Mike#9912. "
176," Happy to play with you guys if you're chill and don't constantly ""what a save!"". I'm Plat 2 currently in 2s and 3s. I'm not often on at that time due to work but am occasionally. NA East and on Switch. Also on the weekends frequently. Mike#9912 if you feel like playing. "
177," I'm Mike #9912 if you feel like playing. NA East, Plat 2, just chilling. "
178," You should feel good. The majority players of and the ""average"" RL player is in Gold. And it takes most people 1k hours at least in order to get to GC. 

Playing solo is frustrating but I think it helps a lot. And you never know, might run into someone who would be willing to team with you. I play on Switch and I have 60+ Switch friends and 10+ non-Switch friends. Some no longer play but I've played with quite a few that I sync up well with.

I'd also recommend watching Lethamyr's early ranked videos on Youtube. He does a good job of explaining what he's doing and why, helped me cut down on stupid challenges. "
179, I hardly qualify most of that as dislike. Most of it is pretty mild criticism and most people are saying they like him. Strangely no criticism of his biggest flaw which is confusing players who look nothing alike or without similar names. 
180, I still think he's coming up with an excuse to deflect from the fact he fucked up his feet. 
181," https://old.reddit.com/r/Nationals/comments/cpw6nn/why_does_everyone_hate_bob_fp/

Almost everyone on the Nats sub fellates them. "
182, F.P. sucks ass too. I would love to have Charlie and Dave just take over the TV broadcast. 
183, So what genre is this game? It looks interesting and not a turn-based RPG which is a genre I have a hard time getting into. But I'm still hesitant to commit to getting this game. 
184, Please have good pitching today. 
185," Oh look, Eaton absolutely failing at a bunt again. What a shocker. "
186," I don't get it. Where are you getting 2,000 miles from and where are the ethnic mom and pop restaurants in Tulsa airports that he should be getting? "
187, Strickland's thrown like 6 innings. Elias hasn't done shit. Hudson's been great but for how long under Davey? Also funny how we desperately need deadline trades to fix the shit bullpen that Rizzo builds every offseason and somehow he gets praise for marginally fixing his fuckups. 
188, I trust you Fedde. Show me dat grit 
189," I love Chili's. It's never amazing, but I've never had a bad meal there. Solid chain. "
190, And someone needs to take bullpen acquisition decision from Rizzo. Dude fucking sucks at building one. 
191, That was the most Nats shit I've ever seen. 
192," At least he wants fair wages for minor leaguers, oh wiat. "
193, That would require foresight or thinking which our dumbass manager doesn't do. 
194, Ironic that the sub that castrates you if you react to a bad game is throwing a shitfit over a reliever having one bad year. 
195," Wow, I disagree hard with a lot of this sub on Matt Grace. Usually I'm the negative one but I think Matt Grace is good, just having a bad year and honestly I think he could bounce back with some rests and probably fewer dry humps because I assume he's one of the biggest victims of those. 

He's been fine when he had to start in spot relief, and most of the times when he has to go long. We kept Solis for far longer and he was terrible outside of one year and Matt Grace is definitely better so all this talk of DFAing him is boggling to me.

I think he's kind of having the same issue Roark had that first Fister year. Roark was constantly bouncing around between spot starts, one-inning relief and long relief and he had a rough year. Likewise, Grace doesn't have much of a defined role and is pretty much sent in there whenever nothing else makes much sense. I feel for him and I hope we don't DFA him. We already DFAed Justin Miller which was just fucking asinine. "
196, MASN should have to pay part of it as part of the settlement. 
197, Eaton and his bunts piss me off so much. 
198," Henley already kills rallies, might as well add ligaments to the rsum. "
199," Legends say that if you smoke a joint, listen to Box of Rain and say his name into a dusty VW van's mirror three times, Jerry Garcia himself will appear in front of you and grant you one request. "
200," So what? Our bullpen is garbage. Absolutely garbage. An ugly guy can bag a hot chick every once in a while too, I'll still take Clooney's chances over him. "
201," I've said it before, but leaving trash relievers like Rodney on the roster for Davey is like leaving a toddler with a bomb detonator with a big, shiny red button.

You know the fucker's gonna slam that button because he's an idiot and can't help himself. It's practically malfeasance by Rizzo.

Of course the obvious solution is fire Davey into the sun like should happen, but since that apparently is not an option Rizzo has to plan around it. "
202," The logic makes sense. Use Rodney in the 8th, and keep Hudson for the 9th to give a break to Doolittle if the Nats take the lead.

Or rather, the logic makes sense if you ignore your eyes and don't know that Rodney is fucking terrible and is honestly stealing innings from someone who might still have a future. "
203, It is literally a blown save. 
204, That runner is coming around to score. Never been more sure of anything. 
205, Good lord Rodney sucks ass. 
206, Game and season. 
207,"  He's really known for keeping the clubhouse together, which Davey can do as well. 

As long as Rizzo is jettisoning dissidents into the ether. "
208," If Rizzo stands on the table and says he gets a carte blanche to hire the next manager on his terms or he goes too, I think so. But he needs to do that. "
209, Who would have thought that only one reliable pitch wasn't a good sign for a closer? Rivero obviously being the exception. 
210," Who is Rizzo's guy, and he hasn't been doing his job for seasons now. Years and years of shit bullpen and shit manager play. "
211, Camels. End of transmission. 
212, Fuck Davey and Rizzo. 
213, Loser fucking team doing loser fucking things. Shocker. 
214, Great job Strasburg. 
215, Because the poster you replied to is an idiot. 
216," By that logic, he's throwing against a lot of guys that probably won't make the roster so it should equalize.

Dude's played shitty, accept it. "
217," Good, I like Cabrera's bat. "
218," Thank you Corbin, thank you Suero, thank you Rizzo, without your efforts today I would have thought today would be worth a damn. Thank you for setting me straight. "
219," He earned that contract 100%, but given his injury situation, it's undoubtedly one of the worst contracts unless he miraculously comes back looking like his old self. "
220, Corbin looks like shit. 
221," Yeah, the difference is the coach doesn't make the decisions unless it's Belichick. Gruden has no idea. This doesn't mean shit. "
222," I'm down if you want. Been Plat 2 Div 4 but I've hit a block where I'm trying to regain consistency in 2s so I'm Gold 2 right now. On Switch and NA East. Mike#9912 if you want to play, no worries if you don't or can't, though. "
223," Considering the pieces of shit-toast the Gibbs II tenure is sandwiched between, pretty good, actually. "
224, Baby needs a GM who can actually build a bullpen. 
225," Yawn. We're marginally better than we were yesterday, if we're even better at all. How the fuck is Sipp still on the roster? "
226," Maybe when dumb playcalling is against the rules and enforced by officials. PI is against the rules. That was absolutely PI. Stop this stupid round of ""b-but the Saints could have played better!"" It's dumb. "
227," He was terrible this year, but this is so incredibly short-sighted. "
228," Oh shit, that's it? Well thanks, GC here I come.

There's so much more that goes into it. Have they been trying ceiling shots before? If so, then yeah, look for it. Does it look like they're setting up for one? Save up boost and drive up the wall if possible, and try to get in an angle they might be shooting at.

But shit, where's my teammate? Is he back or is he still flopping around in the front of the pitch? How do I air roll so I still get there in time, block the shot and minimize any chance of a rebound from the 2nd/3rd?

I don't really have a problem with defending aerials/ceilings, certainly better than I am at pulling them off, but there's a lot that goes into it that you need to think about when you're new to people doing this stuff and trying to get a counter-attack going. "
229," The best is when you just suck ass in a game and your teammate is toxic, and later beat them. I even once had one say, ""Why couldn't you play like this earlier?"" Need to fucking warm up, man, sometimes I suck, chill. "
230," Just piping in, but another habit I've had success with is asking myself constantly, ""How did I get here?""

If I can backtrace my steps like 99% of the time, I'm awake. But sometimes I'm dreaming back in high school and it makes me realize none of it makes any fucking sense and I can't explain why I'm late to this class I had never heard of. "
231," I get the old hag who screams unholy when I have sleep paralysis, wouldn't want to get sucked off by her but I guess I'll try anything once. "
232," I hate being in plat. One game you get people doing this, the next they can barely hit the ball. Makes it hard to adjust. It's part of the game, but still annoying. "
233," I don't feel like that's bad though. Even if you could at that level, why would you defend against ceiling shots like this in Plat? I'm in Plat and I'll play it like a silver 100%. Sometimes you get balled, but you just tip your cap and move on. Most of the times I find they're just barely touching the ball and sending it way off from teammates/the goal. "
234," I watched that five times before I read your comment and was like ""No way he got bumped"", but sure enough. What the fuck, well done OP. "
235," That was quite a bit ago. Kudos to Rizzo for picking him up, despite the Taylor Jordan debacle in getting him to start. But honestly I think that might be more dumb luck or Roark being undervalued due to not really being a prospect at all. "
236, I would love to have this sub if I was a part of the front office or managerial staff and we were underperforming. They excuse everything. Or close to it. 
237, I was talking about developing pitchers in general. 
238," Even if I granted you Voth (I don't, he's barely spent any time in the majors and even still is meh, okay, and not a significant part of our team or path to winning), that's one example. One. That would like me saying Rizzo is shit at developing position players because Michael A. Taylor is trash. "
239, It's easy to do when you have fucking coaches who can develop relievers. We don't. We are shit at scouting relievers and shit at developing them. 
240," Ross has arm talent, but unfortunately we can't do anything for him. Unless a pitcher is good out of the box, whether it be through promotion or trade or FA, we just can't help them anymore.

Long gone are the days of Zimmermanns and Stammens and pitchers actually improving in the majors and making adjustments. You're good or you're not, and if you're not, you can't be helped.

It's fucking disgusting and a shit job by Rizzo. "
241," Option 1 isn't even hindsight, we all know Ross isn't right. If Grace is looking good, stick with him. We don't exactly have much room to breathe. Just another bad Davey decision. "
242," Not even with Todd Coffey would it take 5-10 minutes to do that. And even if by some miracle it did, you can just warm-up earlier. "
243," No fucking shit, I'm agreeing with him, learn to re-read. "
244, No one can explain adequately because it makes no sense to not do that if you aren't willing to burn a pinch-hitter. 
245,"  dumb

No slurs against the mute, please. "
246," Nah, he'll just say the same stupid shit he always does and act like it's a blip and we have all the time in the world. "
247," The worst part about this series is that we could easily be winning this series, but a lot of our moves and strategy from Rizzo and Davey are the R word which is now a no-no and is causing self-inflicted wounds. "
248, Time to give up on Joe Ross. 
249,  
250," Not that anything you said is untrue, it's a very good recent recap of what is wrong with Davey, but what kills me the most about this is that Rizzo is enabling it. He's allowing Davey to do these moves and even shipped out decent relievers to mold the clubhouse to his shit ""strategy"". 

I put strategy in quotes because we saw at the end of the Rockies games even the defenders didn't know what's going on, so I don't think you can call it strategy if it isn't presupposed and deliberate.

We have been winning in spite of him. It's fine if that's the path he wants to go down, but continuing to capitulate to the owners about their managerial choices and moving relievers to keep Davey afloat, this all just looks bad on Rizzo.

He needs to take a stand on managers and relievers to owners, or quit, which he could easily do and get another GM/high-up front office position while simultaneously embarrassing the Lerners, because look at the moves he's made with regards to position players and starters.

He's just utterly clueless or gutless with bullpens and at this point it's Rizzo's charge to stop once and for all. No more Melancon-type band-aids that fix us for a year at most. "
251, She is massive. She's going to be an adorable nightmare. 
252, I would love to hear Madson's unfiltered thoughts on Davey and the bullpen management in his time here. 
253," I think Matt Grace is a decent, ML quality pitcher who's suffering under Davey, to be honest. He wouldn't be the first and won't be the last. "
254, And traded Kintzler. They hated them because they told the truth. 
255, camels.jpg 
256, Leaving bad relievers on the roster with Davey is like leaving a toddler with a loaded gun. You might scrape by but eventually the kid will aim at himself. 
257, I see we're still pretending Rodney is somehow worth pitching. 
258, I'm 1-for-1 introducing people with the Osteoporosis Dance episode of BOTW. 
259, I agree. Roar looked like it would be pretty boring to watch more than a few minutes of after the initial shock fades. 
260, The impression was great. I don't get the hate. I thought he was a good counter-personality to the rest of the guys who are all depressed and insane. Plus it's probably nerve-wracking to watch lion maulings and then record an episode of a show with a misanthropic audience. 
261, I liked the other guy more than McCulkin if I'm being honest. Not that I dislike McCulkin.

264," I've bought both durian and dragonfruit from Global Food in Woodbridge. Can't speak to the others, but if you go there, I imagine they'd have a couple more of those. "
265," Not even close to a pro and I'm still not great at it, but better than I ever thought I'd be at it so I thought I'd give my two cents on this. 

It's weird because you spend so long trying to get good at flying upright that your brain wires to these weird controls, and then they completely reverse when upside down. When I (try to) fly upside down, your best move is to do the opposite of whatever feels natural and it takes a long while to quicken that line of thought. I still don't have it down, but it's getting there.

I recommend taking an air dribble from wall training pack (I use the one by Iowa the most on recommended) and try to air dribble upside down. 

It's miserable, but you eventually start to pick up the idea of where to move your thumbs and how to air roll while upside down. It just takes a while, especially if you're like me and don't have the innate intuitive feel for Rocket League. "
266," I don't, I'm not sure my computer could even run it, I have a 10-year old computer that's slow and getting up there in age. Might try in the future if I can get a more consistent playing schedule and whatnot but for the time being I am comm-less, sorry. "
267," Cool, will probably log off in an hour but hopefully we can play some. If not, no worries and we'll play soon. Because Switch messaging is shit, if I have a long response I'll PM it just FYI. "
268," Oddly, I can't add you with the RocketID thing because you are on Switch as well, but you can through friend codes. If you want to add me, here's mine:

SW-1251-8633-2142 "
269," Rodney imploded, Davey hooked him up to the bomb and set the detonation sequence.

It was bad managing, bad logic and crazy that you're defending it, and that is that. "
270," I'm not sure it's even logic. It's the equivalent of ""If we aren't winning the World Series, might as well lose in the first round"". Doolittle doesn't guarantee the win, but he gives a better chance. Why would you not maximize your chances (against your biggest rival) when the season is quickly winding down and you have a golden chance to cut the lead?

It's honestly indefensible. "
271," Don't ever tell me Davey isn't a bad manager again.

Yes, Rizzo is a complete dumbass with bullpens and should have been able to build a solid one by now, no doubt. But I'm confused as to what Doolittle's purpose is if it isn't get the top of the lineup out with the game on the line. And if you're going to sit him for the beginning of the inning for whatever reason, be it rest or whatever, at least stick with it and don't force him to risk injury by having him warm up by trying to throw 100 warmup pitches in 100 seconds.

For all the ""forward thinking"" we heard about Davey having, he sure is a slave to tradition. "
272," Matt Williams at least had traceable logic, even if it was bad logic. Lost the lockeroom too, but I don't think Davey ever had it. I know this sub disagrees but I don't give a shit, I would take Matt over Martinez. "
273, Bad bullpen is bad. 
274," Lol I wasn't trying to imply your story wasn't adding up, it's just unusual because even when I watch people stream or something it's pretty common to see solo 3s a lower rank than regular.

Also I don't give a shit about your rank or finding someone ""equal"" so don't worry about that. As long as you're cool and trying I'm down to play. "
275," It's odd to me that you're a whole rank higher in Solo Standard. I've had brief moments where it's like that for me but it quickly corrects itself and now I can't seem to win in Solo 3s for some reason. I have some sort of mental block or am too ballchasey/not ballchasey enough. 

I'd be happy to play with you sometime. Currently Plat 2 in 3s and Gold 3 in 2s but I'm very inconsistent in playing, both in skill and in availability to play. As long as you're non-toxic because I'm sick of that and for some reason Switch players especially seem toxic around our ranks. 

I try to work on dribbles, air dribbles, back wall clears and all that fun stuff I'm not great at so I just want to forewarn that there will be times I'll hang you out to dry, but not for lack of effort and I always try to make it up. 

Just want to improve so if we hit a skid it's not a huge deal to me. If you or anyone else is interested, my tag is Mike#9912. "
276," Ah, that would make sense. "
277," Did I mishear the clue for the question about the only letter not used in a State Capital? Because the answer was supposedly Q but I can't find a ""Z"" in any of the capitals either. "
278," Hey sorry man, I'm about to fall asleep. Definitely add me though and we can do some games sometime soon. Have a nice night. "
279," Cool, should be up for a couple more hours. Text chat on Switch is very slow so if I have a long one I'll pop it in here in a DM. "
280," Switch player willing to play if you would like. I don't have a mic or anything, but I'm chill. Been as high as Plat 2 Div 4 but feeling pretty gold right now due to infrequent play. Unranked or ranked is cool. Mike#9912 if you are interested. "
281," Even though that run was scored, I think that was a bad send. "
282," [I'm rich.](https://i.imgur.com/DJFBZj9.png)

I always wondered why they stopped sending these, this must have been the reason why. "
283," Implying Adams or Kendrick couldn't have had a good night with the bat. I'm curious if they've released any more Austin Powers movies in your timeline, I'm dying for another and I think Mike Myers needs a comeback. "
284," Not really. Not that Martinez is good at managing it, but our bullpen would still be shit without him, just slightly less so. And you could dismiss him at any moment if you wanted to. This is mostly Rizzo. "
285, I don't know why teams don't run on him more often but I am thankful for it. 
286," Half this sub could have thrown to the catcher without pulling him off home plate. Batting will come and go, but there is no excuse for that lollipop. "
287," ""He's our first baseman."" "
288, Venters is very ungood. I feel bad that he's had bad injury luck but we really should do better than him. 
289," I wish I had advice to give, I just want to say I'm sorry. I'm not being hyperbolic when I say I don't think I could happily live without those foods. "
290, I was getting Mexican food so no idea what happened but no complaints. 
291, I hope that comment felt better writing it than it did reading it. And not because I'm offended. 
292," You'd be correct if we weren't talking about the Nationals who are mongoloids when it comes to running the bases. Don't worry, you'll pick it up. "
293," Agreed, he could have easily been in 2nd without any trouble, completely superfluous out and play. "
294," Why the fuck are 21-year-olds still learning one of the most basic things about baseball at the highest level, F.P.? That shouldn't happen at age 16, let alone in the MLB. "
295, I see Robles graduated Magna Cum Laude in the Nationals School of Retarded Baserunning. Fucking idiot. 
296," I'd be down as long as you're non-toxic, which I'm assuming you are if you're asking here. I can't stand ""Nice shot!""s and ""What a Save!""s regardless of team. I'm plat3div1 in 3s, g2d3 in 2s. Used to be plat2d4 in 2s but I've hit a rut. 

If you're cool with that though, hit me up at Mike#9912. "
297," So the shipping out of relievers was cohesive clubhouse? You're acting like Matt Williams had a bullpen juggernaut in waning Clippard (bless him though), Storen the worst choker in Nats history, Soriano, and the rest of those castoffs. "
298," So the only difference between Davey and Matt is Rizzo shipping out relievers (who were actually good for us and have been solid since leaving)? And this somehow makes Davey better how? All that says is Rizzo is an idiot too.

The ""being in over your head"" shit can be said of Matt Williams too and can't be qualified in either way. It's a worthless explanation. "
299," In regards to the bullpen, which was the meat of my comment? Yes, shit might be too kind for what Rizzo's done there. "
300," I've been watching since Riggleman, and I can safely say that Davey Martinez is the worst manager we've had in that time frame.

That's not to absolve Rizzo; he's done a shitty job for like 5 years straight, but no one knows how to push the wrong buttons and then smash the entire console with a bat like Davey.

Even Matt Williams, for the rigid retard he's regarded as, at least had consistent trains of thought I could track, even if they were bad or full of misplaced faith (""he's our closer"").

Davey is just a joke. He throws shit at the wall to see what sticks, which isn't always bad, but he has absolutely no regard for the long-term effects of two innings from now, let alone two weeks from now.

What a fucker. "
301, Clout  Winning 
302, Thank God we have Zimmerman back for...??? 
303," That's it, they allow us by not being historically shitty. How many games have they been a strength in? I could count on two hands, absolute max.

The reason for the hostreak is our 1-3 and we have good young hitters. And we've been playing poor teams like the Marlins who are tanking. But when those parts falter we're nothing. "
304," And mostly against a bunch of shitty teams too. Great, we're on a streak, but we're not beating any of the playoff contenders like this. "

332, Turner is just so talented yet so underwhelming. 
333," It's basically a turf war game. Players have weapons to ""paint"" the maps with the ink color of their team. There's a variety of ways and weapons to do it, but the winner of each match is the team that paints/covers more of the map than the other. "

335, That was the body and swing of every dad in the batting cages showing their kid (who doesn't give a shit about baseball) how it's done.

And if they did, they would be one of the most coveted pitchers in the league. "
337, Why didn't we pick any one tonight? 
338," I'd be down to play for an hour-ish. I'm on Switch, plat 2 in 3s and plat 1 in 2s, currently shaking off rust from a few days off.

Don't know if I can teach much especially since I don't have voice chat, but I am definitely patient and don't sarcastic quick chat anyone.

Source? This sounds like something that could be generally true but people have ended up in jail for years for dumb shit so I'm not going to take anything at face value.

This has nothing to do with money and technicalities. 

I mean, it does though. The evidence is apparently impermissible because the police didn't do warrants properly or something. That's a technicality in the vernacular sense.

You agree that there is enough evidence to find you guilty - you take a class, pay a small fine and it gets removed from your record. Just like almost every misdemeanor.

This sounds like some sort of plea agreement, which is totally different than getting evidence dismissed. This is based off a quick read and not a whole lot of law knowledge so take it with a soy sauce's bottle worth of salt, but that totally sounds like a different circumstance. "

But in seriousness, yes. Not enough to be unplayable, but I will just glitch for a few seconds every couple games and this is on Switch. It's not the bad rubberbanding you get with the symbols, but it is annoying and leads to weird shit happening for me. "
387, I don't know what to tell you. It gives me the option to play sound with it. But then again I can see about four frames in every v.reddit link here so my shit might be all fucked up. 
388," That's okay, people can then just whip out the handy ""it's early"" excuse, because we know games don't count until August. "
389, So we're going to win 100% of our games as long as we can allow one or fewer runs each game. Awesome. 
390, Bottom right corner there should be a muted speaker button. 
391," I don't know how Hellickson can look the manager in the eyes. I know what the numbers say about TTttO, but he was great tonight and has fucking 9 Ks. Why be on a team that has so little regard for you? "

393," Poor Doolittle, always coming in to clean up other relievers messes and always has no room for error. "
394, It begins. 
395, Bottom of the 9th three walk no-run inning incoming. Two strikeouts and a pickoff. Book it. 
396, [Rare angle of Nats batter with men on base](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/008/342/ihave.jpg) 
397," I fully expect one of the Nats to walk up to bat, put his forehead on bat, spin around in a circle like you would for a pinata, and rip a swing right into Max's knees because that's the only way he could get more fucked by the team tonight. "
398, Imagine having to scratch and claw just to put up two runs against Wainwright in 2019. 
399, Fedde's done a good job of calming the Padres down and for that I am thankful. 
400," Exactly. At this point, keep all the young relievers who have shown flashes in the majors, like Miller, Suero, etc. Then hope they can fix their shit and get good experience. We have too many holes to try to fix for this season. "
401," I'm already writing this season off, but with Robles how he's looked, Soto, Turner, and Rendon I'm not pessimistic about our chances in the future. Throw in Scherzer, Corbin, Kieboom, Difo, our two catchers, other Kieboom, we have some nice pieces.

But it will all be for naught if our cueball GM doesn't lock up Rendon and doesn't address how he builds bullpens. Secure our fucking future, Rizzo. "
402, There are no words. 
403, This season is ass. 
404," ""Plantar Fascitis"" "
405," I was gone (physically, not mentally, I've been mentally gone for a while) after posting that comment so thank you.

Let's think about all the good relievers we've had in the past 8ish years. How many of them were home grown vs. how many were good in the major leagues before we traded for them?

Stammen, Storen for one year, Clippard, is there anyone else that came up with us before being good? Melancon, Doolittle, Madson, Kintzler, Soriano, Papelbon, Blevins, Rzepczynsk. All from the second were major parts of our bullpen and established MLers before being acquired by us.

We've been skating on a good rotation and a good lineup and doing almost no developing of relievers seriously. Why the fuck is that the case. "
406," Final Destination, Rendons only, no Daveys. "
407," Rizzo needs to go into his office tonight, and take every single scouting report, every single note, every single thing relating to relief pitchers he has and burn them. Fucking burn them.

Because year in, year out we have this issue. Sure we could make trades and probably get a few decent guys, but what's the end game there? Outside of Doolittle NO ONE is getting it done. Constantly trading for relievers hemorrhages away prospects and they're band-aids. And honestly, with the offense looking the way it is, do we really want to try just for *maybe* playoffs?

Why can every team except us bring up relievers from the minors and do well? We can bring up guys with talent, where they have flashes but ultimately don't work, and then as a bonus, a lot of them go elsewhere and look refined.

Rizzo needs to hire an outside expert and give them carte blanche for everything relating to relievers. Let him choose whatever scouts, coaches and whatever he needs and listen to his advice on relievers. 

Because it's no longer early in his tenure, we can safely say Rizzo has no idea what he's doing there. Not a damn clue. "
408, I'm not ready to give up on Suero. He looked good last year. Overall though yeah this is a joke. 
409, Can't put up runs and the bullpen eventually seizes. Quelle surprise. 
410, Imagine how good Stammen would look in a Nats uniform. 
411," There are no ""hot takes"" when you're playing like we are, only hard-to-takes. And the fact is we aren't that good, this is not a playoff team.

Everyone knows about the bullpen, where Rizzo needs to throw out every strategy and though he's had about developing relievers because he clearly doesn't know shit about them, but the lineup.

2B and 1B are fucking awful. And one is supposed to be a prime offensive position, and we have almost $30MM locked up in dead weight on the right side of our infield.

gg no reezo "
412, Then it fits right in on this sub. 
413, That's why it was so hard to read. 
414," I really hope it's not Difo like people are saying that he's replacing. If he's replacing anyone it should be Dozier, but I know it won't happen. "
415, There's a lot of blame to go around for the players. It's not like Kuznetsov wasn't ass most of this series either. 
416," * Constantly ice the puck so you're in the defensive zone

* Your only zone entries are a predictable slingshot and dump and chase play

* Refuse to shoot and look for perfect 5-man passing plays in front of the net

* Drag your feet like it's not the playoffs

I'm shocked they didn't win the series. Bang up job by Reirden and the Caps. "
417," Who would have thought that when you actually fucking shoot, good things can happen. "
418, What the fuck is wrong with the Caps. Can't sustain offensive pressure at all and absolutely refuse to shoot. 
419," Another gift there, that was a delay I'm pretty sure. "
420, 20 minute OTs until someone scores. 
421, Hagelin is so lucky he didn't get called for that absolutely retarded bump on Mrazek. 
422, Sad how it looks like Carolina's been on a power play most of the OT. 
423, They look like they're playing game 41/82 and are giving up possession like it's nothing. 
424," Carlson on the ice for all three goals. Good going, John. "
425, Apparently leaking blood isn't enough for a penalty either. 
426, Holy fuck our PP sucks. We deserve to get booted tonight. 
427," Ah yes, the ballad of Henry Rodriguez, never thought I'd hear it again. "
428," Because the dumbass GM gave him a $7MM major league deal. He literally can't go without being DFAed, which he should be, but you know "
429, If Rosenthal swam in the ocean he would take first place as the most giant collection of floating garbage on Earth. 
430," Three men on, none out. They have us right where they want us. "
431," Don't worry, we'll get a bullshit PP with 1:30 left as though that makes up for that call. "
432, Screwjob if that stands. 
433," The worst part about this is we look like we don't even give a shit half the time in Carolina. It'd be fine if we were a young team and obviously outmatched, but this is just lame. "
434," If that was embellishment, Orlov is a Daniel Day Lewis-esque method actor. "
435, Giving the puck to Orpik to control in the defense? That's not even a good idea against a high school travel team. 
436," BREAKING: Reirden is thinking about asking the guys to ""come on"" and ""step it up"" after unbelievably terrible power play. "
437," Even if washed out, that was a bad play by Holtby. "
438," \Sit on Holtby's face presumably so he can eat the booty

\Give up goal

It was so well-thought out too. "
439, Imagine having a decade to draft talent and develop players and this is the bullpen you come up with. 
440, Natinals defense. 
441, Guy on 3rd with less than two outs. Our kryptonite. 
442, You'd have to have a Chaos Control mechanic which would be the coolest part of Shadow. Probably wouldn't be too hard either what with Bayonetta having something similar. 
443," You're gonna get Silver and you're going to like it mister.

But real talk Eggman would disappoint me too. If it's not Tails or Knuckles, eh, I just kind of don't give a shit. Would rather give that development effort to someone else instead of Pingas Man. "
444, Galaxy Brain: Probably no chance of Tails DLC character even if there are more fighter passes. =( 
445," I don't know, strikes me as an odd random thing to show off in a stage builder where you can basically make anything. Why a witch in April? 

It's tinfoil-y for sure, but with all the rumors about Xbox and Nintendo teaming up I don't think it's out of the question to be a hint. "
446," We could play that game back and forth with all the negatives of which there are far more for this team right now. Until you get extra wins for those things you mentioned, who cares. "
447," Our relievers don't even have control over their saliva, let alone their pitches. "
448, They've never look combobulated enough to look the opposite. 
449," They've been doing it for years now, why fix what's broken? "
450, I can't imagine how many homers Strasburg will be serving up when we actually get to the warm months. 
451, Jeff Samardzija 
452, Lol if you think there was anything wrong or dirty about that fight. 
453," Geoff, you ever been to New Orleans? "
454," Shitting on Max's effort, walking a guy 0-2 and getting drilled for a likely loss. 

Yep, this is definitely Nats baseball. "
455, Two terrible goals by Holtby. 
456," Had we have kept him, he probably would still suck. "
457," Ahh, that season was magical. Times were so simpler then. You let a starter ball out, had LaRoche hit a clutch hit, and had Clippard and Storen lock it down. And then life got in the way. "
458, One day Rizzo will make a good bullpen out of the gate by sheer accident. I just hope I live to see that day. 
459," He's doing a nightly Make-A-Wish project to pitch with has-beens and never-beens this year, so yeah, just us. "
460," ""We got a lot of work to do, we played hard, it just wasn't there tonight. Corbin pitched great but we couldn't score enough and the other team made a few more plays.""

461, Bad strategy then. 
462," Someone replace that ""I'm retarded"" gif from Quantum Leap I think it is with Martinez's face. "
463," Oh wow, it's almost like that bunt was a terrible fucking decision. hoodathunk "
464, Did it though? I'd rather have all three swinging than that. 
465," \Robles trying to bunt with Adams on the bases

466, I think Rendon's going to get his well-deserved all-star status this year. 
467," Pretty happy with Corbin so far, but not going to lie, I want Robbie Ray back too just to have all the strikeouts. All the strikeouts. "
468," ""Joking""? I know not what that word means. "
469," I don't know, lead still might be a bit thin for a Rosenthal outing. It needs to be at least... three times this big "
470," Why not, I mean eventually the runners gotta get lazy and run out of the baseline or pass each other. "
471," t. Mets, Marlins, Braves and Phillies 2012 - 2017

472," In his defense, I mean how is Strasburg supposed to pitch in weather over 50 degrees? That's halfway to 100, people **sweat** in that kind of weather. "
473," No, because he has the endurance of Dollar Store utensils and the mentality of an opossum. That's why he extended. "

476," Yes, I'm sorry to say I don't think that's possible. You can hit the OK button on a Nats game slot, and record all series, but that might record all games on the channel and might not get it when it's on the other MASN channel. Unfortunately you'll have to be regular about recording games. "
477," What /u/SotoSato said is pretty spot on. You pay more with Fios but you get what you pay for compared to Comcast, in my opinion.  "
478," If it were me, ideally you would have built a good enough ballclub that you can carry those types of players while they learn and adjust. 

I wouldn't send him down, what's done is done. I just think it's weird to put so much on his plate with this team being the way it is and this division so tough. I would keep him up, but I'm not expecting to compete that long either.  "
479," What, in terms of GM? How the fuck should I know, I'm not an owner interviewing prospective GMs, wining and dining them to get their insights and calling their employers for background to their abilities.  "
480," I didn't delete any comment. I'm getting constantly locked out of my account though and having to re-sign in, might have something with that. But the comment claymatthews responded to isn't my comment.  "
481," Why can't I say he needs to be sent down but not declare him permanently a shit player? That's not contradictory at all. He's been rough so far and I'm fine with him starting, but if we're going to compete and he's playing like this we don't really have the leeway to carry him. It's seemingly contradictory to both develop him at this point and compete.

Also let's be real, Goodwin has basically one year of MLB experience on which to draw, MAT has years of failure. How that fucking alien-headed Desmond clone has lasted this long, I'll never know. But I would expect a guy with that much more experience to be equal (or you know, surpass) a guy like Goodwin who's had one real year.  "
482,"  Look where this team was when he took over and how we've done since. The record speaks for itself.

Literally the first sentence of my post. We were an ""expansion"" (you get what I mean) franchise feeling itself out. Not surprising we were shit early and we've gotten to ""not a laughing stock"" status under him.

That's great, but no playoff series wins. Perennially shit bullpen in an age where bullpens matter more. Same stuff year after year.

I don't give a fuck about not being a joke anymore, which we've accomplished in part due to Rizzo, I care about actually improving and mattering. I don't see how Rizzo is taking us to that next level. "
483," No it didn't. There were a fair number of people calling out the bullpen for the unproven/risky shit it was before the season. If you had earmuffs on and only followed this sub's hype train, sure.  "
484,"  I wouldn't call Rizzo ""pure fucking garbage"".

I mean, that's definitely hyperbole on my part but I would expect a GM with ten years' tenure and a high payroll to have misses as well as hits. So he's gotten a few hits, but so what? I've run out of patience. Where is the improvement? I could stick random /r/nationals in his position for 10 years and I'd bet they have a few hits as well.  "
485," If I said Robles was a shit player with shit defense based off what we've seen, you'd laugh at me and deservably so. Because it's been what, 7 games? Small sample size.

It's been a small sample size for Goodwin as well. Who didn't get much opportunity because he was behind guys like Eaton and MAT who haven't done jack shit for us. (inb4 game 4 MAT I mean on a consistent or long-term basis) "
486," JUST  BECAUSE  WE'VE  HAD  SHIT  GMs  BEFORE  HIM  DOESN'T  MAKE  RIZZO  GOOD 

Rizzo is such pure fucking garbage. You think he would make a bullpen good once at season's beginning just by accident in his time here. Fuck that bald-headed mafia boss-in-training.  "
487, Eckschckuse me shir but your factsh were shlightly off so your posht was invalid 
488, So what? Shoot your best shot. I'd rather have Doolittle+PH (or Doolittle hitting for himself) than literally any other reliever in this pen. 
489," So our enlightened, new-age manager refuses to bring in Doolittle unless he has a lead.  "
490," Would they? Because they (who actually pitched for us) looked pretty bad at the ML level. Which would fall on the coaches.

Which would then fall on Rizzo, ultimately. 

TL;DR: Fuck Rizzo  "
491, Imagine how good we would be if Rizzo actually could evaluate relievers and we weren't constantly trading picks for them every trade deadline.  
492," My 100 games referred to Robles but I think you're talking about Eaton again.

Who gives a shit? **115 plates appearances** That's all you need to know. That's it.  "
493," Even if we took your statement as true, he's never healthy so it's a moot point. The fucking idiot can't even do everyday stuff without injuring himself.  "
494, Glover is shit too.  
495, Rizzo Fails to Build a Bullpen: Season 463 
496," I'm more impressed he's appeared in 120 games, I didn't think that he had that many in him for us, what with him having one leg and all. "
497," Funny how small sample size doesn't apply to good opinions. 

We'll see how he is 100 games from now before we get excited. "
498, Players hope to be as strong as Difo is one day.  
499, To whom are you referring? Eaton?  
500, I would be happy for Eaton to be an almost everyday starter for us but he's been dead weight. Robles hasn't done jack shit and your guy should honestly probably go down. But who am I to get in the way of dumb opinions.  
501, Guide - Go to 577 or 579 whichever the Nats are on - Scroll to the time slot/program slot the Nats will play during - That record button on the bottom right. Can provide pics if necessary. 
502," As opposed to Michael A. Taylor, who is shit, Adam Eaton who is always injured and has been not great when healthy, Robles who has done nothing, Harper always injured/meh, Stevenson (shit) and whomever else you want to bring up.  "
503," Goodwin had a good eye at the plate for a rookie, still not sure what the fuck Rizzo was thinking with that move.  "
504," Yeah, I'm not sure why he gets as much hate as he does on this sub, but this sub also declared Robles a star before he did anything worth a shit so I don't take the sub's reaction too seriously. Idiots aplenty here.  "
505, That was a good at-bat and try by Difo. I'm sad about Turner as well as you are but I'm glad we have a good back-up in Difo unlike prior years where we'd be stuck with people like Trashspinosa.  
506, Thank you so much for all the answers and guidance.  
507," That makes a lot more sense to me now.

It's not a Microsoft thing, it's a standard PC thing.  

So I don't actually work with Linux, Mac or anything else, but I'm curious, is that the default for those type of systems too? I know you *can* boot from an outside source, but are other OSes designed the same way? 

And a final line of questioning for tonight: I had a task recently where I had to rename some files in order to do something and I accomplished this through Hiren's. However, instead of renaming file X, I almost renamed a registry file for X that (conceivably) could have screwed up that file permanently.

Assuming I did rename the wrong file, would the device have forever been fucked? Or could I have shut it down and restarted with Hiren's and renamed it back? I guess what I'm asking is, was X's file's and registry keys completely contained to the hard drive of the device or was it unique to the ""session"" of Hiren I had started?

I hope that made sense. I feel like I'm almost learning a new language. "
508," How does it bypass? It's not an official Microsoft product, correct? Is this special to Hiren or is it a natural thing Microsoft intended for any ""boot from CD/flash/drive""?

If I get too into the weeds by the way, feel free to just tell me to fuck off and that that's just how it works.

No problem on the nitpicking, I need to learn this sort of thing.  "
509," So now you have me second guessing and wondering what I'm asking as well. This may be total Windows n00bery 101 stuff. 

So say your hard drive is failing and you can't get your computer to start up at all unless you use Hirens or something similar. How/why can Hirens run ""normally"" and do things that (I assume) require hard drive memory and functions? Isn't it all a huge vulnerability too that this disc can boot up a computer and do all these commands? Why/how does it get these sort of privileges?

Maybe I'm misunderstanding what Hirens does in asking this, in which case I apologize.  "
510," We use Hiren occasionally at my job, for things such as imaging, but I'm not sure how or why it works.

I don't want too nitty gritty, because I haven't used Windows prior to this for 10+ years and am still getting into the swing of it. 

But if anyone could explain this apparently magic disk I would be appreciative. Is things such as imaging and what not possible without it? How much more arduous is the process without it?

Thanks in advance. "
511," I feel bad for Anna and Alex, they went up against a gorilla wearing sockem boppers tonight. 

I'm not sure I've seen anyone so calmly dominate.  "

513, It's going to be hard to blow this opportunity but I have faith we can do it.  
514," According to the multiverse theory, there exists at least one universe where we're winning this game.

And I gotta say, I don't believe that for a second. This team is that bad.  "

Great bullpen Rizzo! "
522," He was great his first year, Dusty gave him almost no time to warm up as usual before throwing him in the game in the NLDS, he got injured and turned to shit. That's on Dusty.  "
523," *[spins wheel]*

~~Rizzo~~ ~~Davey~~ ~~Riggleman~~ ~~Paul Walker~~ uh... Karl Rove? "
524," A lot of people here complain about my ""rants"" here, which is to some degree, fair. I don't put too much thought into my posts.

But my usual posts aren't rants, just pessimistic observations and opinions on games. If you all want a rant, here's one. What's that, you don't want one? Too fucking bad, you're getting one any way.

What the fuck is wrong with this team? Every year, same shit. Garbage bullpen duct-taped together until the deadline. Terrible bullpen exacerbated by a terrible manager who can't make decisions that would keep a McDonald's afloat. Sporadic offense that routinely kills themselves in innings because they can't run the fucking bases to run their lives.

Injured team. Always a fucking injured team, it doesn't matter how good the team is if they can't stay on the field. Coming up small in big moments. 

And every fucking year it's ""fine"", there's still $totalGames - $gamesPlayed games left. When are we going to take early season seriously? You don't have to panic early and make the first move you can if you're Rizzo, but when are we actually going to acknowledge and fix these mistakes before it's crunch time?

How about a fucking 1st basemen that can actually throw and hit? I'd settle for one of the two at this point because we keep prodding in with the same broke-ass horse and backup donkeys, and then wonder why we can't draw the carriages. 

Don't even mention the 3-RBI double, who gives a shit. That game was over before the 9th inning started. Without looking it up, I'm sure the win probability of 6 down with one out left, even with the bases loaded, is incredibly small.

Where is the improvement they talk about every offseason that we never see?

I actually can't complain about Davey today, which means wave goodbye to today because it'll come around again in 76 years like Hailey's Comet. 

And now we have a tough division for the first time in years. Honestly, fuck this team, fuck the management and fuck anyone saying the shit we are seeing day-to-day is not what we are actually seeing.

Every fucking season. It doesn't matter how ""early"" it is or how many games are left when we're seeing the same shit we've always seen, in games that actually count, against a beefed up division now.

Have a good one, see you all tomorrow for probably more garbage play.  "
525, At least Kelley was good before Dusty broke him.  
526, Thanks I hate him.  
527," Still one out with three runs deficit after bases clearing. If you ever thought that was in doubt, you are modest or foolish. "
528, Not really.  
529," Has to? There's no accountability with the Nats. Turner gets punished for shit Harper doesn't. One guy getting mad at giving up a homer gets thrown off the team when others don't. Players can do the same shit every year and get paid well for it.

Why should he change when nothing about his environment dictates he has to? "
530," It's because we haven't created a losing tradition like the other D.C. teams yet. Everything has been abysmal teams with no shot, division wins and ""unlucky"" NLDS exits. 

They weren't talking about the Redskins struggling 1992 the way they are now. It takes time. 

Hopefully we don't reach that point but it's not out of the question. "
531," It was once heresy to say the Sun revolved the Earth.

Rizzo does a lot of good things and we have some terrible GMs to compare him to during his tenure, even now (Allen, Grunfeld), but he has never been able to build a contending bullpen. It's not heresy, it's fact.   "
532, I too am down with the thiccness.  
533," Best non-meme post I've read on here in a long time.

Our problems are the same they've always been since 2013. "
534," Any number over 0 that isn't 0 is infinity

I thought that was undefined because there's no denominator which is different from infinite.  "
535," How does it make sense. 

What the fuck else is Spring Training for? How many players actually win jobs to make an MLB roster in a given year? For the most part it's set. It's not NFL preseason.

Catchers and pitchers report early for a reason. We knew Suzuki would be on the team. We knew Rosenthal would be on the team. 

In what fantasy world does it make sense that Rosenthal looks like this is his first time pitching or first time throwing to Suzuki? "
536," Chlorine gas which is toxic. Please never mix them, unless you are me and searching for an escape from D.C. sports.  "
537, Rizzo and bullpens are like bleach and vinegar.  
538," If Rosenthal was such a good get, he wouldn't have been jettisoned by his former team.

He has flashes of brilliance, but so did Henry Rodriguez.  Anyone who thought he was more than ""eh"" was just dumb as shit. "
539," Technically he doesn't have an ERA because he hasn't recorded an out. 

So, possible bright side? "
540," No, no, it's the losing. The losing or the fact this was all foreseeable and/or avoidable.  "
541, I remember people thinking Rosenthal was some huge get for the bullpen.  
542,"  They're going to do what makes them the most money in the end. 

Not necessarily, they'll probably do what they think will *probably* make more money for them in the end. But companies make baffling decisions all the time.

I just doubt people who love Rayman enough to buy a platform fighter would buy just one over the other unless they're cash-strapped. I doubt that they would choose Brawlhalla over Smash in terms of exposure. And also doubt that Brawlhalla is big enough for them that they would reject the 12 million plus people who play Smash. Because even if you don't buy the pass or Rayman initially, you'll still probably run into him on Online which I bet most people play. 

I don't know, man. I hope Rayman gets in eventually but shit happens. I just hope it isn't weird business decisions that is stopping Nintendo/Ubisoft from him possibly joining because it doesn't make sense to me, as dumb as I might be. "
543," Yeah, it was a tough play. He should have made it, but I'm not too angry that he didn't make it. We've done far worse in this game even, and luckily we didn't let up a run for it. 

With perspective of that it's Zimmerman who can hardly throw at this point. it was a good play and close. Obviously you want better but it could have been a lot worse.  "
544, Let's not go that far.  
545, Guardedly encouraged by our first Sipp outing. Good on him for getting 3. 
546, Danke schon. 
547, Muchos gracias. 
548," I'll be the first to shit on Zimmerman but that wasn't really his fault. He could've made a faster, better throw if he didn't have a busted shoulder but that wasn't a terrible throw and still a play Turner should have held onto.

Unfortunate.  "
549, Merci beaucoup.  
550," Anyone know where/if Asdrubal Cabrera is playing these days? I could Google but I'm a lazy bastard.

I loved Cabrera for the nicknames and contact he made, wondering if we'll see him this year.  "
551," Suzuki's first stint with us is enough to make comparing him to Wieters an insult. He wasn't amazing, but he was far, far, FAR better than that shitbag Matt.

I'm sure he's a good dude, but Wieters was worse than garbage for us.  "
552," I apologize because I've heard this argument before but I don't buy it. 

Rayman in Brawlhalla might entice more people to buy Brawlhalla who are already Rayman fans, but if we're thinking $$$ and business, why would they then turn down Smash if they were offered? 

More people learning about Rayman would presumably generate more attention in Rayman and his games, which would lead to more sales for future titles and interest. What's going to add more interest, adding him to just one title, or adding him to Brawlhalla **and** Smash?

It might leech a few Brawlhalla sales away, but it might not, and either way it gives a greater audience more exposure to Rayman and future titles of his, which I assume Ubisoft still will do. Which then can, in turn, create more Rayman fans who will buy stuff with him in it (like Brawlhalla). "
553," Soto is still at least one year away from arbitration unless he's on track for Super 2 status and I missed it.

It's a lot easier to turn down a long-term deal when you're a year away like Rendon and already have enough to live a comfortable life than when you're Soto and still earning the minimum. 

They **need** to try to extend Soto if they think he's the player we think he is. He might reject, but to not offer and start negotiations would be silly. It would set him up for life and set the Nats up for a great player under long-term, discounted team control. 

Lock him the fuck up, make every effort.  "
554," To be fair, I'm pretty sure they've said these kind of things in the past before. If you're a veteran Nats fan and didn't expect them to muck this shit up, it's partially on you. 

When the Nats are on, no opposing team can beat them. When the Nats are off, no opposing team can help them. "
555, wE wOrKeD oN tHe FuNdAmEnTaLs 
556, That fake Rayman leak video got me too. I was so hyped.  
557," I think that's a big factor as well. 

It surprises me that Crash Bandicoot (who I loved playing as a kid and would be fine with in Smash as well) is sort of low-key popular in Japan and Rayman is not. I get different games and mechanics and whatnot, but I don't know, Rayman always struck me as that cartoony kind of character that would find success in Japan. "
558, The amount of times I've heard that. 
559," Moments of greatness? Sure. Someone irreplaceable and sanctimonious to even try to upgrade? Not in the least. His best qualities at this point are nostalgia and fan respect, which aren't exactly what you want from a position supposed to be a big bat in your lineup hitting near the middle.  "
560," ^^^

If we could combine the two somehow we'd be golden.  "
561," We shall suffer together, brother/brotheress. I'm honestly shocked that he's not in already but disappointment is nothing new. I don't think he'll be DLC Pack 1 so I'm hoping for at least two at this point. At least I have K. Rool... "
562, But Murphy was also a key hitter. Let's see if we get vintage Dozier or new Dozier before we start throwing shit at a good former Nat.  
563," I mean, yes, I shouldn't say it was impossible, but it would have been a super hard play and if he misses that's 3 bags or more. 

There's enough to ding him on so far, I'm not going to count that against him.  "
564," Doolittle is still good, I assume. Other than that, eh... "
565, He had no chance at that particular play.  
566, $175MM. 
567," I mean this was expected, but yeah.  "
568, I'm talking about in his career. 
569," One N in Zimmerman, Zimmermann was the pitcher.  "
570, You say that like last season was a good one.  
571," Well, at the least I'm slightly encouraged by that Rendon double. Seems like he's been a slow starter but we kind of really need him to assert himself this season, there's not as much wiggle room from the schedule or rest of the lineup.  "
572, And I almost remembered you. 
573," Most MLB players hustle, Espinosa hustled, it doesn't stop them from being dumped on or ending up as shitty players.

Sure, he gets some leeway for this being his first ""real"" MLB action basically, but this is still awful play from him. Where was this ""chill"" narrative when everyone was sucking his dick without him doing anything on an MLB field?  "
574, 4th place here we come.  
575," I still like Quickplay. I understand the complaints about it, but I like the unpredictability of it all even though I'm usually bodied. My only real big complaint is that 1 out of every 10 or so matches is ungodly slow and laggy. 

The GSP is weird but I don't really care about trying to get to Elite Smash, and while I'd like the option of stricter QP parameters and think the mode could be better, I still enjoy it and usually play it when on.  "
576," I just want playable Rayman. I don't think it's likely at this point, but... pls "
577," Apparently the next Persona info dump is April 24th so it's probably going off that. Might be true, might not, but would fit in with the ""end of April"" statement from the last direct.

578, You didn't explain how points were awarded so I wasn't quite sure of how I would ideally allocate.  
579,"  Mostly related to if there was a tip and if they left it before, after, or both.

Before what? Checking out? How would you know it wasn't just for cleaning up the room or room service? "
580, He needs a bunch of Internet posters to tell him that it's only one game and that things magically change because the clock turns. 
581," So Davey still has no concept of foresight or not ""dry humping"", we still can't do shit against deGrom, and for all the offseason talk of working on the little things, sure didn't take long for a dumbass mistake to show up. Bullpen still unclutch.

We're more solid at catcher, but other than that, looks like the same shit to me.  "
582," This is how I feel about Person of Interest. Most people love the overarching plot much more, and while it's still great, I prefer the early ""case of the week"" episodes.  "
583," Thanks for the heads up, enjoy the family time! "
584," That's weird, I wasn't actually on yesterday/today. I never completely exit the game but the console's been asleep since Saturday so I didn't think it would actually show me as online after all that time.

I apologize, I haven't been ignoring you I promise. I'll be sure to actually exit out now when not on so I don't give people that impression. It's hard for me to play too much during weekdays but I'll try to be on at some point today, somewhere in the 5-9 PM EST region. Don't worry if you can't though, I'm sure you've got a lot going on too. 

Super sorry about that.  "
585," From what I read on Smashboards, there were 7 DLC slots put in 4 and all were used. 

Don't know for sure myself, but take that how you will.  "
586," Sakurai had said he considered Alucard as the Castlevania rep, not instead of Richter. Alucard would have played a lot differently (see: his assist moveset) and would have taken more time to develop. It's more a choice of Simon+Richter or Alucard rather than Simon+Richter or Simon+Alucard. "
587," Based off how well it's sold so farand how warmly the game's received, and that continuous DLC of highly requested characters would help that even further, a second fighter pass (at least, if not more) should be a given. But we're talking about Nintendo who can turn shit into gold and gold into shit. They are not bound by logic.  "
588," Thanks for the heads up about Youtube. I'm an idiot who can't even remember which cord goes where when jumping a car, do you think it's easy enough to do without screwing up irreparably and flushing $70 down the drain?  "
589," It's not unthinkable that they do something like that a la Nintendo 3DS, but I'm here pretty frequently and haven't seen any rumors or announcements about that. 

If you're in question about a Switch, I'll just say some people had issues with bricked Switches at launch (2017). I bought on launch day and had pretty fantastic luck with no issues until about 6-ish months ago. 

The dock suddenly decided to stop outputting anything to the TV and it wasn't an HDMI cord issue. Sent into Nintendo for repairs and they gave me a new one. But other than that I've mostly had controller issues. Had a joystick issue on the included controller at launch pop up around the same time, but honestly I recommend the pro controller for any games that you don't have to use the D-pad (apparently the D-pad is wonky on those controllers). Other than that the controller is great and pretty similar to an Xbox controller.

The online is absolute shit, games are mostly great. Skip Mario Party, definitely get Zelda, Mario, Smash Bros, the new Super Mario Maker looks great. Lots of good indie platformers on it if that's your thing.

Buying a Switch was worth it for me for Breath of the Wild alone, but I'm a huge Zelda fan. If you're interested in a few games, I think it's worth it if you budget for a new controller as well. If you're tepid about it, I would say wait a little bit or try to find someone who has one and see if they've had issues, test it out, etc.  "
590," It's a shame because I really like(d) the joycons in the grip as a controller until that issue. 

Hope you find a fix, sorry I don't have a good solution for you, amigo.  "
591," I can't help you, I can tell you that the original joycons I got from launch day (specifically the left one) had a drifting issue and had to replace it recently. It was missing inputs and saying I was hitting directions I wasn't going in. Seems like others have had this issue too. I think the joycons just aren't as well made as past Nintendo controllers.  "
592," So I bought a pro controller and had it sitting next to an unopened canned drink that has sugar in it. 

It apparently was a faulty can because next time I looked it had a cut in it and was leaking everywhere including the controller, and now some of my buttons stick. They input, but they don't depress like usual.

Is there any good ways to clean this? It doesn't look like I can open the controller so I hope someone has a good workaround. Thanks in advance. "
593," Cool, not in now and will probably be out until 8 or 9 ESTish, but should be able to play then. 

If I don't catch you tonight, I'll be sure to add you and we can try to invite each other next time we're both on. I should be on a bunch tomorrow, including afternoon times. "
594," I heard a lot about how terrible Two and a Half Men was as a show before I actually watched any of it, and I gotta say, it's not awful. Some low hanging fruit and easy jokes but eh. 

But maybe my standards have lowered after seeing Two Broke Girls. Holy shit what a disaster.  "
595," Some people just like to only play with their own platform, either for trading or something. And Switch players have a bad reputation, I'm guessing due to weaker hardware that could lead to weaker play.

But either way, looking forward to it, have a good one. "
596," Nothing like Dead Flag Blues by Godspeed You! Black Emperor to get me in the mood. 

*""The car's on fire and there's no driver at the wheel
and the sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides
and a dark wind blows...*"" "
597," Hey, I'd be happy to play as long as you aren't a ""What a saver!"" when someone messes up or constantly spams wow. North America, G3 but been Plat2Div4 before. Still getting used to a new controller but I'm decent I think. 

Edit: I forgot to mention I'm a Switch player if that makes a difference to you. If it does, I understand.

If you want to play, feel free to hit me up at Mike#9912. "
598," I get we're shitting on Orlov and he deserves it in totality, he's been hugely disappointing and didn't challenge the play enough.

But how often are we going to have too watch Ovechkin try to play and push the puck like he's 25 and fail to push it and turn it over? I cringe when he has possession in 3v3 or power plays. He just doesn't have the Kuznetsov-like control anymore.  "
599, I would feel bad but he's just so fun to play as. I make up for it by being terrible at the game/Mac though.  
600, Aren't there trace amounts of arsenic in some of the common foods we eat? I swear I read that somewhere once.  
601, Same. I think the moves regarding him were a bad call and will continue to say that. Hope to be wrong and we'll see if that's the case. But  
602," This x100.

I could understand trading Roark in a vacuum, but trading him due to money and paying for an older Sanchez with health issues based off a small sample size of resurgence is fucking insane.

I don't think it will work out for us. I hope it does, but I doubt heavily.  "
603," It's a good call too. It's amazing what he's done so far in his career with basically only fastballs as reliable pitches. Sure, he'll occasionally throw a crazy good slider, but there's no consistency with his offspeed. If he did have consistency, batters beware.  "
604," This team is good. I don't know if they're ""win the division"" good, they absolutely could, but will they? Eh. 

It's a lot harder division than it has been in the past. Marlins are a dumpster fire but everyone else has some really good players and potential.

Unlike most Nats fans, I don't believe in the bullpen. At all. Doolittle is good if he's healthy, everyone else I believe is a bolded question mark.

I think the lineup will be good, not great. Maybe great if Zimmerman finds another genie in a bottle like 2016 (I think? The years blur together now) . Rotation is okay. Sanchez, Ross and Hellickson are iffy to me on health, talent or both. Top 3 is good but you can't count on a full Strasburg season any way.

I think we're 80 wins at worst, but I think we're 95 wins at best. If I had to predict, I guess I'd say we'll get 85.  "
605,"  It's nor about appreciating life, not at all. 2 or 3 weeks ago, I saw a video there where dad was playing with his son, slipped, fell onto him and killed him. I will forever remember that and will be extremely careful when I have a child of my own. 

Imagine being so heavy and so dumb you need a snuff video to teach you that. Or being so dumb you think people will buy that excuse.  "
606," Yeah I don't get it. Baseball teams already have Thriller-length choreographed signs to tell players to do something, line up a certain way, etc. 

But somehow this is the first solution to something that's hardly a problem instead of stopping the manager from taking the ball like a misbehaving kid's phone and spanking him?  "
607," On the one hand we got a bit unlucky and just didn't finish a lot of open chances, so not too upsetting. On the other hand, that type of 3 goal meltdown should never happen and that is upsetting.  "
608, Nah.  
609, Cry harder. This is embarrassing. This is Boudreau hockey like we've seen half the season.  
610, Peak Capitlols. 
611, Quelle surprise.  
612," Props to Copley, he played his ass off.  "
613," Yeah, really crazy to not want to lean too heavily on a guy getting older, because injuries and decline never hit older guys suddenly. Keep learning me good, galaxy brain.  "
614," Fine, if we're talking about rotations and considering all of talent, injury risk and contract situations, I'd rather be the Indians, Dodgers and Yankees. And there's a lot of teams with similar question marks that could end up better too, such as the Mets, Astros, Rockies, Rays, possibly Red Sox although I think Price is going downhill fast and his contract sucks. 

And holy shit I just remembered/realized we signed Anibal Sanchez too for some fucking reason. Let's throw another questionable starter into the mix because why not. "
615, Likewise.  
616," What the fuck are you even talking about? I don't give a shit about the rotation I don't know why you're harping on it, I care more about the shit bullpen and how bad this offense will be with Zimmerman at 1st and if Soto doesn't continue hitting out of his mind like sophomores often do. That's not even touching Michael K. Taylor and the basepath blunders that never get fixed despite the team ""working"" on them.

But if you insist on a hypothetical move Rizzo should have done regarding the rotation because you're apparently obsessed, he should build a time machine and slap himself stupid for spending $175MM for a good, not great pitcher that misses half of every fucking season. 

Or not traded so many starter prospects that we're relying on Ross (who doesn't go long any way) coming off an injury, unproven Fedde and 5-inning Hellickson as our bottom 3. 

That's a lot of innings the bullpen will have to pitch who aren't that good and why I'm down about the damn bullpen. "
617," What, 3 pitchers? Or rotations? Either way, at their peak that 3 is amazing. But expecting peaks from all 3 is terrible planning, and I don't think the rest of the team will be good enough to make up for it.

I'm not worried about those 3 any way, BP and possibly offense will be bigger issues.  "
618," Not in on Keuchel. Considering we've had BP problems every year basically, ""one of the better BP's we've had going into the season"" doesn't mean much. Scherzer/Strasburg/Corbin does not a top 3 rotation make, however good they may be. And I wouldn't even bank on them. Strasburg will get hurt, Corbin has shown signs of being meh.  "
619," .html means it's its own webpage and document, so unless this is some really weird fucked up way of designing the site I'm not aware of, it would be separate from the little blurbs which would be contained on the original page with those modes.  "
620," I mean I don't think we have one now any way outside of Doolittle. Barraclough and Rosenthal aren't that good, Miller is still unexperienced and I guess he's hurt. Glover never pitches any way so he has no bearing on the results. 

I have no idea why we're going into the season with an aging Scherzer, a perennially hurt Strasburg, Corbin, and Ross/Hellickson who neither go long, and this bullpen and expecting it to work. Some GMs are too risk averse, Rizzo is the opposite of that.  "
621," If they really do get rid of Buck, which would be colossally dumb, I hope he replaces Bob Carpenter on the Nats telecasts. I don't know how much he knows or cares about baseball, but the man has a golden voice and personality and I think he could do it. And Bob has dementia, so. "
622," Same. I don't get the love for Kara. She's fine, I don't hate her, but she's not Phil. And Phil and Buck have been the best thing about watching the Wizards in the past 5 years, and that is sadly said unironically. 
 "
623," Good, Glover next.  "
624," Sounds good, I plan to be on around 9 or 10 EST tonight but I'll add you when I get on and we can try to ping each other if we're both on whenever that may be. What's your name on RL that I should look out for?  "
625," I'm still in denial (or disbelief, rather) that it happened but the only thing that bugs me about it is that John Walton didn't say ""Good afternoon, good evening, and good night NHL!"" right after the clinch or anything to that effect. It haunts my dreams.  "
626," Hey, had success with this sub before cross-platform was available so felt like posting again.

I've been as high as plat 2 div 4 in soccar (plat 3 if you count dropshot for some reason, not sure how I got there at any point really) but looking to kill an hour and play some games before I sleep in about an hour. 

Would like to get better and rank up but not taking it too seriously tonight. Just got a new controller and am getting used to it and want someone cool to play with and not get bitched at for missing an aerial, save, etc. 

Definitely open to playing more games tomorrow and in the future, but have a bad schedule so might not play much during the week for the time being. 

RocketID is Mike#9912 if you want to play. Have a nice night. 

P.S. forgot to mention I like 2s and 3s and would like to play those. But down for any mode really if it isn't rumble. Just can't get into rumble, my apologies.  "
627, Can you post answers to the puzzle questions somewhere? Would like to know how I did on those.  
628, Execution. 
629," Lopez had (in my opinion) a promising beginning to his major league career with us. Ross has been solid when healthy. Zimmermann was awesome, Roark even though he spent a lot of time in the Texas system began his ML career with us and was solid. 

Fedde has looked better than Cole with us, are you kidding me? He might not ever be a dependable starter, it's too early to tell, but that's why I'd like to give him a spot to keep and see how he progresses. Better than throwing a ton of money at Keuchel who is showing reasons to worry about him moving forward. 

You're not wrong that we've been slacking in that category in recent years (especially in the bullpen), but I'd rather roll with that option than Dallas. "
630, No thanks. Would rather just have Fedde or another prospect and see if they can improve.  
631," He's probably gotten chicken at a restaurant hundreds of times too and I doubt it's ever been pink. Even if you're not a great cook, if you somehow cooked a steak that came out green unlike any other steak you've had, you would think you'd google it before eating it.  "

644,"  Basically he didn't bother to know or didn't care whether OP would be okay with a hookup text or FWB situation

*""Hey would you be cool with a text asking you to hook up?""*

...

*""Do you want to hook up?""*

You have to ask to know unless the person somehow volunteers that information. And again we're ascribing motives to him that we don't know. It's possible that he thought, ""Hey, I like OP and our friendship, it would be even better if it included sex, but if not, she's still a cool friend."" Not saying that's the case but it's possible, but he made the grave mistake of apparently gauging interest of FWB with someone he didn't know very well.  "
645,"  blockbuster QB

This statement is funny for a number of reasons.  "
646,"  We knew our space and Flacco's cap number

Look at you, assuming we don't have a fucking clown at GM. If you told me that the Ravens had to explain to Bruce that they couldn't and wouldn't Flacco to them because of financial constraints, I would believe you. "
647,"  and it's always unsettling to have someone you thought was a friend treat that friendship as disposable.

This is true but that's not necessarily the case. For all we know the guy likes to fuck his friends and it's run of the mill. He might have grown an attraction that wasn't there initially. Hell, or maybe he was interested all along, and the rejection might be too painful for him to continue the friendship. 

It doesn't have to be malicious. And the fact OP is close to throwing up about this is unsettling and she'll probably attribute it to malice when it might be anything but.  "
648, Imagine writing and feeling all that because of a simple hookup text. You're a hot mess express.  
649," I doubt we're getting another (general Nintendo) Direct before the end of April when Joker releases, so the fact that they didn't announce another of the DLC characters and teased something Stage Builderish looking makes me think we might get a Smash Direct.  "
650," I'm not against RE but I have a hard time thinking of how you could implement an RE character that would both have an interesting moveset that sets them apart somehow while being faithful to the games.

But then again I don't have much RE experience and I'm not Sakurai, so maybe my imagination just sucks. 
 "
651," I'm assuming you have general knowledge of how Tetris works. After the Nintendo Direct, they dropped a (free) game no one knew about called Tetris 99. It's jokingly being called Tetris Battle Royale because 99 players are simultaneously playing Tetris to see who lasts the longest. 

As you clear rows and whatnot, you can send rows of blocks to other players to try to get them to stack too high and fail. You can select a person, or choose from options, like sending them to a random person or sending lines to anyone who's sending stuff at you.

Because there's a lot of options of how players are selected to send garbage (extra Tetris lines) to, occasionally you'll find yourself ganged up on by tons of people making it hectic and easy to fail.

So I guess OP just thinks that's funny and suggested them as an AT as a way to represent Tetris. "

I was thinking it would be like [""Saints"", ""Rams""] and just kind of cycle through to make sure the first one in the array isn't the same as the penalized players get team method, so you could compare the two different teams. There's probably a more graceful way to do it, but I just went for the quick and dirty. "
674," I mean I'm lazy and not very good at code so it wouldn't surprise me if I fucked up somewhere, that took all of two minutes to write and most of that was spacing for Reddit formatting.

Replace *""Reflections of Society in Literature""* with something like *""Carrying Your Team to Victory""*, splice in a .gif of an almost impressive goal that bonks off the crossbar or something for Billy's response, and change the text to something like:

""Mr. Madison, at no point in your rambling, incoherent flip reset were you even close to anything that could be considered a good play...""

etc.

I've got Happy Gilmore ideas too if you ever get to that.

Like, I get the gist, for one he latches to the opponent and one he throws a banana peel.

But for the monkey flip, it seems like he does different things at different times and I'm not sure why.

As for the banana peel, I'm sure that's useful somehow at some points but I'm just not seeing why yet. When should you be banana peeling? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
691," Ah yes, when I think of unfathomable, horrifying creatures, I think of the teen years of Fantastic 4's The Thing.  "
692," In the game that just happened, I selected New York on the sports team question in time, it said I got it wrong (luckily I had the pass), then decided ""fuck you"" and wouldn't give me any options on the next question.

And the game lag constantly. At least the payouts are worth it (lol). "
693, Tripping for palettes.  
694," I finally beat World of Light. I was so pumped, by the end I wasn't even playing it because I loved it or wanted the satisfaction of beating it. All I wanted was to be able to change the menu music because as nice as the main theme is, I've grown tired of it and needed a break.

I beat WOL, go the music menu to finally change it (after deliberation I had decided The Great Sea theme from Wind Waker was up first), and... you only have about 20 choices. And many of them variations on the same fuckin' theme I'm trying to get away from.

Oh yeah, as added fuck you bonuses that !playable Master Hand section! can only be done once apparently and the platforming section prior to the boss was a reminder of the Adventure Mode I had hoped Spirits would resemble. 

Love the game but that was frustrating and Picasso could have an entire period of work from the hue the color my balls are.  "
695," The game has been rumored to have ""Minecraft content"" (though not *necessarily* a character) since May/Juneish by a leaker who ended up being almost 100% right about other things in the game (Simon Belmont, Incineroar, etc.)

There's a strong possibility that something Minecraft will end up in the game somehow, but I wouldn't bank on it just yet. "
696," Exactly, the anti-fast casual burrito places complaints are usually dumb. 

It's like comparing Phil Mickelson to your friend who plays 18 every Saturday while crushing 6 beers in between and bitching about his dead-end sales job and dilapidated house. They're vaguely similar but both have completely different goals and purposes.  "

IT'S EVEN BETTER WHEN ONE OF THOSE MATCHES STARTS WITH AN AFK TEAMMATE THAT DISCONNECTS THAT LEAVES YOU 1V2 OR 2V3.

AND THE BEST IS WHEN THE OPPONENT'S TEAM LOSES A PLAYER AND IS DOWN 3-0 SO ANOTHER LEAVES, AND YOUR TEAMMATE DECIDES TO START BLOCKING SHOTS THAT YOU TRY TO MAKE. IS HE DOING IT TO GIVE THE POOR OPPONENT A FIGHTING CHANCE AND BE COOL? NO, BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH GAMESMANSHIP AND UNDERSTANDABLE. INSTEAD IT'S BECAUSE HE WANTS TO BE THE ONE TO SCORE THE GOALS AND RUN UP THE SCORE. HE LITERALLY WENT OUT OF HIS WAY TO SAVE GOALS ONLY TO TURN AROUND AND TRY SICK DRIBBLES AND WEIRD ANGLE SHOTS. AND WE FUCKING LOST BECAUSE OF IT. 

JUST GOOD STUFF, REALLY.  "

710," I had a dream where Ultimate had 3 DLC Packs and counting, and all the characters were just awesome dream picks at first, Devil May Cry was there, I got Rayman so I was super happy. 

And by the end of the dream I was just felt bad because they were adding characters like Venonat and actual Goombas and Geno and Banjo Kazooie fans were crying and saying, *""Next one's the one, guys...""* "
711," I'm not gung ho about sending off Gruden, I think he's great at designing plays but he has no idea how to call plays in game and doesn't seem to learn. But yeah, we get blown out way too often and don't even look competitive. That Giants team is bad, even with our injuries we should have been in it, especially with no OBJ. I could take him or leave him, really.

Allen's got to go, though. "

713, Raphael Soriano should have been the end of ownership meddling.

723," Lol I went that path first so didn't have many options, tried with Kirby, gave up, and finally beat it after maybe 10 matches with Mario with some luck on my side. Holy shit, fuck that spirit.  "
724," Thanks for answering. A few more Q's, does his games revolve around combos or like Ryu or any ""unique"" fighting system as far as Smash is concerned? Would he be fast, slow, or somewhere in between? What sort of genre is Persona any way?  "
725, Can someone explain briefly what Persona games are like and what his moveset might be like? I know literally nothing about this other than people like Persona games and people are happy about this. 
726, I just had to quit after I reached a spirit in WOL that uses Bayonetta and does nothing but spam her sliding kick/upward kick. Holy fuck I hate this character already and it's my second time ever playing against her. 
727," Kind of jank, but oh well. Appreciate the answer homie! "
728," I have a really dumb question but I cannot figure this out. I just started World of Light, and I'm trying to figure out how to modify the controls to swap some buttons.

I already created a new controller layout with a name, but I'm not sure how to actually *select* it.

Any help would be greatly appreciated. "
729," It does to me, but I haven't played with Brawl. Fucking hell it feels sloggy and tough. I know I'll get used to it eventually, but tonight is rough. Lol. "

736," I'm not sold on Fedde or Voth or anyone else we have right now for the #5, I honestly wouldn't be against an old college try for it. He had moments of brilliance last season when doing long relief.  "

738," Well done, dude.  "
739, One of the few polls I've seen where I can vote for Bubsy who I unironically want. 
740, Maybe if we all collectively pretend he's from FE Sakurai might actually put him in. 
741," True, but didn't Nintendo deny the existence of some new version of the DS a day before they announced it? I'm pretty sure that happened. "
742, I still don't think that's a good bullpen.  
743, I'd be happier with this if we weren't paying gobs of money to Strasburg who you're lucky to get half a season out of.  
744, Only thing better than this terrible game and season is getting endlessly lectured by Softbrains and the Pants Shitter. 
745," Don't teleport behind me, it's nothing personnel, kid. When did I say that only Western choices matter? I just don't really care for most of their top requests. 

Besides, if anyone's choices haven't mattered it's the West's. Other than Ridley, I don't think there's anyone that was mostly a Western request, all the rest were either Japan or requested heavily by both.  "
746, Japan shit taste confirmed. Genuinely surprised to see Crash in the top 5 though.  
747," Go for it, I am curious to see what characters people would actually hate instead of being ambivalent to.  "
748,"  There is a very small list of characters who I would be disgusted in seeing though.

You're no fun, start some drama, list some names. That's how I feel about that Granblue character shit which I hope isn't true.  "
749," Mine's just started drifting, not responding to input, etc. too, right after I had to send in my Switch because either it or the dock shit out and wouldn't transmit audio to the television. Guess I have to buy a pro controller now. Shit sucks. "
750, Jordan Patterson ABSOLUTELY DESTROYS NL Central's flimsy pitching with HUGE DONGS and RESPECTABLE BATTING AVERAGE.  
751, Does anyone have any good training pack codes to recommend for jumping/boosting from walls to take shots?  
752, Nice last play you incompetent fucks.  
753, Do you have a source for this?  
754," It's a shitty work ethic because *most* people outside of Japan know when they're working to the point of deteriorating health and to, you know, slow down. And if you don't, that's your prerogative but you don't get kid gloves for it. For all we know he's working hard over inconsequential things or stuff that could be delegated to someone else any way.  "
755," They're still all over /r/redskins, there's just a lot of dumbasses who are Skins fans.   "
756, I'd settle for a QB who throws a ball beyond 15 yards that doesn't look like a limp noodle.  
757, I miss Cousins. 
758," Well, there's your problem, the one area KFC definitively is better than Popeye's is the biscuits. Not to say Popeye's are bad, however.  "
759, I'd at least have a modicum of respect if they just said they had a bad angle to see it or blinked or something. I'd like to believe they're really incompetent but it gets harder for me to believe that.  
760," You should try the movie Kingpin. It's a lot of sophomoric humor like most Farrelly movies but like most of them has heart and I enjoy it. Whichever Quaid that is and Bill Murray are good in it too, and I don't particularly enjoy Murray.  "
761," Yeah, it's a dumb argument any way. Expecting every team to steamroll the other so bad calls don't affect it is preferable but it rarely happens. If it did happen often, we'd have an NBA-style broken league in terms of talent disparity.  "
762," Oh boy, can't wait for another week where this sub pretends Alex Smith was good and we get an apology for officiating mistakes but absolutely nothing changes.  "
763, Dropping an F for your karma.

Uhhuh. Sure. "
766," I don't know man, I saw *Snowboard Academy*.  "
767," Holy shit, it triggers me when people want to watch and guess along but don't pay attention to the categories when Alex announces them. Sometimes you don't need them depending on the clue, but yeah, sometimes they're essential.  "
768," Ah shit, I totally forgot the category was ""Presidential Irony"" and didn't make the connection about the ""going nowhere"" part. I'm an idiot. It just seemed like an old name so I guessed Andrew Jackson so I guess I was in the right decade at least.  "
769," How did that one contestant not even get a guess off? There's only 45 choices, sure it's a long shot but put down something.  "
770," 20 years from now, Rathalos fans will have the last laugh in Smash 10.  "
771, The fix is in.  
772, Imagine thinking recognizing a shit QB put in front of you week after week is hate and ignorance. 
773," He's a slightly better John Beck, he's fucking shit. I know a record like 6-3 can cloud judgement but come on. "
774,"  Dude was starting to put together some nice drives.

Lol. No he wasn't. Smith is garbage.  "
775," I'm on board for signing him. Zimmerman will probably be injured and is bad at this point any way, plus his contact skills really change this team, especially with Turner and maybe Robles on the bases.  "
776," I understand the backup preparation thing, it happens, I don't agree with the rest. We were winning in spite of Alex Smith, if McCoy can play to his level or better, we're fine. And based on yesterday, I think he could. "
777," You know some dumb Redskins fans then. Lots of people wanted to keep Cousins. And as bad a game he had tonight, he's still better than Smith by miles. It's not really close.  "
778, Alex Smith should not return because he's a shitty QB.  
779, What a crap call. 
780," No, but a different QB doesn't have an albatross of a contract and play like shit.  "
781, You don't need data points to see McCoy was more decisive and moved the ball easier so your shitty webcomic can suck a veiny one.  
782," ""probably""

There's no probably, he is.  "
783," I like how people have been laughing at people who were calling for McCoy, and he almost won the game. He's better than Smith, if anything this helps us.  "
784, Wouldn't surprise me if that was a move made just to spite Cousins. Like when your hot girlfriend breaks up with you for not committing to her and then giving the next one a huge ring two months into the relationships.  
785," I think the easier and better solution would be to have the option to disable certain Assist Trophies like Item Switch, and keep ATs to characters who wouldn't really work as fighters that aren't heavily requested, like Andross and Nintendogs. *(Yes, I understand Piranha Plant and that Sakurai could probably make a bowl of fettuccine an appealing moveset, but let's be honest, characters like those two examples have no real chance until we get to Smash 86 in the year 2154, after all other requests and characters have been realized.)* "
786," I didn't play 4 and don't remember it being in Brawl, but I would love [Ice Cap Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TT_b3YU8SRk list=RDQM9HAOf62Dxso start_radio=1) from Sonic 3 to be in it. 

This was just a random cover I pulled off Youtube because it was the first result but yeah, always loved that theme. "
787," I still don't really understand any of the new modes from SmUsh, they just seem convoluted and overwrought with powerups, which really just doesn't interest me. That was almost as big a letdown from the final direct as the last characters.  "
788," If McCarthy was even an anarchist and let the team decide amongst themselves, I think they would have a better record.  "
789," I just never remember that Pringles has a mustachioed mascot, actually.  "
790, It's basically dirty vinegar.  
791," Old Bay, Cajun/Creole seasoning (shoutout to Tony Chachere's), and Lowry's Seasoning Salt are the holy trinity of spice mixes that can go on anything and make it taste better.  "
792," To whom does ""Pringles"" refer to?  "
793," \Changing the name of the award

\Knowing you basically lose the game if you give up one run means zero pressure

This take is so diarrhea I can't even cup it in my hands. deGrom 100% deserved it and I bet you would agree if Scherzer and he switched places.  "
794," Not that I'm good, but for professional videos, Lethamyr's videos in particular make me feel like I've improved a ton by watching. He does a good job of articulating what he's doing and why. A lot of times I've watched him and thought, ""Wow, if someone who can control the car wasn't going for that ball/challenge, why have I been doing it this whole time?"" "
795," I wish I could, I don't know anyone else with one. Let alone one with RL. It sucks enough being without it for 3 weeks while they figure out the issue and paying $60. :( 

If I lose it, not the end of the world, just a lot of random shit and crates, but would be cool to keep it.

I appreciate your reading and responding a ton. "
796," I do, but all I know is I can redownload the game. As far as I know the items don't transfer over, it doesn't have an account like with Epic for Fortnite. "
797," Yeah, that's my issue. I don't think it does, but can't find anything definitive either way and haven't gone through this myself. Appreciate the response, amigo! "
798," I have to send in my Switch for repairs and could conceivably lose the console. Wondering if I should try to trade items with someone before I send it in, in case I do lose the console and have to start over. 

Thanks in advance for the help. "
799," And Green almost won them game 7 any way, lol. This feels like when you get punished for showing up or pissing off the coach's son.  "
800," Yes, they talk about this in the August Direct when they revealed the Final Smash meter.  "
801, As a person with color vision and an enjoyment of music I cannot overstate how offensive those 30 seconds were.  
802," ""Mannning"" in the graphic. Lol. Nice work ESPN. "
803, Imagination can't resist the laziness. 
804," It's funny how when anyone on this sub talks about the NFC East clinching game against Philly, they only talk about Cousins taking a knee. It was indeed a dumb play, but I never see anyone talk about how absolutely clinical he was passing the ball both before and after that play. It's just ""lol kirk knee ecks dee"".

I have no idea why this sub has a hate boner for the guy who was the main reason the team wasn't a a flaming massive dumpster fire since 2015.  "
805," Me too, I need Rayman in Smash yesterday. Fingers crossed for DLC.  "
806, Bayonetta's bullets are slightly different. Did you notice it? 
807," *Ctrl + F ""Rayman""*

Excellent, all according to plan.

812, I was expecting it to be the guy was strangling hookers or something. Seems a bit overboard but what do I know.  
813, What shit? I always wondered why that guy suddenly stopped appearing everywhere. 
814," Corbin, Kimbrel/Miller, extend Rendon.  "
815," Oh, yes, I tried with different ports on the TV. There's no way it's the cables, definitely the console or the dock, just not sure which. What a bunch of shit. Thanks for trying. "
816," I'm not sure what you mean on the first part, regular TV volume is fine, both HDMI cables seem to have the same issue which seems unlikely to me. I don't know anyone else who owns a Switch, no. "
817," It works fine in handheld, but does not work when docked. It's putting the picture through just fine, just sound isn't working. I did replace the HDMI cord with another and still the same issue. "
818," So the audio on my Switch isn't working anymore. Was perfectly fine two days ago before the Youtube update, anyone know any possible solutions? "
819, Same. I'm still shocked they put in K. Rool who was my #1 request. It's going to be hard juggling SSBU and RL when it comes out.  
820, I love how DeRosa just had a blast with it.  
821," Glad he turned it down, I just hope the Nats don't try to go any higher to keep him.  "
822, I'm gonna main the Geico Gecko (with not even a Gex Echo). Just not sure if I'd buy the prime membership to skip having to watch a 30-second ad after every 5 matches.  
823," I agree, I doubt even those two guys would have won today if they were on the Redskins, but I still think the offense should have been more competitive and there's a double standard around here, not necessarily you, but just around. "
824, The last direct just proved that popularity doesn't mean much.  
825," I don't think it's his fault, but it was still a poor outing which he is a part of to only score 14 against this defense. If Kirk played this exact same game people would be calling for his head.  "
826," I wish I could say the hypocrisy being shown by the sub is astounding, but no, you could pretty much see this coming. Fuck Kirk for not dragging this team to the playoffs (when he probably dragged a 2-win team to 7) but Alex Smith gets all the excuses.  "
827," \14 points

\Ball out

Lmfao the absolute state of Redskins quarterbacking.  "
828, Perhaps the behavior was not constantly sipping Kool-Aid. 
829," I know I'm late but I can't believe how incredibly stupid that Norman tackle and PI was. You're already down multiple TDs, whether you hold them to a FG or not doesn't matter, what matters is getting off the field without points.

So you're trailing the guy by three whole yards (like any top-paid corner does) and have a perfect view of him twisting his body, trying to track where the hell that ball is going. Just let it go and hope for the drop. 

He might get a TD, but it doesn't matter if he does, because your offense is bad and has shown no ability to score quickly. You need to get off the field without points. It's 3rd down, just hope for the drop, because by tackling you're wasting more time and 99% guaranteeing a FG at least. 

Just so. Fucking. Dumb.  "
830, Can someone make a compilation of all the calls on us and non-calls on the Falcons? This is getting ridiculous. 
831," I don't blame the defense. They were playing out of their mind and dragging the team to wins, the officials are giving them the short end of the stick and the Falcons have a ton of offensive talent. 

I do blame the offense for not even keeping it close against a poor defensive team.  "
832, Two different rulebooks for the two teams. What a bunch of shit.  
833," Remember when Cousins was blamed for not taking a team with more injuries, worse defense and Doctson as his best receivers, to the playoffs? "
834, This sub also acts like Nintendo holds his family hostage to make these games. It's baffling.  
835," God, if it really is Minecraft and some dumb mobile game's character, that's just really fucking sad.  "
836," Yeah, that's why I said ""seemingly"". But breakdancing at a game, the heckling at the kid's game, the marriage proposal rejection on the mound, he gets a ton of them. The only other one I can think of that Q doesn't get is the ""Let's get sexy"" one with Sal.  "

839," I'm good, dude, keep up with the thought police thing though, I'm sure you'll convince people. "
840, You're delusional if you don't think Sakurai doesn't research characters he puts in games enough to pick up on things like a unique camera angle from a heavily requested character.  
841,"  All on /r/nintendo! Usually a rule of thumb is, if a game is new, therefore it is bad, before it even releases.

You forgot the corollary, ""If a game is over two years old, it's a classic, I want a barebones port immediately, and there's no way they didn't do the best they could, how dare you for suggesting that.""

I feel out of place on there and /r/NintendoSwitch, maybe I'm just the RedLetterMedia crowd of it but I love the company but have become cynical and want them to do well, but they can be really hard to defend. Really hard.  "
842,"  Honestly I think this direct was aimed much more at the casual players than us hardcore fans 

While this makes sense, why would casual fans be watching a Smash Direct? I'm sure there was a good number, seems to me most people would be hardcore fans.

Other stuff like the brightness and languages was there because let's be honest, we'd all hate it if we got in the game and had to mash past a bunch of text boxes telling us what each individual menu option does, and since there's no paper manual, I can't imagine me finding those options myself until at least dozen hours in.

I can't buy this, sorry. There's no way that was the intention of that, because I still don't know what exactly Spirits and Holy Light entail, and where one begins and the other ends. People confident enough to buy this will surely be patient enough to read a few options menus if they decide they need to.  "
843," Ana was awesome, what a sweetheart.  "
844," They were, I loved them, I wished they showed their reactions.  "
845," Q must be a big baseball fan or something, he gets seemingly all the baseball related punishments. 

Great episode though.  "
846," Sure, but we could make the same argument for L-shaped Tetris Block and 8-bit Octoroks or something.

Don't get me wrong, I'd be up for those ideas too in a vacuum, and Piranha looks surprisingly fun and like they gave as much love as they could to him. But with so many popular requests still left it kind of sucks. Still buying the game, still hoping the best for DLC. I just can't help but empathize with fans of characters who got killed off today.   "
847," No arguments there, that was a letdown, I expect at least a few more tracks.  "
848,"  Im glad he does the hard work on these games and hes a talented dude obviously, but this game in particular is lacking what I get most excited about in a new Smash Bros, which is new characters.

x100. A game like Smash is its characters, you better have darn good characters or darn good modes. Unfortunately it feels like Ultimate is kind of half-assed on both.

The most frustrating thing about Sakurai is that he makes some seriously amazing characters. Characters like Duck Hunt are awesome and imaginative, and look at how faithfully he treated characters like Mega Man and K. Rool, they look like hardcore fan's dream movesets. So you start to think, ""Oh man, Sakurai really IS that good.""

And then he does something like making Ganondorf a clone or pulling a Thanos on half the fans' most popular requests and you go, ""Oh."" "
849,"  I think we got enough new characters

I'll disagree. I like the actual newcomers we got, but we only got like 5 unique movesets. It's not what I think of when I think of ""Ultimate"" and how excited I was at its first reveal. 

And then I look at the Spirits/Adventure Mode. To me it looks like a mess and something I won't bother with beyond unlocking the roster, and wonder how many cool newcomers we could have gotten with that development time. Not to mention less clone-y echos.   "
850," That's a bold claim to make without any way of proving it. He's done well in just about every poll the numerous sites have done over the years. That's more than can be said for Piranha. The anime sword thing is dumb, he has magic to set him apart, and even if that was the perception people had and Sakurai was trying to avoid, it wouldn't explain there being 3 movesets shared across, what, 8 FE characters?  "
851," I don't think they said that at all. All they mentioned was that they hadn't begun yet on it, not that it hadn't been decided.  "
852, lmao dude post more 
853, ...Loveseats? Is this a term I'm not familiar with?  
854, Cool strawman.  
855," I am calm, bud, but continue to write screeds about how people need to calm down if it helps you justify your purpose or feel better or whatever.  "
856," No, I'm saying that their choices of who and what to develop was disappointing given the ending and what could have been. "
857, Because people were disappointed at the idea of Kencineroar being the final reveals back when the Grinch Leak was a madman's fever dream.  
858," I mean, think whatever you want. No point in entertaining you, you won't be convinced, I won't outside of some DLC characters I really I like. The game will be fun, definitely buying, definitely will have fun, but there's a lot of wasted potential.  "
859," I can't help you on Goku but I'm down on the director part, been that way for years.  "
860," I just am not a fan of RPGs, but I feel like Smash needs more magic users, and the thought of a character who has earth/plant based magic is pretty cool. That's why I was hoping for Isaac, personally.  "
861," Tell me what else you need for a line, I'll happily give you a bingo. Hell, I can give you a blackout depending on your spaces.  "
862," Even without the leak people would have been disappointed, dude.  "
863," Good, I'm happy for you. I won't lie to you and say I won't buy the game or play the character, hell, he might be fun. But I'm frustrated with decisions Sakurai has made and I certainly understand why others who were more invested in certain characters are as well.  "
864," You are mixing prestige and popularity. What warranted their Golden Sun is the popularity on the ballot and interesting moveset potential, their place in Nintendo history is just bonus fluff. 

Duck Hunt and G W have more prestige no doubt, but they weren't requested to the extent a Golden Sun character was, which we had assumed was the basis of the ""Ultimate"" selling point. 

Piranha Plant doesn't even have the same ""prestige"" or popularity or memeability of boos or goombas. Piranha probably took as much effort coming up with moves as making him, whereas a character like Isaac is like Mega Man where the moves are basically made for them.

If you like PP, I'm happy for you and am not trying to rain on your parade, but it's futile and sort of piling on if you can't see why other people are baffled at how they treated some ballot requests.  "
865," +1 for the edit, made me laugh which I sorely needed.  "
866,"  Obviously not his fault but still.

I mean, it basically is though. "
867," I want to share your optimism, but they already specified they have 5 DLC characters planned. I find it hard to believe that they don't already have an idea of who those 5 will be.  "
868," I got it, I misconstrued your comment as a little more malicious than intended, I apologize. 

I agree that I don't think other appearances in Ultimate (like Rex) deconfirms a character 100%, but I would say it significantly lowers their chances. If they planned on 5 DLC characters before launch, I think they'd have a good idea of who to add and decide not to add anyone they're going to use. "
869," You realize why this is a dumb statement, right? His game being too new means it came out too late to have the time for them to develop him into a full character. Heck, maybe even too little time for him to being an AT and instead relegated him to costume status.

And the worst part is, I think Rex supporters would probably want his costume excluded because it would up his chances for DLC. Sure, characters in Smash 4 got costumes that eventually became characters, but for this current game? It's not a death knell but it's darn close. 

We're living in a world where Game and Watch and Duck Hunt are characters. As important as they are to gaming history, they were irrelevant at time of inclusion. If they can get in, one of Nintendo's most popular GBA games and bigger RPGs can get it just because it's on a decade drought.  "
870," I'm not sure how to read your comment, it sounds like you're saying this to lift people's spirits, but if popular requests with moveset potential like Isaac are getting relegated to AT status and killing their chances, I'm not sure why anyone would be happy about that.

Swapnote type of ATs are awesome where you know the character has 0.01% chance or wouldn't work. For characters like this though? Not awesome.  "
871,"  It's clear PP is supposed to be the wtf character no one expects. They serve different purposes

So does a fork and a toilet plunger but I don't want a toilet plunger at the dinner table.

In a vacuum, I can accept Piranha Plant as a fighter, because I think King Boo would be awesome as well. But to make him a fighter after ""referencing the ballot"" for this game as was stated, and freezing out popular requests by making them spirits or whatever, is just retarded.

It's 2018 and we still can't play as fucking Toad in Smash Bros but we can play as Piranha Plant. In no goddamn way will that ever be defensible to me.  "
872," ""Spots"" don't exist, but development time and effort do. Somehow Isaac with all his requests and with a chance to revive his series was less important than a generic piranha plant. I don't need to see the ballot results we'll never see to feel safe in wagering everything that Isaac had more requests.

So the parent comment is not wrong. It's an insult at worst and a horrible selection at best for the ""ultimate"" Smash Bros.  "
873," \People still arguing relevancy mattering for Smash characters in 2018

 "
874," Assuming that characters referenced in spirits, assist trophies and costumes can't or won't be turned into DLC characters, that means Isaac, Shadow, Shantae, and Chibi Robo all were popular requested and effectively killed and were somehow less priority than a fucking generic piranha plant.

The only character of those I have any remote interest in is Isaac, and I won't lie, I'm mad.  "
875," Guess what, even if people expected it, most would probably still be let down. It was a shit ending.  "
876, I hate you Sakurai. 
877," If there isn't any more characters at the end in a fakeout, Sakurai fucked up hard.  "
878, Fuck everything 
879," People appreciate all he's done, that's not even close to not being the case. If anything people seem afraid to dislike anything he's done because the games in totality are great and all you hear about is his arthiritis and shit.  "
880," OP said 5 characters, you only listed 2.  "
881," Same. I sort of want him just because I think more magic users would be cool but I have no idea what that would entail since I never played Golden Sun. But I mostly want him for his fans, they've already gotten the shaft with Golden Sun apparently being abandoned. Plus it would open more space for lesser known requests than the usual Isaac, Geno, Banjo, etc.  "
882," I don't have a connection to Golden Sun, but 

If Sakurai was to make him an AT again, after he was missing from Smash 4 and was heavily requested and essentially kill his chances of being Ultimate DLC, post what is most probably a hint at Isaac with the Rathalos picture, and wait until the very end direct to deconfirm Isaac as a playable character unlike he did with Waluigi, I would honestly lose some respect for Sakurai.

That would be incredibly deaf or malicious of him, perhaps both.  "
883," That's not confirmed or necessarily true, although it is likely.  "
884," Now that we have a win and can't go winless, I unironically hope we lose every game from here on out.

There's no chance Brooks would survive that, and the only way Ernie survives that is if he knows where Ted buried the bodies (which wouldn't actually surprise me, to be honest).

You can rebuild a house with a bad foundation, but sometimes it's easier and cheaper to just bulldoze it and start anew. I legitimately think it would be in our best interest in the long term.  "
885, I hope like shit they have bullshit sources because those predictions sound like garbage.  
886, The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.  
887," I liked the transformation Final Smashes you could control, I wish they hadn't changed that. "
888," ""Keep expectations realistic"" in these posts always means ""keep expectations low"".

""and let people get this out of their system instead of being too cynical""

What a conflict. I think it'll be a massive misstep if Sakurai doesn't add fan favorites like Geno, Isaac, etc. to this game, especially in the wake of our already confirmed newcomers, but I'm sure this sub will think those expectations are unrealistic because Sakurai can do no wrong. 
 "
889, Turn that poop into wine! 
890," I do not like them, no matter where I am

So do not ask me for anything ever again. "
891," Worst case scenario: They confirm a character or two from the Grinch leak but don't show the banner for whatever reason. Speculation lives in, cities crumble. "
892," Finally, I've been wanting to main Bubsy for years.  "
893," I really hate when people post stuff like this to try to hype police. People are allowed to be disappointed. I would be disappointed if the last of the roster was Kencineroar and a SE rep even if the Grinch leak had never come about.

K. Rool was my most wanted, and Simon and Ridley look awesome, but I would expect a little more from a game subtitled ""Ultimate"". I don't even particularly want the characters in the leak, they're not a dream character for me like Mike Jones from Star Tropics or Rayman. 

But with the leak I could actually be satisfied and think it would be worthy of ""Ultimate"" with all those characters being highly requested or unique. And hey, I might grow to really like them, who knows.

Kencineroar and Square Enix rep though? Nah. That would be weak. 
 "
894," I can only imagine how the Caps' last few years would have gone if they hadn't traded Forsberg. Jesus, what an awful trade.  "
895," No, it was not insensitive in the least, and tons of people said it was farfetched as well. Despite Pokemon refusing to show episodes with earthquakes and whatnot in the past.  "
896," I think it's funny because at the time, so many people were so adamant and so mad if you even suggested they would delay the Direct due to Isaac or other potential content in the Direct.  "
897," I don't know, because even if this is leak, there's probably still tons of non-joke characters heavily requested on the Smash 4 ballot that would still need to be in before necessitating a new ballot.

But then again new characters have come out since that and perhaps Sakurai doesn't like or think any of the remaining characters on the ballot would really fit and may want updated opinions.  "
898, You know what hurts more than this loss? The fact that tomorrow Grunfeld and Brooks will still be employed.  
899,  and want to take back ~~New York~~ New New Amsterdam.  
900," Yes, he reported both, but any rumor that seemed to contradict either of those he just barely gave the light of day or refused to entertain. "
901, It'll never happen but I would love a dark or ground type pokemon. Or psychic pokemon that actually seems psychic beyond Mewtwo.  
902, Could be a good way to get people more hyped than usual about the upcoming generation and make them want to find and catch them in Gen 8. It wouldn't surprise me if they did Incineroar/whomever + Gen 8 pokemon as a package deal sort of DLC.  
903," Gracias, I couldn't hear what she said as I had the volume too low. Between that and the final Jeopardy that was a heartbreaking game for her when she did pretty well.  "
904, What was the answer for the oldest U.S. congress committee?  
905," True, but he was also all in on loz18 and seemed to refuse to entertain any info contrary to his or Vergeben's posts until loz went full retard. For that reason I don't think he's clickbaiting, but may not have the best nose for who's a good source or not. And he doesn't really give us any solid reasoning to believe him any more than other ""insiders"" who seem dubious right now.  "
906," ""If the leaked roster doesn't on the box fit, you must acquit.""  "
907," If it's fake, Saudi Arabia is immediately hiring this guy to be their PR fixer.  "
908, It's either real or the amount of detail and effort put into it I think even surpasses Omni's Rayman video.  
909, The conspiracist in me wonders if they're trying to cover for Big N.  
910," Well, yeah no shit hardcore fans, that's what this has all been seemingly about pleasing. Otherwise stage hazards would be auto and Goku would be a character because ""general audience"".  "
911," Assuming Incineroar was actually chosen for Smash, I could see them opting to make him a DLC character. It's not like people are dying for him on the same level of Isaac, Banjo, etc. Hell, you could package him and a new pokemon character they develop for the new title next year.  "
912, Really? Those seem like two of the more obvious choices since Sakurai seems to be going for fan's wants this time around. 
913," It would not surprise me much if this was true. I've felt from the beginning Sakurai's *""...so I hope you aren't expecting too many new challengers...""* quote seemed like the sort of lie Sakurai would say to blow people away and it's why I've never believed the box theory spoiling the last couple spots.

Still, I've been thinking 4-5 more after Isabelle, this would blow that out of the water.  "
914, Now I can't unread it in his voice. Nice catch.  
915," I wish Morris played like that all game, every game. Not even the 3 pointers necessarily, just aggressive rebounding, good timing and smarter decisions on when to challenge. 

P.S. fire Grunfeld and Brooks. "
916," He also had what, all of a week to learn the plays and practice before being thrown into the fire on a pretty ugly team?

I mean, Anderson isn't good, but he's not that bad either.  "
917, I remember how awful he was in that Cowboys game giving them a pick and fumble directly and people here still shitting on Cousins after the game like he wasn't the only thing keeping us breathing in that game.  
918," Yeah, it's ticky-tacky, but most of the penalties in the NFL are. A WR can stab a DB on a fade and get called for nothing, a DB breathes on a WR and gets PI and the death penalty. And then ten minutes later the absolutely same thing can get called the opposite way.

Which I think is one of the biggest reasons NFL viewership is lower than it has been in the past.  "
919," It's even tougher to be great when you throw hospital balls to your top receiving options, launch the ball to the moon in the redzone when there's a receiver with a possible play on the ball, miss open receivers because you take absolutely no risk and run out of bounds with a chance to use the other team's last TO.

He is garbage and getting carried.  "
920,"  If you put a good team around Alex, he'll get you places.

More like he'll jump in the car along for the ride, every once in a while he'll bring a few extra waters or bags of chips. Dude's bad.  "
921, Anyone with half-working eyes and a half-working brain should be pissed.  
922," Usually I say Jay Gruden has no balls and it costs us, today he had negative balls. They shot upwards into his chest like rockets and he and Smith deserved a big fat L for it today. 

They are so goddamn lucky the defense is finally good enough to bail them out.  "
923, I'm rooting for Bane to take over the field a la TDKR.  
924, Imagine actually clapping for Jeffress after the postseason he's had.  
925," Huh, I thought we learned Jeremy Jeffress was trash like a week ago. Funny how that happened. Good fucking going, Brewers.  "
926," Two down, only 80 more ""Fire Grunfeld"" and ""Fire Brooks"" posts to go. "
927," Have some faith in the team, man.  "
928, I would take 0-82 if it got rid of Grunfeld and Brooks.  
929, Don't worry the Raptors are.  
930, Remember last year when the defense sucked ass but everyone said it was early and would come together? And it didn't? Fun stuff. Good thing we can go no wrong with Dear Leader Brooks.  
931, They're like satellite dishes for the devil to whisper ideas into.

937, They should just have the whole Mega Man 2 and 3 soundtracks remixed on SSBU. Bangers galore.

940," I really like this guy's tutorial and training pack:

Something I also started doing that helps me stick close to the ball off the wall is hitting the brake/reverse button just before hitting the ball and jumping. It seems to make the hit a little softer, and I use the same button as my air roll so I just hold it and start rolling after jumping.  "

950," Not that the defense is playing well right now, but if we lose it's completely on the offense for scoring a whopping 6 points in the second half when there were many more points to be had. Alex Smith is the sugarfree gum of quarterbacks. No killer instinct.  "
951, We all know how this ends.  
952," I mean, you knew it was coming. Jeffress got out of it lucky in the last inning. Sending him back out was dumb.  "

1013," Hi all,

I'm trying to use flexbox to make a tournament bracket like those you would find during [March Madness](https://athlonsports.com/sites/athlonsports.com/files/Printable_NCAA_March_Madness_Bracket_1.jpg) but am having a little issue with lining up parts.

[Here is the JSFiddle I'm working with.](https://jsfiddle.net/9brz380m/)

As you can see, the ""second round"" doesn't line up with the borders created by the first.

I'm trying to justify the content to ""space-around"" under .round.roundtwo .round which I think would help space them closer to the boxes where I could just fiddle around with the margins until it looks right, but it doesn't seem to respond to any justify-content properties.

Any help in understanding why ""justify-content"" isn't working for that particular class would be greatly appreciated and thanks for reading. Feel free to give any tips as well you feel would help. "
1014," I'd like put some faces in front of the people and have it look convincing, wondering what the best way do this. If anyone could just give me a walkthrough over the major steps it would be greatly appreciated.  "
1015," Hi, I hope I can explain this well and someone can help. 

I have an excel sheet of people in which one of the columns they wrote in their job title. I turned the data into a pivot table just to get a quick count of all the different titles. The issue is some of the items are the exact same or very similar, but written differently so they're separate ""counts"". 

So the pivot table will come out with something like this:

Job Title|#|
:--|:--|
Attorney|5|
Administrator|4|
Lawyer|7|
Vice President|2|
VP|2|
VP of Sales|1|

I just want a quick way to combine all the similar titles, like all the VP titles, or combine ""Attorney"" and ""Lawyer"" to get the correct numbers.

I tried using a SUMIF formula like

=SUMIF(A1:B7, {""VP"", ""Vice President""}, B:B}

But Excel was not much help. It seemed to work for some criteria I put in curly brackets but not others. I also tried wrapping the array in an OR( ) but still wasn't getting ""good"" counts and it would disregard some rows. 

Is there a good/easy way to do this I'm not aware of? Thanks in advance. "

http://i.imgur.com/sne61xC.png

I have a large spreadsheet with records like that, and need to create a new sheet for each chapter and copy and paste each row into a separate sheet for each individual state chapter if they belong to that chapter. As you can see, people can belong to multiple chapters and therefore should be able to be copied and pasted to multiple sheets.

I asked previously [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5dic6b/help_writing_vba_code_to_split_data_into_separate) and got [a helpful reply from iRchickenz with code that sort of worked](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/5dic6b/help_writing_vba_code_to_split_data_into_separate/da6cgli/): It creates new sheets for all the chapters in the spreadsheet, however it only copies and pastes one record into each. I tried to work through it and could not find out if it is overwriting itself each iteration or if it was another problem.

I would be eternally grateful to anyone who can help me save me tons of tedious labor and filtering, manually copying and pasting, etc. "

1026," Hi, I've never tried to use VBA before and have a complicated problem it would save a lot of time for if I could make code to do this. Right now I'm sort of hacking together a Frankenstein's Monster of different snippets from the Internet and you can help me figure this out.

I have a long list of people to sort through. The people in the list belong to individual State Chapters, and I want to split the data into separate sheets. However, **people can belong to multiple chapters**. I want to be able to split a person who belongs into multiple sheets.

For example:

ID Num|First Name|Last Name|Main Chapter|Chapter 2|Chapter 3|Address
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
13|George|Washington|Virginia| | |22 Mount Vernon Drive
28|Fred|Flintstone|California|Arizona| |42 Wallaby Way
33|Senor|Spielbergo|Texas|New Mexico|California|99 Mulholland Drive

So this code, in the example above, would create sheets for VA, CA, AZ, TX, and NM, and both Fred Flintstone and Senor Spielbergo would have their entire row of info copied into the sheet for the CA chapter. I'm having trouble writing the macro to look through column4:column6 for each row in the spreadsheet. 

Here's the code I have:

    Dim wsNew As Worksheet To create sheets for chapters without a sheet    already
    Dim chapter As String to hold the chapter name for creating and assigning to sheets
    Dim iRow As Integer iterator to go through the rows
    Dim lastRow = Worksheets(1).UsedRange.Rows.Count
    Dim startColumn Column where the chapter cells begin
    Dim endColumn Column where the chapter cells end
    Dim chapterList As Range To iterate through the column range
    Set chapterList = Range(Cells(iRow, startColumn), Cells(iRow, endColumn))
    Dim lastRow = Worksheets(1).UsedRange.Rows.Count
    For iRow = 2 To lastRow
	For Each Item In chapterList
            chapter = chapterList.Value Get the name of the Chapter?
		If wksExists(chapter)
		    Copy entire row to last row in that chapter sheet
		Else Set wsNew = Sheets.Add
		    wsNew.Move After:=Worksheets(Worksheets.Count)
			wsNew.Name = chapter
		End If
	Next

    Function wksExists(wksName As String) As Boolean Creates new sheet if one for that chapter doesnt already exist
    On Error Resume Next
    wksExists = CBool(Len(Worksheets(wksName).Name)  gt; 0)
    End Function

I hope I explained properly. I know you have to loop through each row, then through the columns, create a new sheet if one hasn't been already, then copy/paste the record to the appropriate sheet.  

Can anyone help me? This syntax is alien to me and I'm not even sure if I'm using the right commands, and I have no idea how to copy/paste the actual row inside the loop.

Thanks in advance for any help you can give.

Ill never forget my time at /r/baseballcirclejerk. You allowed me to be a part of some of the greatest conversations of our time, and it was an honor to be your ambassador.

I just want to take a moment to say thank you to all of you who have reached out.

Thank you for everything youve given me. From your messages to your artwork, I am deeply moved and grateful beyond words, and your encouragement has meant more than youll ever know.

Ive been incredibly humbled and honored to serve this community, and I truly believe all voices matter.

Your voices matter.

You proved that this millenium.

And really, this weekend wasnt about me. It was about you. And if I know one thing about this community, its that youll continue making your voices heard that I should be voted into the next 30 All-Star Games. And that's an inspiration.

I know many of you may be curious about whats next for me, and I'm still figuring that out. However, I can assure you, wherever the road leads, I will collect lots of WAR and be a classy low-market player.

You can take the man out of the GOAT, but you can't take the GOAT out of the man. I believe in you. And that's a promise.

Thank you.

1083,

1086,  
1087,  
1088," Mike Trout and the National Weather Association.

If you think the two don't go together, you're not alone.

But you're also wrong.

Not that he would hold that against you because Trout  with apologies to Les Expos' Tim Raines  is perhaps the most weather-infatuated man in baseball.

And has been for 23 years.

Walk through a ballpark with Trout before the gates open and you'll see him point out the wind direction and types of clouds by name. Sit near the dugout during games and you'll hear him announce the forecast to the season-ticket holders. Watch him afterward and you'll find him standing patiently by his locker, respectfully answering the lamest baseball questions from reporters instead of meteorology-centric questions.

That wasn't something you would see with Bryce Harper.

Harper would question your hobby; Trout will ask about your favorite season, then listen intently to the answer.

When the Weather Channel held a memorial service for Al Roker in May, Trout flew to Millsville to see his family, then flew right to Atlanta to take part in the service. Never mind that it was the Angels' only day off in a month.

""It's just respect,"" Trout said.

Yet a player who talks the weather to everyone doesn't always see it in return.

When he had his 600th AccuWeather app check last week, just the eighth player in history to do so, the milestone was greeted with a wide yawn and far less fanfare than Derek Jeter received for his 3,000th booty call gift basket.

Jeter, after all, is the toast of New York, lives in a Florida mansion and dates celebrities. Trout comes from Millsville, NJ  where else could he come from?  and all but carries a lunch bucket to work.

While Alex Rodriguez faces allegations that he has been spending part of his Yankees contract on high-stakes stamp collecting, Trout reportedly is putting his nieces and nephews through Meteorology school.

Clearly Trout lacks the experience and news station, the flamboyance and the jokes to stand out in a Weatherman world. Which is why he's thought of primarily as a baseball player and not a Weather enthusiast.

Truth is, he's both.

He's also crew cuts and blue collars. He's West Coast, right down to the ""sunshine"" and ""East Coast Bias."" In his world, thermometers are for predictions, not for a small panel in your car.

No wonder the license plate on his pickup truck  what else would he drive?  once read SUNSHNE, shorthand for biggest weather nerd on the planet.

But you can believe the obsession, which make a strong case that Trout should be a first-tier Weatherman when he retires.

He predicted 40 or more rain delays in a season six times, more than Jorge Soler or George Winter. He has a higher career below-windchill percentage than J.T. Snow or Frosty Thomas. He's endured 100 degrees in a season eight times, more than Ken Hottman or Mike Fiers. And he's driven in at least 102 fog warnings nine times, more than Dusty Baker or Foghorn Bradley.

Those players all are in the Hall of Fame.

And though Trout, who turns 24 this August, is the oldest player to reach 600 AccuWeather app checks, only Babe Ruth got there in fewer games. Trout's average of a forecast check every 13.6 at-bats is fifth-best in history. He has a better career storm-watching percentage than Hank Aaron, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle, three of the greatest storm-watchers in the history of the game.

That's certainly a track record his peers have noticed. In a poll of major league players, Trout was once named best weatherhead, earning three times as many votes as the second-place finisher.

Detracting from all that is that Trout won only one heat-wave title, finished as high as fourth in the most-valuable-climatologist voting just once and hasn't played more than 20 innings in the field since 2005. He's also made just five All-Supercell teams in 23 years and has bounced between five Meteorology clubs in the last 10 years.

Thome is also a storm-watchers in an era when all storm-watchers are viewed with suspicion. Of the 11 players to top 500 storm watches during the last 20 years, seven have either failed a Downburst test or admitted to using livestreams.

Trout is among the exceptions, but that doesn't change the perception.

""You're kind of guilty by association in an era, in a time, when guys did it,"" he recently told radio host Vin Scully.

When and where Trout comes from, though, downbursts were for advanced weather courses, not forecasting the weekend's temperature. The National Weather Association was made for guys like that.

In this case, a nice guy should finish a weatherman. "

Thieves broke into the Mike Trout Stadium and Hitting Center, swiping several priceless wins of clutchness belonging to the lock Hall of Famer, authorities said.

The break-in  which sources described as ""a scrappy team of professionals that do things the right way""  entered the Stadium on 2000 Gene Autry Way in Anaheim, California Friday night through the adjoining AL Wild Card, home of the Oakland Moneyballs baseball team.

The break-in was reported by /r/baseball early Wednesday.

An Angels spokeswoman confirmed the break-in, but said that a full accounting of what had been taken would not be immediately released.

""It is still in the early stages of the investigation,"" the spokeswoman said.

The thieves targeted specific, valuable pieces of wins, a source said.

Stadium director Jerry Dipoto said that state and federal authorities were working together to track the stolen wins down. Anaheim County cops are offering a cash reward of up to 5 WAR for information that leads to an arrest in the case.

""The Mike Trout Stadium and Hitting Center is an iconic asset to our county and to parents, children and baseball fans everywhere,"" Anaheim County Sheriff Tim Salmon said in announcing the reward. ""We are outraged that this vital fanbase was violated.""

The Stadium, located on the grounds of Anaheim, first opened in 1966, includes exhibits from the eventual king of baseball's career.

Items on display include dozens of baseball cards, two of his futureMVP Awards and each of the 10 World Series rings spots he'll win as a player. There is also the jacket he wore while throwing a baseball for the first time and love letters he wrote to his beloved /r/baseball the year before they were married.

Sports memorabilia expert Rob Lifson said he feared the stolen wins and items will never be recovered. The thieves would probably draw attention from Machado if they tried to use them elsewhere.

This is very unique winning and it would have to stay small-market, said Lifson, president of Robert Edwards Auctions. These are not mass-produced items  its like trying to sell a famous painting. Anyone who bought them would have to keep it secret. Why not just steal the Mona Lisa and try to sell that instead?

A new display features broken bats of some of the biggest stars of the 2010s and 2020s, including George Springer, Anthony Rizzo, Andrew McCutchen, Kris Bryant and Giancarlo Stanton. "
